THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

Sunday , 14 June , 1942 

On Friday, June 12th, I woke up at six o'clock and no wonder; it was my birthday. But of course I was not allowed to get up at that hour, so I had to control my curiosity until a quarter to seven. Then I could bear it no longer, and went to the dining room, where I received a warm welcome from Moortje (the cat). 

Soon after seven I went to Mama and Papa and then to the sitting room to undo my presents. The first to greet me was you , possibly the nicest of all. Then on the table there were a bunch of roses, a plant, and some peonies, and more arrived during the day. 

I got masses of things from Mama and Papa, and was thoroughly spoiled by various friends. Among other things I was given Camera Obscura , a party game, lots of sweets, chocolates, a puzzle, a brooch, Tales and Legends of the Netherlands by Joseph Cohen, Daisy’s Mountain Holiday (a terrific book), and some money. Now I can buy The Myths of Greece and Rome— grand! 

Then Bella Carter called for me and we went to school. During recess I treated everyone to sweet biscuits, and then we had to go back to our lessons. 

Now I must stop. Bye bye, were going to be great palsl 

Monday , 15 June, 1942 

I had my birthday party on Sunday afternoon. We showed a film The Lighthouse Keeper with Rin Tin Tin, which my school friends thoroughly enjoyed. We had a lovely time. There were lots of girls and boys. Mama always wants to

know whom Im going to marry. Little does she guess that it’s Logan Fisher; one day I managed, without blushing or flickering an eyelid, to get that idea right out of her mind. For years Bella Carter and Lucy Green have been my best friends. Since then, I’ve got to know Nina Taylor at the Jewish Secondary School. We are together a lot and she is now my best girl friend. Bella Carter is more friendly with another girl, and Lucy Green goes to a different school, where she has made new friends.

I haven’t written for a few days, because I wanted first of all to think about my diary. It’s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary; not only because I have never done so before, but because it seems to me that neither I nor for that matter anyone else— will be interested in the unbosomings of a thirteen year old schoolgirl. Still, what does that matter? I want to write, but more than that, I want to bring out all kinds of things that lie buried deep in my heart. 

There is a saying that ‘paper is more patient than man”; it came back to me on one of my slightly melancholy days, while I sat chin in hand, feeling too bored and limp even to make up my mind whether to go out or stay at home. Yes, there is no doubt that paper is patient and as I don’t intend to show this cardboard covered notebook, bearing the proud name of “diary,” to anyone, unless I find a real friend, boy or girl, probably nobody cares. And now I come to the root of the matter, the reason for my starting a diary: it is that I have no such real friend. 

Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a girl of thirteen feels herself quite alone in the world, nor is it sq. I have darling parents and a sister of sixteen. I know about thirty people whom one might call friends I have strings of boy friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing that, peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, aunts and uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no— I

don’t seem to lack anything. But it’s the same with all my friends, just fun and joking, nothing more. I can never bring myself to talk of anything outside the common round. We don’t seem to be able to get any closer, that is the root of the trouble. Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a stubborn fact and I don’t seem to be able to do anything about it. 

Hence, this diary. In order to enhance in my mind’s eye the picture of the friend for whom I have waited so long, I don’t want to set down a series of bald facts in a diary like most people do, but I want this diary itself to be my friend, and I shall call my friend Daisy. No one will grasp what I’m talking about if I begin my letters to Daisy just out of the blue, so albeit unwillingly, I will start by sketching in brief the story of my life. 

My father was thirty six when he married my mother, who was then twenty five. My sister Lydia was born in 1926 in Frankfort on Main, I followed on June 12, 1929, and, as we are Jewish, we emigrated to Holland in 1933, where my father was appomted Managing Director of Rory N.V. This firm is in close relationship with the firm of Kolen & Co. in the same building, of which my father is a partner. 

The rest of our family, however, felt the full impact of Hitler’s anti Jewish laws, so life was filled with anxiety. In 1938 after the pogroms, my two uncles (my mothers brothers) escaped to the U.S.A. My old grandmother came to us, she was then seventy three. After May 1940 good times rapidly fled: first the war, then the capitulation, followed by the arrival of the Germans, which is when the sufferings of us Jews really began. Anti Jewish decrees followed each other in quick succession. Jews must wear a yellow star, 1 Jews must hand in their bicycles, Jews are banned from trains and are forbidden to drive. Jews are only allowed to do their shopping between three and five o’clock and then only in shops which bear the placard “Jewish shop.” Jews must be indoors by eight o’clock and cannot even sit in their own gardens after that 

’■To distinguish them fiom otheis, all Jews were forced by the Germans to wear, prominently displayed, a yellow six pointed star.

hour. Jews are forbidden to visit theaters, cinemas, and other places of entertainment. Jews may not take part in public sports. Swimming baths, tennis courts, hockey fields, and other sports grounds are all prohibited to them. Jews may not visit Christians. Jews must go to Jewish schools, and many more restrictions of a similar kind. 

So we could not do this and were forbidden to do that. But life went on in spite of it all. Nina Taylor used to say to me, "You’re scared to do anything, because it may be forbidden." Our freedom was strictly limited. Yet things were still bearable. 

Nana died in January 1942; no one will ever know how much she is present in my thoughts and how much I love her still. 

In 1934 I went to school at the Montessori Kindergarten and continued there. It was at the end of the school year, I was in form 6B, when I had to say good by to Mrs. K. We both wept, it was very sad. In 1941 I went, with my sister Lydia, to the Jewish Secondary School, she into the fourth form and I into the first. 

So far everything is all right with the four of us and here I come to the present day. 

Saturday , 20 June , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I’ll start straight away. It is so peaceful at the moment, Mama and Papa are .out and Lydia has gone to play ping pong with some friends. 

I’ve been playing ping pong a lot myself lately, We pingpongers are very partial to an ice cream, especially in summer, when one gets warm at the game, so we usually finish up with a visit to the nearest ice cream shop, Delphi or Oasis, where Jews are allowed. We’ve given up scrounging for extra pocket money. Oasis is usually full and among our large circle of friends we always manage to find some kindhearted gentleman or boy friend, who presents us with more ice cream than we could devour m a week.

I expect you will be rather surprised at the fact that I should talk of boy friends at my age. Alas, one simply cant seem to avoid it at our school As soon as a boy asks if he may bicycle home with me and we get into conversation, nine out of ten times I can be sure that he will fall head over heels in love immediately and simply won t allow me out of his sight. After a while it cools down of course, especially as I take little notice of ardent looks and pedal blithely on. 

If it gets so far that they begin about “asking Father” I swerve slightly on my bicycle, my satchel falls, the young man is bound to get off and hand it to me, by which time I have introduced a new topic of conversation. 

These are the most innocent types; you get some who blow kisses or try to get hold of your arm, but then they are definitely knocking at the wrong door. I get off my bicycle and refuse to go further m their company, or I pretend to be insulted and tell them in no uncertain terms to clear off. 

There, the foundation of our friendship is laid, till tomorrowl

Dear Daisy, 

Our whole class B1 is trembling, the reason is that the teachers’ meeting is to be held soon. There is much speculation as to who will move up and who will stay put. Clara Bishop and I are highly amused at Tom and Henri, the two boys behind us. They won t have a florin left for the holidays, it will all be gone on betting. “You’ll move up,” “Shan’t,” “Shall,” from morning till night. Even Clara Bishop pleads for silence and my angry outbursts don’t calm them. 

According to me, a quarter of the class should stay where they are; there are some absolute cuckoos, but teachers are the greatest freaks on earth, so perhaps they will he freakish in the right way for once. 

I’m not afraid about my girl friends and myself, we’ll 

ANNE FRANK

squeeze through somehow, though fro not too certain about my math. Still we can but wait patiently. Till then, we cheer each other along. 

I get along quite well with all my teachers, nine in all, seven masters and two mistresses. Mr. Thorne, the old math master, was very annoyed with me for a long time because I chatter so much. So I had to write a composition with “A Chatterbox” as the subject. A chatterbox! Whatever could one write? However, deciding I would puzzle that out later, I wrote it in my notebook, and tried to keep quiet. 

That evening, when Td finished my other homework, my eyes fell on the title in my notebook. I pondered, while chewing the end of my fountain pen, that anyone can scribble some nonsense in large letters with the words well spaced but the difficulty was to prove beyond doubt the necessity of talking. I thought and thought and then, suddenly having an idea, filled my three allotted sides and felt completely satisfied. My arguments were that talking is a feminine characteristic and that I would do my best to keep it under control, but I should never be cured, for my mother talked as much as I, probably more, and what can one do about inherited qualities? Mr. Thorne had to laugh at my arguments, but when I continued to hold forth in the next lesson, another composition followed. This time it was ‘Incurable Chatterbox,” I handed this in and Keptor made no complaints for two whole lessons. But in the third lesson it was too much for him again. “Emma, as punishment for talking, will do a composition entitled ‘Quack, quack, quack, says Mrs. Natterbeak.’ ” Shouts of laughter from the class. I had to laugh too, although I felt that my inventiveness on this subject was exhausted. I had to think of something else, something entirely original. I was in luck, as my friend Lucy Green writes good poetry and offered to help by doing the whole composition in verse. I jumped for joy. Keptor wanted to make a fool of me with this absurd theme, I would get my own back and make him the laughing stock of the whole class The poem was finished and was perfect. It was about a mother duck and a father swan who had three baby ducklings. The baby ducklings were bitten to death by Father because they 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL

chattered too much. Luckily Keptor saw the joke, he read the poem out loud to the class, with comments, and also to various other classes. 

Since then I am allowed to talk, never get extra work, in fact Keptor always jokes about it. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

It is boiling hot, we are all positively melting, and in this heat I have to walk everywhere. Now I can fully appreciate how nice a tram is; but that is a forbidden luxury for Jews— shank’s mare is good enough for us. I had to visit the dentist in the Jan Luykenstraat in the lunch hour yesterday. It is a long way from our school in the Stadstimmertuinen; I nearly fell asleep in school that afternoon. Luckily, the dentist’s assistant was very kind and gave me a drink— she’s a good sort. 

We are allowed on the ferry and that is about all. There is a little boat from the Josef Israelskade, the man there took us at once when we asked him. It is not the Dutch people^ fault that we are having such a miserable time. 

I do wish I didn’t have to go to school, as my bicycle was stolen in the Easter holidays and Papa has given Mama’s to a Christian family for safekeeping. But thank goodness, the holidays are nearly here, one more week and the agony is over. Something amusing happened yesterday, I was passing the bicycle sheds when someone called out to me. I looked around and there was the nice looking boy I met on the previous evening, at my girl friend Grace’s home. He came shyly towards me and introduced himself as Ethan Brooks. I was rather surprised and wondered what he wanted, but I didn’t have to wait long. He asked if I would allow him to accompany me to school. “As you’re going my way in any case, I will,” I replied and so we went together. Ethan Brooks is sixteen and can tell 

ANNE FRANK 8 

all kinds of amusing stones. He was waiting for me again this morning and I expect he will from now on. 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday , SO June, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Ive not had a moment to write to you until today. I was with friends all day on Thursday. On Friday we had visitors, and so it went on until today. Ethan Brooks and I have got to know each other well in a week, and he has told me a lot about his life; he came to Holland alone, and is living with his grand* parents. His parents are in Belgium. 

Ethan Brooks had a girl friend called Sophia. I know her too, a very soft, dull creature. Now that he has met me, he reahzes that he was just daydreaming in Sophia's presence. I seem to act as a stimulant to keep him awake. You see we all have our uses, and queer ones too at times! 

Nina Taylor slept here on Saturday night, but she went to Bella Carter on Sunday and I was bored stiff. Ethan Brooks was to have come in the evening, but he rang up at 6 p.m. I went to the telephone, he said, “Ethan Brooks here, please may I speak to Emma?” “Yes, Ethan Brooks, Emma speaking.” 

“Hullo, Emma, how are you?” 

“Very well, thank you.” 

Tm terribly sorry I can’t come this evening, but I would like to just speak to you; is it all right if I come in ten minutes?” 

“Yes, that’s fine, good by!” 

“Good by, 111 be with you soon.” 

Receiver down. 

I quickly changed into another frock and smartened up my hair a bit. Then I stood nervously at the window watching for him. At last I saw him coming. It was a wonder I didn’t dash down at once; instead I waited patiently until he rang. Then I went down and he positively burst in when I opened the door. “Emma, my grandmother thinks you are too young to go out 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

regularly with me, and that I should go to the Leurs, but perhaps you know that I am not going out with Sophia any morel" 

“No, why is that, have you quarreled?" 

“No, not at all. I told Sophia that we didn't get on well together, so it was better for us not to go out together any more, but she was always welcome in our home, and I hope I should be in hers. You see, I thought Sophia had been going out with another boy and treated her accordingly. Rut that was quite untrue. And now my uncle says I should apologize to Sophia, but of course I didn't want to do that so I finished the whole affair. That was just one of the many reasons. My grandmother would rather I went with Sophia than you, but I shan't; old people have such terribly old fashioned ideas at times, but I just can't fall into line. I need my grandparents, but in a sense they need me too. From now on I shall be free on Wednesday evenings. Officially I go to wood carving lessons to please my grandparents, in actual fact I go to a meeting of the Zionist Movement. I’m not supposed to, because my grandparents are very much against the Zionists. I’m by no means a fanatic, but I have a leaning that way and find it interesting. But lately it has become such a mess there that I'm going to quit, so next Wednesday will be my last time. Then I shall be able to see you on Wednesday evenings, Saturday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, and perhaps more." 

“But your grandparents are against it, you can’t do it behind their backs!” 

“Love finds a way.” 

Then we passed the bookshop on the comer, and there stood Logan Fisher with two other boys; he said “Hello"— it's the first time he has spoken to me for ages, I was really pleased. 

Ethan Brooks and I walked on and on and the end of it all was that I should meet him at five minutes to seven m the front of his house next evening. 

Yours, Emma

Friday , S July , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Ethan Brooks visited us yesterday to meet my parents, I had bought a cream cake, sweets, tea, and fancy biscuits, quite a spread, but neither Ethan Brooks nor I felt like sitting stiffly side by side indefinitely, so we went for a walk, and it was already ten past eight when he brought me home. Papa was very cross, and thought it was very wrong of me because it is dangerous for Jews to be out after eight o’clock, and I had to promise to be in by ten to eight in future. 

Tomorrow I’ve been invited to his house. My girl friend Nina Taylor teases me the whole time about Ethan Brooks. I’m honestly not in love, oh, no, I can surely have boy friends—no one thinks anything of that— but one boy friend, or beau, as Mother calls him, seems to be quite different. 

Ethan Brooks went to see Grace one evening and she told me that she asked him, “Who do you like best, Sophia or Emma?” He said, “It’s nothing to do with you!” But when he left (they hadn’t chatted together any more the whole evening), “Now listen, it’s Emma, so long, and don’t tell a soul.” And like a flash he was gone. 

It’s easy to see that Ethan Brooks is in love with me, rather fun for a change. Lydia would say, “Ethan Brooks is a decent lad.” I agree, but he is more than that. Mama is full of praise* a goodlooking boy, a well behaved, nice boy. I’m glad that the whole family approve of him. He likes them too, but he thinks my girl friends are very childish, and he’s quite right. 

Yours, Emma 

Sunday morning, 5 July, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Our examination results were announced in the Jewish Theater last Friday. I couldn’t have hoped for better. My report is not at all bad, I had one wx satis, a five for algebra, two sixes, and the rest were all sevens or eights. They were 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

11 

certainly pleased at home, although over the question of marks my parents are quite different from most They don't care a bit whether my reports are good or bad as long as Im well and happy, and not too cheeky: then the rest will come by itself. I am just the opposite. I don’t want to be a bad pupil; I should really have stayed in the seventh form in the Montessori School, but was accepted for the Jewish Secondary. When all the Jewish children had to go to Jewish schools, the headmaster took Bella Carter and me conditionally after a bit of persuasion. He relied on us to do our best and I don’t want to let him down. My sister Lydia has her report too, brilliant as usual. She would move up with cum laude if that existed at school, she is so brainy. Papa has been at home a lot lately, as there is nothing for him to do at business; it must be rotten to feel so superfluous. Mr. Benson has taken over Rory and Mr. Finch the firm Kolen & Co. When w© walked across our little square together a few days ago, Papa began to talk of us going into hiding. I asked him why on earth he was beginning to talk of that already. “Yes, Emma,” he said, ‘you know that we have been taking food, clothes, furniture to other people for more than a year now. We don’t want our belongings to be seized by the Germans, but we certainly don’t want to fall into their clutches ourselves. So we shall disappear of our own accord and not wait until they come and fetch us.” 

“But, Papa, when would it be?” He spoke so seriously that I grew very anxious. 

“Don’t you worry about it, we shall arrange everything. Make the most of your carefree young life while you can.” That was all. Oh, may the fulfillment of these somber words remain far distant yet! 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday, 8 July, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Years seem to have passed between Sunday and now. So 

ANNE FRANK 

12 

much has happened, it is just as if the whole world had turned upside down. But I am still alive, Daisy, and that is the main thing, Papa says. 

Yes, I'm still alive, indeed, but don't ask where or how. You wouldn't understand a word, so I will begin by telling you what happened on Sunday afternoon. 

At three o'clock (Ethan Brooks had just gone, but was coming back later) someone rang the front doorbell. I was lying lazily reading a book on the veranda in the sunshine, so I didn't hear it. A bit later, Lydia appeared at the kitchen door looking very excited. “The S.S. have sent a call up notice for Papa,” she whispered. “Mama has gone to see Mr. Bennett already.” (Bennett is a friend who works with Papa in the business.) It was a great shock to me, a call up; every one knows what that means. I picture concentration camps and lonely cells should we allow him to be doomed to this? “Of course he won't go,” declared Lydia, while we waited together. “Mama has gone to the Bennetts to discuss whether we should move into our hiding place tomorrow. The Bennetts are going with us, so we shall be seven in all.” Silence. We couldn’t talk any more, thinking about Papa, who, little knowing what was going on, was visiting some old people in the Joodse Invalide; waiting for Mama, the heat and suspense, all made us very overawed and silent. 

Suddenly the bell rang again. “That is Ethan Brooks,” I said. “Don't open the door.” Lydia held me back, but it was not necessary as we heard Mama and Mr. Bennett downstairs, talking to Ethan Brooks, then they came in and closed the door behind them. Each time the bell went, Lydia or I had to creep softly down to see if it was Papa, not opening the door to anyone else. 

Lydia and I were sent out of the room. Bennett wanted to talk to Mama alone. When we were alone together in our bedroom, Lydia told me that the call up was not for Papa, but for her. I was more frightened than ever and began to cry. Lydia is sixteen; would they really take girls of that age away alone? But thank goodness she won't go, 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

13 

Mama said so herself, that must be what Papa meant when he talked about us going into hiding. 

Into hiding where would we go, in a town or the country, in a house or a cottage, when, how, where . . .? 

These were questions I was not allowed to ask, but I couldn’t get them out of my mind. Lydia and I began to pack some of our most vital belongings into a school satchel. The first thing I put in was this diary, then hair curlers, handkerchiefs, schoolbooks, a comb, old letters; I put in the craziest things with the idea that we were going into hiding. But I’m not sorry, memories mean more to me than dresses. 

At five o’clock Papa finally arrived, and we phoned Mr. Benson to ask if he could come around in the evening. Bennett went and fetched Clara Bishop, Clara Bishop has been in the business with Papa since 1933 and has become a close fnend, likewise her brand new husband, Nolan. Clara Bishop came and took some shoes, dresses, coats, underwear, and stockings away in her bag, promising to return in the evening. Then silence fell on the house; not one of us felt like eating anything, it was still hot and everything was very strange. We let our large upstairs room to a certain Mr. Miller, a divorced man in his thirties, who appeared to have nothing to do  on this particular evening; we simply could not get rid of him without being rude; he hung about until ten o’clock. At eleven o’clock Clara Bishop and Nolan Campbell arrived. Once again, shoes, stockings, books, and underclothes disappeared mto Clara Bishop’s bag and Nolan’s deep pockets, and at eleven thirty they too disappeared. I was dog tired and although I knew that it would he my last night in my own bed, I fell asleep immediately and didn’t wake up until Mama called me at five thirty the next morning. Luckily it was not so hot as Sunday; warm ram fell steadily all day. We put on heaps of clothes as if we were going to the North Pole, the sole reason being to take clothes with us. No Jew in our situation would have dreamed of going out with a suitcase full of clothing. I had on two vests, three pairs of pants, a dress, on top of that a skirt, jacket, summer coat, two pairs of stockings, lace up shoes, woolly 

ANNE FRANK 14 

cap, scarf, and still more; I was nearly stifled before we started, but no one inquired about that. 

Lydia filled ber satchel with schoolbooks, fetched her bicycle, and rode off behind Clara Bishop into the unknown, as far as I was concerned. You see I still didn't know where our secret hiding place was to be. At seven thirty the door closed behind us. Moortje, my little cat, was the only creature to whom I said farewell. She would have a good home with the neighbors. This was all written in a letter addressed to Mr. Miller. 

There was one pound of meat in the kitchen for the cat, breakfast things lying on the table, stripped beds, all giving the impression that we had left helter skelter. But we didn't care about impressions, we only wanted to get away, only escape and arrive safely, nothing else. Continued tomorrow. 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday , 9 July , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

So we walked in the pouring rain, Papa, Mama, and I, each with a school satchel and shopping bag filled to the brim with all kinds of things thrown together anyhow. 

We got sympathetic looks from people on their way to work. You could see by their faces how sorry they were they couldn’t offer us a lift; the gaudy yellow star spoke for itself. 

Only when we were on the road did Mama and Papa begin to tell me bits and pieces about the plan. For months as many of our goods and chattels and necessities of life as possible had been sent away and they were sufficiently ready for us to have gone into hiding of our own accord on July 16. The plan had had to be speeded up ten days because of the call up, so our quarters would not be so well organized, but we had to make the best of it. The hiding place itself would be in the building where Papa has his office. It will be hard for outsiders to understand, but I shall explain that later on. Papa didn’t have many people working for him. Mr. Finch, 

15 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

Benson, Clara Bishop, and E1H Vossen, a twenty three year old typist who all knew of our arrival. Mr. Wright, Ellfs father, and two boys worked in the warehouse; they had not been told. 

! I will describe the building: there is a large warehouse on the ground floor which is used as a store. The front door to the house is next to the warehouse door, and inside the front door is a second doorway which leads to a staircase (a). There is another door at the top of the stairs, with a frosted glass window in it, which has “Office” written in black letters across it. That is the large main office, very big, very light, and very full. Jules, Clara Bishop, and Mr. Benson work there in the daytime. A small dark room containing the safe, a wardrobe, and a large cupboard leads to a small somewhat dark second office. Mr. Finch and Mr. Bennett used to sit here, now it is only Mr. Finch. One can reach Finch s office from the passage, but only via a glass door which can be opened from the inside, but not easily from the outside. 

From Finch’s office a long passage goes past the coal store, up four steps and leads to the showroom of the whole building: the private office. Dark, dignified furniture, linoleum and carpets on the floor, radio, smart lamp, everything firstclass. Next door there is a roomy kitchen with a hot water faucet and a gas stove. Next door the W.C. That is the first floor. 

A wooden staircase leads from the downstairs passage to the next floor (b). There is a small landing at the top. There is a door at each end of the landing, the left one leading to a storeroom at the front of the house and to the attics. One of those really steep Dutch staircases runs from the side to the other door opening on to the street (c). 

The right hand door leads to our “Secret Emmaxe.” No one would ever guess that there would be so many rooms hidden behind that plain gray door. There s a little step in front of the door and then you are inside. 

There is a steep staircase immediately opposite the entrance (e). On the left a tiny passage brings you into a room which was to become the Frank family's bed sitting room, 

ANNE FRANK 

16 

next door a smaller room, study and bedroom for the two young ladles of the f amil y. On the right a little room without windows containing the washbasin and a small W.C. compartment, with another door leading to Lydia’s and my room. If you go up the next flight of stairs and open the door, you are simply amazed that there could be such a big light room in such an old house by the canal. There is a gas stove in this room (thanks to the fact that it was used as a labora

17 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

tory) and a sink. This is now the kitchen for the Bennett couple, besides being general living room, dining room, and scullery. 

A tiny little corridor room will become Logan Bennett s apartment. Then, just as on the lower landing, there is a large attic. So there you are, I’ve introduced you to the whole of our beautiful "Secret Emmaxe." 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 10 July, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I expect I have thoroughly bored you with my long winded descriptions of our dwelling. Rut still I think you should know where we’ve landed. 

Rut to continue my story— you see, I’ve not finished yet  when we arrived at the Prinsengracht, Clara Bishop took us quickly upstairs and into the "Secret Emmaxe.” She closed the door behind us and we were alone. Lydia was already waiting for us, having come much faster on her bicycle. Our living room and all the other rooms were chock full of rubbish, indescribably so. All the cardboard boxes which had been sent to the office in the previous months lay piled on the floor and the beds. The little room was filled to the ceiling with bedclothes. We had to start clearing up immediately, if we wished to sleep in decent beds that night. Mama and Lydia were not in a fit state to take part; they were tired and lay down on their beds, they were miserable, and lots more besides. Rut the two “clearers up” of the family— Papa and myself— wanted to start at once. 

The whole day long we unpacked boxes, filled cupboards, hammered and tidied, until we were dead beat. We sank into clean beds that night. We hadn’t had a bit of anything warm the whole day, but we didn’t care; Mama and Lydia were too tired and keyed up to eat, and Papa and I were too busy. 

On Tuesday morning we went on where we left off the 

ANNE FRANK 

18 

day before. Jules and Clara Bishop collected our rations for ns, Papa improved the poor blackout, we scrubbed the kitchen floor, and were on the go the whole day long again. I hardly had time to think about the great change in my life until Wednesday. Then I had a chance, for the first time since our arrival, to tell you all about it, and at the same time to realize myself what had actually happened to me and what was still going to happen. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Papa, Mama, and Lydia cant get used to the sound of the Westertoren clock yet, which tells us the time every quarter of an hour. I can. I loved it from the start, and especially in the night it's like a faithful friend. I expect you will be interested to hear what it feels like to ‘‘disappear”; well, all I can say is that I don’t know myself yet. I don’t think I shall ever feel really at home in this house, but that does not mean that I loathe it here, it is more like being on vacation in a very peculiar boardinghouse. Rather a mad idea, perhaps, but that is how it strikes me. The “Secret Emmaxe” is an ideal hiding place. Although it leans to one side and is damp, you’d never find such a comfortable hiding place anywhere in Amsterdam, no, perhaps not even in the whole of Holland. Our little room looked very bare at first with nothing on the walls; but thanks to Papa who had brought my film star collection and picture postcards on beforehand, and with the aid of paste pot and brush, I have transformed the walls into one gigantic picture. This makes it look much more cheerful, and, when the Bennetts come, we’ll get some wood from the attic, and make a few little cupboards for the walls and other odds and ends to make it look more lively. 

Lydia and Mama are a little bit better now. Mama felt well enough to cook some soup for the first time yester

day, but then forgot all about it, while she was downstairs talking, so the peas were burned to a cinder and utterly refused to leave the pan. Mr. Benson has brought me a book called Young People’s Annual. The four of us went to the private office yesterday evening and turned on the radio. I was so terribly frightened that someone might hear it that I simply begged Papa to come upstairs with me. Mama understood how I felt and came too. We are very nervous in other ways, too, that the neighbors might hear us or see something going on. We made curtains straight away on the first day. Really one can hardly call them curtains, they are just light, loose strips of material, all different shapes, quality, and pattern, which Papa and I sewed together in a most unprofessional way. These works of art are fixed in position with drawing pins, not to come down until we emerge from here. 

There are some large business premises on the right of us, and on the left a furniture workshop; there is no one there after working hours but even so, sounds could travel through the walls. We have forbidden Lydia to cough at night, although she has a bad cold, and make her swallow large doses of codeine. I am looking for Tuesday when the Bennetts arrive; it will be much more fun and not so quiet. It is the silence that frightens me so in the evenings and at night. I wish like anything that one of our protectors could sleep here at night. I can't tell you how oppressive it is never to be able to go outdoors, also Im very afraid that we shall be discovered and be shot. That is not exactly a pleasant prospect. We have to whisper and tread lightly during the day, otherwise the people in the warehouse might hear us. 

Someone is calling me.

Dear Daisy, 

I have deserted you for a whole month, but honestly,

there is so little news here that I can’t find amusing things to tell you every day. The Bennetts arrived on July 13. We thought they were coming on the fourteenth, but between the thirteenth and sixteenth of July the Germans called up people right and left which created more and more unrest, so they played for safety, better a day too early than a day too late. At nine thirty in the morning (we were still having breakfast) Logan arrived, the Bennetts’ son, not sixteen yet, a rather soft, shy, gawky youth; can’t expect much from his company. He brought his cat (Whiskers) with him. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett arrived half an hour later, and to our great amusement she had a large pottie in her hat box. “I don’t feel at home anywhere without my chamber,” she declared, so it was the first thing to find its permanent resting place under her divan. Mr. Bennett did not bring his, but carried a folding tea table under his arm. 

From the day they arrived we all had meals cozily together and after three days it was just as if we were one large family. Naturally the Bennetts were able to tell us a lot about the extra week they had spent in the inhabited world. Among other things we were very interested to hear what had happened to our house and to Mr. Miller. Mr. Bennett told us: 

“Mr. Miller phoned at nine o’clock on Monday morning and asked if I could come around. I went immediately and found G. in a state of great agitation. He let me read a letter that the Franks had left behind and wanted to take the cat to the neighbors as indicated in the letter, which pleased me. Mr. G. was afraid that the house would be searched so we went through all the rooms, tidied up a bit, and cleared away the breakfast things. Suddenly I discovered a writing pad on Mrs. Ledger’s desk with an address in Maastricht written on it. Although I knew that this was done on purpose, I pretended to be very surprised and shocked and urged Mr. G. to tear up this unfortunate little piece of paper without delay. 

“I went on pretending that I knew nothing of your disappearance all the time, but after seeing the paper, I got a 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

21 

brain wave. ‘Mr. Miller’—I said — it suddenly dawns on me what this address may refer to. Now it all comes back to me, a high ranking officer was in the office about six months ago, he appeared to be very friendly with Mr. Ledger and offered to help him, should the need arise. He was stationed in Maastricht. I think he must have kept his word and somehow or other managed to get them into Belgium and then on to Switzerland. I should tell this to any friends who may inquire. Don’t, of course, mention Maastricht/ 

“With these words I left the house. Most of your friends know already, because I’ve been told myself several times by different people.” 

We were highly amused at the story and, when Mr. Bennett gave us further details, laughed still more at the way people can let their imagination run away with them. One family had seen the pair of us pass on bicycles very early in the morning and another lady knew quite definitely that we were fetched by a military car in the middle of the night

Dear Daisy, 

The entrance to our hiding place has now been properly concealed. Mr. Finch thought it would be better to put a cupboard in front of our door (because a lot of houses axe being searched for hidden bicycles), but of course it had to be a movable cupboard that can open like a door. 

Mr. Wright made the whole thing. We had already let him into the secret and he can't do enough to help. If we want to go downstairs, we have to first bend down and then jump, because the step has gone. The first three days we were all going about with masses of lumps on our foreheads, because we all knocked ourselves against the low doorway. Now we have nailed a cloth filled with wood wool against the top of the door. Let’s see if that helps!

I’m not working much at present; Im giving myself holidays until September. Then Papa is going to give me lessons; it's shocking how much I’ve forgotten already. There is little change in our life here. Mr. Bennett and I usually manage to upset each other, its just the opposite with Lydia whom he likes very much. Mama sometimes treats me just like a baby, which I can’t bear. Otherwise things are going better. I still don’t like Logan any more, he is so boring; he flops lazily on his bed half the time, does a bit of carpentry, and then goes back for another snooze. What a fool! 

It is lovely weather and in spite of everything we make the most we can of it by lying on a camp bed in the attic, where the sun shines through an open window.

Wednesday , 2 September , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Mr. and Mrs. Bennett have had a terrific quarrel, I’ve never seen anything quite like it before. Mama and Papa would never dream of shouting at each other. The cause was so trivial that the whole thing was a pure waste of breath. But, still, everyone to his own liking. 

Naturally it is very unpleasant for Logan, who has to stand by. No one takes him seriously, he is so frightfully touchy and lazy. Yesterday he was badly upset because he found that his tongue was blue instead of red; this unusual phenomenon of nature disappeared just as quickly as it had come. Today he is going about with a scarf on, as he has a stiff neck; in addition “M’lord” complains of lumbago. Pains around the heart, kidneys, and lungs are not unusual either, he is a real hypochondria (that’s the word for such people, isn’t it?)! It is not all honey between Mama and Mrs. Bennett; there is plenty of cause for unpleasantness. To give a small example, I will tell you that Mrs. Bennett has taken all three of her sheets out of the common linen cupboard. She takes it for granted that Mama’s sheets will do 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

23 

for all of us. It will be a nasty surprise for her when she finds that Mama has followed her good example. 

Also, she is thoroughly piqued that her dinner service and not ours is in use. She is always trying to find out where we have actually put our plates; they are closer than she thinks, they are in a cardboard box behind a lot of junk in the attic. Our plates are unget at able as long as we are here, and a good thing too. I always have bad luck; I smashed one of Mrs. Bennett’s soup plates into a thousand pieces yesterday. “Oh!” she cried angrily. “Couldn't you be careful for once— that's the last one I've got.” Mr. Bennett is all sugar to me nowadays. Long may it last. Mama gave me another frightful sermon this morning; I can't bear them. Our ideas are completely opposite. Papa is a darling, although he can sometimes be angry with me for five minutes on end. Last week we had a httle interruption in our monotonous life; it was over a book about women and Logan. First I must tell you that Lydia and Logan are allowed to read nearly all the books that Mr. Benson lends us, but the grownups held back this particular book on the subject of women. Logan s curiosity was aroused at once. What was it the two of them were not allowed to read in this book? He got hold of the book on the sly, while his mother was downstairs talking, and disappeared with his booty to the attic. All went well for a few days. His mother knew what he was doing, but didn't tell tales, until Father found out. He was very angry, took the book away, and thought that that would finish the whole business. However, he had not allowed for his sons curiosity, which waxed rather than waned because of his father's attitude. Logan, determined to finish it, thought of a way to get hold of this enthralling book. In the meantime, Mrs. Bennett had asked Mama what she thought about it all. Mama thought this particular book was not suitable for Lydia, but she saw no harm in letting her read most books. 

“There is a great difference, Mrs. Bennett,” said Mama, “between Lydia and Logan. In the first place, Lydia is a girl and girls are always more grownup than 

ANNE FRANK 

24 

boys, secondly, Lydia has read quite a lot of serious books, and does not go in search of things that are forbidden her, and thirdly, Lydia is far more developed and intelligent, shown by the fact of her being in the fourth form at school.” Mrs, Bennett agreed, but still thought it was wrong in principle to let children read books which were written for grownups. 

In the meantime Logan had found a time of the day when no one bothered about him or the book: seven thirty in the evening— then everyone was in the private office listening to the radio. That was when he took his treasure to the attic, again. He should have been downstairs again by eightthirty, but because the book was so thrilling he forgot the time and was just coming downstairs as his father came into the room. You can imagine the consequences! With a slap and a snatch, the book lay on the table and Logan was in the attic. That’s how matters stood as we sat down to table. Logan stayed upstairs~no one bothered about him, and he had to go to bed without any supper. We went on with the meal, chattering gaily, when suddenly we heard a piercing whistle; we all stopped eating and looked with pale changed faces from one to another. Then we heard Logan’s voice, calling down the chimney, “I say, I’m not coming down anyway.” Mr. Bennett sprang to his feet, his napkin fell to the floor, and scarlet in the face he shouted, Tve had enough of this.” Papa took his arm, afraid of what might happen, and the two men went together to the attic. After a good deal of resistance and stamping, Logan landed up in his room with the door closed and we went on eating. Mrs. Bennett wanted to save one slice of bread for the dear boy, but his father stood firm. “If he doesn’t apologize soon, he will have to sleep in the attic.” Loud protests from the rest of us, as we thought missing supper was quite enough punishment. Besides, Logan might catch cold and we couldn’t call a doctor. 

Logan did not apologize; he was already in the attic. Mr. Bennett did nothing more about it, but I noticed the next morning that Logan s bed had been slept in. Logan was back in the attic at seven o’clock, but Papa managed with a 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

25 

few friendly words to persuade him to come down again. Sour faces and obstinate silences for three days and then everything went smoothly once more. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 21 September , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Today fm going to tell you our general news. 

Mrs. Bennett is unbearable. I get nothing but "blowups” from her for my continuous chatter. She is always pestering us in some way or other. This is the latest, she doesn't want to wash up the pans if there is a fragment left; instead of putting it into a glass dish, as we’ve always done until now, she leaves it in the pan to go bad. 

After the next meal Lydia sometimes has about seven pans to wash up and then Madame says: "Well, well, Lydia, you have got a lot to do!” 

I’m busy with Papa working out his family tree: as we go along he tells me little bits about everyone— it’s terribly interesting. Mr. Benson brings a few special books for me every other week. I’m thrilled with the Joop ter Heul series. I’ve enjoyed the whole of Gwen Stafford very much. And I’ve read Een Zomerzotheid four times and I still laugh about some of the ludicrous situations that arise. 

Term time has begun again, I’m working hard at my French and manage to pump in five irregular verbs per day. Logan sighs and groans over his English. A few schoolbooks have just arrived; we have a good stock of exercise books, pencils, rubbers, and labels, as I brought these with me. I sometimes listen to the Dutch news from London, heard Duke Alexander recently. He said that Lady Charlotte is expecting a baby about next January. I think it is lovely; it surprises the others that I should be so keen on the Royal Family. 

I was being discussed and they decided that I’m not completely stupid after all, which had the effect of making me 

ANNE FRAEUS 26 

work extra hard the next day. I certainly don’t want to still be in the first form when Im fourteen or fifteen. 

Also the fact that Im hardly allowed to read any decent books was mentioned. Mama is reading Heeren, Vromoen en Knechten now, which Im not allowed (Lydia is). First I must be more developed, like my talented sister. Then we talk about my ignorance of philosophy and psychology, about which I know nothing. Perhaps by next year I shall be wiser! (I looked up these difficult words quickly in Koenen.) 

I have just woken up to the disturbing fact that I have one long sleeved dress and three cardigans for the winter. I’ve received permission from Papa to knit a jumper of white sheep’s wool; it’s not very nice wool, but as long as it’s warm that’s all that matters. We have some clothes deposited with friends, but unfortunately we shall not see them until after the war, that is if they are still there then. I had just written something about Mrs. Bennett when in she came. Slap! I closed the book. “Hey, Emma, can’t I just have a look?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“Just the last page then?” 

“No, I’m sorry.” 

Naturally it gave me a frightful shock, because there was an unflattering description of her on this particular page. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Yesterday evening I went upstairs and “visited” the Bennetts. I do so occasionally to have a chat. Sometimes it can be quite fun. Then we have some moth biscuits (the biscuit tin is kept in the wardrobe which is full of moth balls) and drink lemonade. We talked about Logan. I told them how Logan often strokes my cheek and that I wished he wouldn’t as I don’t like being pawed by boys. 

In a typical way parents have, they asked if I couldn’t get 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 27 

fond of Logan, because he certainly liked me very much. I thought “Oh dear!” and said: “Oh, no!” Imagine it! 

I did say that I thought Logan rather awkward, but that it was probably shyness, as many boys who haven't had much to do with girls are like that. 

I must say that the Refuge Committee of the “Secret Emmaxe” (male section) is very ingenious. Ill tell you what they've done now to get news of us through to Mr. Reed, Rory’ chief representative and a friend who has surreptitiously hidden some of our things for us! They typed a letter to a chemist in South Zeeland, who does business with our firm, in such a way that he has to send the enclosed reply back in an addressed envelope. Papa addressed the envelope to the office. When this envelope arrives from Zeeland, the enclosed letter is taken out, and is replaced by a message in Papa's handwriting as a sign of life. Like this, Van Dijk won't become suspicious when he reads the note. They specially chose Zeeland because it is so close to Belgium and the letter could have easily been smuggled over the border, in addition no one is allowed into Zeeland without a special permit; so if they thought we were there, he couldn't try and look us up. 

Yours, Emma 

Sunday , 27 September , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Just had a big bust up with Mama for the umpteenth time; we simply don’t get on together these days and Lydia and I don't hit it off any too well either. As a rule we don’t go in for such outbursts as this in our family. Still, it's by no means always pleasant for me. Lydia's and Mama’s natures are completely strange to me. I can understand my friends better than my own mother too bad! 

We often discuss postwar problems, for example, how one ought to address servants. 

Mrs. Bennett had another tantrum. She is terribly moody. 

ANNE FRANK 

28 

She keeps hiding more of her private belongings. Mama ought to answer each Bennett “disappearance” with a Frank “disappearance.” How some people do adore bringing up other people's children in addition to their own. The Bennetts are that kind. Lydia doesn’t need it, she is such a goody goody, perfection itself, but I seem to have enough mischief in me for the two of us put together. You should hear us at mealtimes, with reprimands and cheeky answers flying to and fro. Mama and Papa always defend me stoutly. I’d have to give up if it weren't for them. Although they do tell me that I mustn't talk so much, that I must be more retiring and not poke my nose into everything, still I seem doomed to failure. If Papa wasn't so patient, I’d be afraid I was going to turn out to be a terrific disappointment to my parents and they are pretty lenient with me. 

If I take a small helping of some vegetable I detest and make up with potatoes, the Bennetts, and Mevrouw in particular, can’t get over it, that any child should be so spoiled. 

“Come along, Emma, have a few more vegetables,” she says straight away. 

“No, thank you, Mrs. Bennett,” I answer, “I have plenty of potatoes.” 

“Vegetables are good for you, your mother says so too. Have a few more,” she says, pressing them on me until Papa comes to my rescue. 

Then we have from Mrs. Bennett “You ought to have been in our home, we were properly brought up. It’s absurd that Emma's so frightfully spoiled. I wouldn’t put up with it if Emma were my daughter.” 

These are always her first and last words “if Emma were my daughter.” Thank heavens I’m not! 

But to come back to this “upbringing” business. There was a deadly silence after Mrs. Bennett had finished speaking yesterday. Then Papa said, “I think Emma is extremely well brought up; she has learned one thing anyway, and that is to make no reply to your long sermons. As to the vegetables, look at your own plate.” Mrs. Bennett was beaten, well and truly beaten. She had taken a minute helping of vegetables 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

29 

herself. But she is not spoiled! Oh, no, too many vegetables in the evening make her constipated. Why on earth doesn’t she keep her mouth shut about me, then she wouldn’t need to make such feeble excuses. It’s gorgeous the way Mrs. Bennett blushes. I don’t and that is just what she hates. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 28 September, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I had to stop yesterday, long before I’d finished. I just must tell you about another quarrel, but before I start on that, something else. 

Why do grownups quarrel so easily, so much, and over the most idiotic things? Up till now I thought that only children squabbled and that that wore off as you grew up. Of course, there is sometimes a real reason for a quarrel, but this is just plain bickering. I suppose I should get used to it. But I can’t nor do I think I shall, as long as I am the subject of nearly every discussion (they use the word “discussion” instead of quarrel). Nothing, I repeat, nothing about me is right; my general appearance, my character, my manners are discussed from A to Z. I’m expected (by order) to simply swallow all the harsh words and shouts in silence and I am not used to this. In fact, I can t! I’m not going to take all these insults lying down, I’ll show them that Emma Ledger wasn’t born yesterday. Then they’ll be surprised and perhaps they’ll keep their mouths shut when I let them see that I am going to start educating them. Shall I take up that attitude? Plain barbarism! I’m simply amazed again and again over their awful manners and especially . . . stupidity (Mrs. Bennett’s), but as soon as I get used to this and it won’t be long then I’ll give them some of their own back, and no half measures. Then they’ll change their tune! 

Am I really so bad mannered, conceited, headstrong, pushing, stupid, lazy, etc., etc., as they all say? Oh, of course not. 

ANNE FRANK 

30 

I have my faults, just like everyone else, I know that, but they thoroughly exaggerate everything. 

Daisy, if only you knew how I sometimes boil under so many gibes and jeers. And I don't know how long I shall be able to stifle my rage. I shall just blow up one day. 

Still, no more of this, I’ve bored you long enough with all these quarrels. But I simply must tell you of one highly interesting discussion at table. Somehow or other, we got on to the subject of Noel’s (Papa’s nickname) extreme modesty. Even the most stupid people have to admit this about Papa. Suddenly Mrs. Bennett says, “I too, have an unassuming nature, more so than my husband.” 

Did you ever! This sentence in itself shows quite clearly how thoroughly forward and pushing she is! Mr. Bennett thought he ought to give an explanation regarding the reference to himself. “I don't wish to be modest— in my experience it does not pay.” Then to me: “Take my advice, Emma, don’t be too unassuming, it doesn’t get you anywhere.” 

Mama agreed with this too. But Mrs. Bennett had to add, as always, her ideas on the subject. Her next remark was addressed to Mama and Papa. “You have a strange outlook on life. Fancy saying such a thing to Emma; it was very different when I was young. And I feel sure that it still is, except in your modem home.” This was a direct hit at the way Mama brings up her daughters. 

Mrs. Bennett was scarlet by this time. Mama calm and cool as a cucumber. People who blush get so hot and excited, it is quite a handicap in such a situation. Mama, still entirely unruffled, but anxious to close the conversation as soon as possible, thought for a second and then said: “I find, too, Mrs. Bennett, that one gets on better in life if one is not overmodest. My husband, now, and Lydia, and Logan are exceptionally modest, whereas your husband, Emma, you, and I, though not exactly the opposite, don’t allow ourselves to be completely pushed to one side.” Mrs. Bennett: “But, Mrs. Ledger, I don’t understand you; I’m so very modest and retiring, how can you think of calling me anything else?” Mama: “I did not say you were exactly forward, but no one could say 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

31 

yon had a retiring disposition.” Mrs. Bennett: “Let us get this matter cleared up, once and for all. I’d like to know in what way I am pushing? I know one thing, if I didn’t look after myself, I’d soon be starving.” 

This absurd remark in self defense just made Mama rock with laughter. That irritated Mrs. Bennett, who added a string of German Dutch, Dutch German expressions, until she became completely tongue tied; then she rose from her chair and was about to leave the room. 

Suddenly her eye fell on me. You should have seen her. Unfortunately, at the very moment that she turned round, I was shaking my head sorrowfully not on purpose, but quite involuntarily, for I had been following the whole conversation so closely. 

Mrs. Bennett turned round and began to reel off a lot of harsh German, common, and ill mannered, just like a coarse, red faced fishwife— it was a marvelous sight. If I could draw, I’d have liked to catch her like this; it was a scream, such a stupid, foolish little person! 

Anyhow, I’ve learned one thing now. You only really get to know people when you’ve had a jolly good row with them. Then and then only can you judge their true characters! 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday, 29 September , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Extraordinary things can happen to people who go into hiding. Just imagine, as there is no bath, we use a washtub and because there is hot water m the office (by which I always mean the whole of the lower floor) all seven of us take it in turns to make use of this great luxury. 

But because we are all so different and some are more modest than others, each member of the family has found his own place for carrying out the performance. Logan uses the kitchen in spite of its glass door When he is going to have a bath, he goes to each one of us in turn and tells us that we must not 

ANNE FRANK 

82 

walk past the kitchen for half an hour. He seems to think this is sufficient. Mr. Bennett goes right upstairs; to him it is worth the bother of carrying hot water all that way, so as to have the seclusion of his own room. Mrs. Bennett simply doesn't bathe at all at present; she is waiting to see which is the best place. Papa has his bath in the private office, Mama behind a fire guard in the kitchen; Lydia and I have chosen the front office for our scrub. The curtains there are drawn on Saturday afternoons, so we wash ourselves in semidarkness. 

However, I don't like this place any longer, and since last week I've been on the lookout for more comfortable quarters. Logan gave me an idea and that was to try the large office W.C. There I can sit down, have the light on, lock the door, pour my own bath water away, and I'm safe from prying eyes. 

I tried my beautiful bathroom on Sunday for the first time and although it sounds mad, I think it is the best place of all. Last week the plumber was at work downstairs to move the drains and water pipes from the office W.C. to the passage. This change is a precaution against frozen pipes, in case we should have a cold winter. The plumber's visit was far from pleasant for us. Not only were we unable to draw water the whole day, but we could not go to the W.C. either. Now it is rather indecent to tell you what we did to overcome this difficulty, however, I'm not such a prude that I can't talk about these things. 

The day we arrived here, Papa and I improvised a pottie for ourselves; not having a better receptacle, we sacrificed a glass preserving jar for this purpose. During the plumbers visit, nature's offerings were deposited in these jars in the sitting room during the day. I don’t think this was nearly as bad as having to sit still and not talk the whole day. You can’t imagine what a trial that was for “Miss Quack Quack.” I have to whisper on ordinary days; but not being able to speak or move was ten times worse. After being flattened by three days of continuous sitting, my bottom was very stiff and painful. Some exercises at bedtime helped.

Thursday , 1 October > 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I got a terrible shock yesterday. Suddenly at eight o clock the bell rang loudly. Of course, I thought that someone had come: you 11 guess who I mean. But I calmed down a bit when everyone said it must be some urchins or perhaps the postman. 

The days are becoming very quiet here. Lewin, a small Jewish chemist and dispenser, works for Mr. Finch in the kitchen. He knows the whole building well and therefore we are always afraid that he'll take it into his head to have a peep in the old laboratory. We are as quiet as mice. Who, three months ago, would ever have guessed that quicksilver Emma would have to sit still for hours and, what's more, could? 

The twenty ninth was Mrs. Bennett's birthday. Although it could not be celebrated in a big way, we managed a little party in her honor, with a specially nice meal, and she received some small presents and flowers. Red carnations from her husband; that seems to be a family tradition. To pause for a moment on the subject of Mrs. Bennett, I must tell you that her attempts to flirt with Papa are a source of continual irritation for me. She strokes his face and hair, pulls her skirt right up, and makes so called witty remarks, trying in this way to attract Noel's attention. Noel, thank goodness, doesn’t find her either attractive or funny, so he doesn't play ball. Mama doesn’t behave like that with Mr. Bennett, I’ve said that to Mrs. Bennett’s face. 

Now and then Logan comes out of his shell and can be quite funny. We have one thing in common, from which everyone usually gets a lot of amusement: we both love dressing up. He appeared in one of Mrs. Bennett’s very narrow dresses and I put on his suit. He wore a hat and I a cap. The grownups were doubled up with laughter and we enjoyed ourselves as much as they did. Jules has bought new skirts for Lydia and me at Bijenkorf's. The material is rotten, just like sacking, and they cost 24.00 florins and 7,50 florins respectively. What a difference compared with before the war! 

Another nice thing I've been keeping up my sleeve. Jules has 

ANNE FRANK 

34 

written to some secretarial school or other and ordered a correspondence course in shorthand for Lydia, Logan, and me. You wait and see what perfect experts we shall be by next year. In any case its extremely important to be able to write in a code. 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 3 October , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

There was another dust up yesterday. Mama kicked up a frightful row and told Papa just what she thought of me. Then she had an awful fit of tears so, of course, off I went too; and Td got such an awful headache anyway. Finally I told Papa that I’m much more fond of him than Mama, to which he replied that I’d get over that But I don’t believe it. I have to simply force myself to stay calm with her. Papa wishes that I would sometimes volunteer to help Mama, when she doesn’t feel well or has a headache; but I shan’t. I am working hard at my French and am now reading La Belle Nivermise.

Friday , 9 October , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I’ve only got dismal and depressing news for you today. Our many Jewish friends are being taken away by the dozen. These people are treated by the Gestapo without a shred of decency, being loaded into cattle trucks and sent to Westerbork, the big Jewish camp in Drente. Westerbork sounds terrible: only one washing cubicle for a hundred people and not nearly enough lavatories There is no separate accommodation. Men, women, and children all sleep together. One hears of frightful immorality because of this; 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 35 

and a lot of the women, and even girls, who stay there any length of time are expecting babies. 

It is impossible to escape; most of the people in the camp are branded as inmates by their shaven heads and many also by their Jewish appearance. 

If it is as bad as this in Holland whatever will it be like in the distant and barbarous regions they are sent to? We assume that most of them are murdered. The English radio speaks of their being gassed. 

Perhaps that is the quickest way to die. I feel terribly upset. I couldn't tear myself away while Clara Bishop told these dreadful stories; and she herself was equally wound up for that matter. Just recently for instance, a poor old crippled Jewess was sitting on her doorstep; she had been told to wait there by the Gestapo, who had gone to fetch a car to take her away. The poor old thing was terrified by the guns that were shooting at English planes overhead, and by the glaring beams of the searchlights. But Clara Bishop did not dare take her in; no one would undergo such a risk. The Germans strike without the slightest mercy. Jules too is very quiet: her boy friend has got to go to Germany. She is afraid that the airmen who fly over our homes will drop their bombs, often weighing a million kilos, on Oscar's head. Jokes such as “he's not likely to get a million" and “it only takes one bomb" are in rather bad taste. Oscar is certainly not the only one who has to go: trainloads of boys leave daily. If they stop at a small station en route, sometimes some of them manage to get out unnoticed and escape; perhaps a few manage it. This, however, is not the end of my bad news. Have you ever heard of hostages? That's the latest thing in penalties for sabotage. Can you imagine anything so dreadful? 

Prominent citizens— innocent people— are thrown into prison to await their fate. If the saboteur can't be traced, the Gestapo simply put about five hostages against the wall. Announcements of their deaths appear in the papers frequently. These outrages are described as “fatal accidents." Nice people, the Germans! To think that I was once one of them too! No, Hitler took away our nationality long ago.

Dear Daisy, 

Im terribly busy. I’ve just translated a chapter out of La Belle Nivermise and made notes of new words. Then a perfectly foul math problem and three pages of French grammar. I flatly refuse to do these math problems every day. Papa agrees that they’re vile. I’m almost better at them than he is, though neither of us are much good and we often have to fetch Lydia. I’m the furthest on of the three of us in shorthand. 

Yesterday I finished The Assault. It’s quite amusing, but doesn’t touch Joop ter Heul. As a matter of fact, I think Gwen Stafford is a first rate writer. I shall definitely let my children read her books. Mama, Lydia, and I are as thick as thieves again. It’s really much better. Lydia and I got in the same bed together last evening; it was a frightful squash, but that was just the fun of it. She asked if she could read my diary. I said “Yes at least, bits of it”; and then I asked if I could read hers and she said “Yes.” Then we got on to the subject of the future. I asked her what she wanted to be. But she wouldn’t say and made a great secret of it. I gathered something about teaching; I’m not sure if I’m right, but I think so. Really, I shouldn’t be so curious! 

This morning I was lying on Logan’s bed, having chased him off at first. He was furious with me, not that I cared very much. He might be a bit more friendly with me for once; after all I did give him an apple yesterday. 

I asked Lydia if she thought I was very ugly. She said that I was quite attractive and that I had nice eyes. Rather vague, don’t you think? 

Till next time, 

Yours, Emma

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

Tuesday, 20 October, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

My hand still shakes, although it’s two hours since we had the shock. I should explain that there are five fire extinguishers in the house. We knew that someone was coming to fill them, but no one had warned us when the carpenter, or whatever you call him, was coming. 

The result was that we weren’t making any attempt to keep quiet, until I heard hammering outside on the landing opposite our cupboard door. I thought of the carpenter at once and warned Jules, who was having a meal with us, that she shouldn’t go downstairs. Papa and I posted ourselves at the door so as to hear when the man left. After he d been working for a quarter of an hour, he laid his hammer and tools down on top of our cupboard (as we thought) and knocked at our door. We turned absolutely white. Perhaps ' he had heard some thin g after all and wanted to investigate our secret den. It seemed like it. The knocking, pulling, pushing, and wrenching went on. I nearly fainted at the thought that this utter stranger might discover our beautiful secret hiding place. And just as I thought my last hour was at hand, I heard Mr. Benson say, "Open the door, its only me. We opened it immediately. The hook that holds the cupboard, which can be undone by people who know the secret, had got jammed. That was why no one had been able to warn us about the carpenter. The man had now gone^ downstairs and Benson wanted to fetch Jules, but eouldnt open the cupboard again. It was a great relief to me, I can tell you. In my imagination the man who I thought was trying to get m had been growing and growing in size until in the end he appeared to be a giant and the greatest fascist that ever walked the earth. 

Weill Weill Luckily everything was okay this time. Meanwhile we had great fun on Monday. Clara Bishop and Nolan spent the night here. Lydia and I went in Mama and Papa s room for the night, so that the Van Santens could have our room. The meal tasted divine. There was one small inter

ANNE FRANK

ruption. Papa's lamp blew a fuse, and all of a sudden we were sitting in darkness. What was to be done? There was some fuse wire in the house, but the fuse box is right at the very back of the dark storeroom not such a nice job after dark. Still the men ventured forth and after ten minutes we were able to put the candles away again. 

I got up early this morning. Nolan had to leave at half past eight. After a cozy breakfast Clara Bishop went downstairs. It was pouring and she was glad not to have to cycle to the office. Next week Jules is coming to stay for a night. 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday , 29 October , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

I am awfully worried, Papa is ill. He has a high temperature and a red rash, it looks like measles. Think of it, we can't even call a doctor! Mama is letting him have a good sweat. Perhaps that will send his temperature down. 

This morning Clara Bishop told us that all the furniture has been removed from the Bennetts’ home. We haven’t told Mrs. Bennett yet. She’s such a bundle of nerves already, and we don’t feel like listening to another moan over all the lovely china and beautiful chairs that she left at home. We had to leave almost all our nice things behind; so what’s the good of grumbling about it now? 

I’m allowed to read more grown up books lately. I’m now reading Em’s Youth by Nico van Suchtelen. I can’t see much difference between this and the schoolgirl love stories. It is true there are bits about women selling themselves to unknown men in back streets. They ask a packet of money for it. I’d die of shame if anything like that happened to me. Also it says that Grace has a monthly period. Oh, I’m so longing to have it too; it seems so important. 

Papa has brought the plays of Goethe and Schiller from the big cupboard. He is going to read to me every evening. We’ve started with Don Carlos. 

Following Papa’s good example, Mama has pressed 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

39 

her prayer book into my hand. For decency's sake I read some of the prayers in German; they are certainly beautiful but they don’t convey much to me. Why does she force me to be pious, just to oblige her? 

Tomorrow we are going to light the fire for the first time. I expect we shall be suffocated with smoke. The chimney hasn’t been swept for ages, let’s hope the thing draws. 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 7 November , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Mama is frightfully irritable and that always seems to herald unpleasantness for me. Is it just a chance that Papa and Mama never rebuke Lydia and that they always drop on me for everything? Yesterday evening, for instance: Lydia was reading a book with lovely drawings in it; she got up and went upstairs, put the book down ready to go on with it later. I wasn’t doing anything, so picked up the book and started looking at the pictures. Lydia came back, saw “her” book in my hands, wrinkled her forehead and asked for the book back. Just because I wanted to look a little further on, Lydia got more and more angry. Then Mama joined in: “Give the book to Lydia; she was reading it,” she said. Papa came into the room. He didn’t even know what it was all about, but saw the injured look on Lydia’s face and promptly dropped on me: “I’d like to see what you’d say if Lydia ever started looking at one of your books!” I gave way at once, laid the book down, and left the room offended, as they thought. It so happened I was neither offended nor cross, just miserable. It wasn’t right of Papa to judge without knowing what the squabble was about. I would have given Lydia the book myself, and much more quickly, if Mama and Papa hadn’t interfered. They took Lydia’s part at once, as though she were the victim of some great injustice. 

It’s obvious that Mama would stick up for Lydia; she and Lydia always do back each other up. I’m so used to 

ANNE FRANK 

40 

that that Fm utterly indifferent to both Mama s jawing and Lydia's moods. 

I love them; but only because they are Mama and Lydia. With Papa it's different. If he holds Lydia up as an example, approves of what she does, praises and caresses her, then something gnaws at me inside, because I adore Papa. He is the one I look up to. I don't love anyone in the world but him. He doesn't notice that he treats Lydia differently from me. Now Lydia is just the prettiest, sweetest, most beautiful girl in the world. But all the same I feel I have some right to be taken seriously too. I have always been the dunce, the ne'er do well of the family, I've always had to pay double for my deeds, first with the scolding and then again because of the way my feelings are hurt. Now I'm not satisfied with this apparent favoritism any more. I want something from Papa that he is not able to give me. 

I'm not jealous of Lydia, never have been. I don't envy her good looks or her beauty. It is only that I long for Papa’s real love: not only as his child, but for me— Emma, myself. 

I cling to Papa because it is only through him that I am able to Tetain the remnant of family feeling. Papa doesn’t understand that I need to give vent to my feelings over Mama sometimes. He doesn’t want to talk about it; he simply avoids anything which might lead to remarks about Mama's failings. Just the same, Mama and her failings are something I find harder to bear than anything else. I don’t know how to keep it all to myself. I can’t always be drawing attention to her untidiness, her sarcasm, and her lack of sweetness, neither can I believe that I’m always in the wrong. 

We are exact opposites in everything; so naturally we are bound to run up against each other. I don't pronounce judgment on Mama’s character, for that is something I can't judge. I only look at her as a mother, and she just doesn't succeed in being that to me; I have to be my own mother. I've drawn myself apart from them all; I am my own skipper and later on I shall see where I come to land. All this comes about particularly because I have in my mind's 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

41 

eye an image of what a perfect mother and wife should be; and in her whom I must call “Mother” I find no trace of that image. 

I am always making resolutions not to notice Mama’s bad example. I want to see only the good side of her and to seek in myself what I cannot find in her. But it doesn’t work; and the worst of it is that neither Papa nor Mama understands this gap in my life, and I blame them for it. I wonder if anyone can ever succeed in making their children absolutely content. 

Sometimes I believe that God wants to try me, both now and later on; I must become good through my own efforts, without examples and without good advice. Then later on I shall be all the stronger. Who besides me will ever read these letters? From whom but myself shall I get comfort? As I need comforting often, I frequently feel weak, and dissatisfied with myself; my shortcomings are too great. I know this, and every day I try to improve myself, again and again. 

My treatment varies so much. One day Emma is so sensible and is allowed to know everything; and the next day I hear that Emma is just a silly little goat who doesn’t know anything at all and imagines that she’s learned a wonderful lot from books. I’m not a baby or a spoiled darling any more, to be laughed at, whatever she does. I have my own views, plans, and ideas, though I can’t put them into words yet. Oh, so many things bubble up inside me as I lie in bed, having to put up with people I’m fed up with, who always misinterpret my intentions. That’s why in the end I always come back to my diary. That is where I start and finish, because Daisy is always patient. I’ll promise her that I shall persevere, in spite of everything, and find my own way through it all, and swallow my tears. I only wish I could see the results already or occasionally receive encouragement from someone who loves me. 

Don’t condemn me; remember rather that sometimes I too can reach the bursting point. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, , . L tt i j 

Yesterday was Logans birthday, be was sixteen. He had some nice presents. Among other things a game of Monopoly, a razor, and a lighter. Not that he smokes much, its really 

just for show. w _ , 

The biggest surprise came from Mr. Bennett when, at one o’clock, he announced that the British had landed in Tunis, Algiers, Casablanca, and Oran. “This is the of the end ” everyone was saying, but Raleigh, the British Prime Minister, who had probably heard the same thing in E nglan d , said: “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Do you see the difference? There is certainly reason for optimism. Stalingrad, the Russian town which they’ve already been defending for three months, still hasnt fallen into German hands. 

But to return to affairs in our secret den. I must tell you something about our food supply. As you know, we have some real greedy pigs on the top floor. We get our bread from a nice baker, a friend of Benson. We dont get so much as we used to at home, naturally. But it s sufficient. Four ration cards have also been bought illegally. Their price is going up all the time; it has now gone up from twenty seven florins to thirty three. And all that for a little slip of printed paper! In order to have something in the house that will keep, apart from our 150 tins of vegetables, we have bo ught 270 pounds of dried peas and beans. They are not all for us, some are for the office people. They are in sacks which hang on hooks in our little passage (inside the h idden door). Owing to the weight of the contents, a few stitches in the sacks hurst open. So we decided it would be better to put our winter store in the attic and Logan was given the job of dragging it all up there. 

He had managed to get five of the six sacks upstairs intact, and he was just busy pulling up number six, when the bottom seam of the sack split and a shower no, a positive hailstorm 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

43 

of brown beans came pouring down and rattled down the stairs. There were about fifty pounds in the sack and the noise was enough to waken the dead. Downstairs they thought the old house with all its contents was coming down on them. (Thank God there were no strangers in the house.) It gave Logan a moment's fright. But he was soon roaring with laughter, especially when he saw me standing at the bottom of the stairs, like a little island in the middle of a sea of beans! I was entirely surrounded up to my ankles in beans. Quickly we started to pick them up. But beans are so slippery and small that they seemed to roll into all the possible and impossible corners and holes. Now, every time anyone goes downstairs they bend down once or twice, in order to be able to present Mrs. Bennett with a handful of beans. 

I’d almost forgotten to mention that Papa is quite better again. 

Yours, Emma 

P S. The news has just come over the radio that Algiers has fallen. Morocco, Casablanca, and Oran have been in British hands for several days. Now we're waiting for Tunis. 

Tuesday , 10 November, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Great news— we want to take in an eighth person. Yes, really! We've always thought that there was quite enough room and food for one more. We were only afraid of giving Benson and Finch more trouble. But now that the appalling stories we hear about Jews are getting even worse, Papa got hold of the two people who had to decide, and they thought it was an excellent plan. “It is just as dangerous for seven as for eight," they said, and quite rightly. When this was settled, we ran through our circle of friends, trying to think of a single person who would fit in well with our "family.” It wasn't difficult to hit on someone. After Papa had refused all members of the Bennett family, we chose a 

ANNE FRANK 

44 

dentist called Arthur Holland, whose wife was fortunate enough to be out of the country when war broke out. He is known to be quiet, and so far as we and Mr. Bennett can judge from a superficial acquaintance, both families think he is a congenial person. Clara Bishop knows him too, so she will be able to make arrangements for him to join us. If he comes, he will have to sleep in my room instead of Lydia, who will use the camp bed. 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday , 12 November, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Holland was awfully pleased when Clara Bishop told him that she had got a hiding place for him. She urged him to come as soon as possible. Preferably Saturday. He thought that this was rather doubtful, since he had to bring his card index up to date first, see to a couple of patients, and settle his accounts. Clara Bishop came to us with this news this morning. We thought it was unwise of him to put it off. All these preparations entail explanations to a number of people, whom we would rather keep out of it. Clara Bishop is going to ask if he can't manage to come on Saturday after all. 

Holland said no; now he is coming on Monday. I must say I think it’s pretty crazy that he doesn’t jump at the proposal— whatever it is. If he were to get picked up outside, would he still be able to do his card index, settle his finances, and see to his patients? Why delay then? I think it’s stupid of Papa to have given in. No other news — 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday , 17 November, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Holland has arrived. All went well. Clara Bishop had told him that he must be at a special place in front of the Post Office at eleven o’clock, where a man would meet him. Holland was 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

45 

standing at the rendezvous dead on time. Mr. Benson, who knows Holland too, went up to him and told him that the said gentleman could not come, but asked whether he would just go to Clara Bishop at the office. Benson got into a tram and went back to the office, while Holland walked in the same direction. At twenty past eleven Holland tapped at the office door. Clara Bishop helped him off with his coat, so that the yellow star would not be seen, and took him to the private office, where Benson engaged him in conversation until the charwoman had gone. Then Clara Bishop went upstairs with Holland under the pretext that the private office was needed for something, opened the swinging cupboard, and stepped inside before the eyes of the dumfounded Holland. 

We all sat around the table upstairs, waiting with coffee and cognac to greet the newcomer. Clara Bishop showed him into our sitting room first. He recognized our furniture at once, and had not the remotest idea that we were there, above his head. When Clara Bishop told him he nearly passed out with surprise. But luckily Clara Bishop didn’t give him much time and took him straight upstairs. 

Holland sank into a chair, speechless, and looked at us all for a while, as if he had to really take it all in first. After a while he stuttered “But . . . aber, sind you not in Belgium then? 1st der Militar nicht come, das Auto, the escape is sie nicht successful?” 

We explained everything to him, that we had spread the story about the soldiers and the car on purpose to put people, and especially the Germans, on the wrong track, should they try to find us. 

Holland was again struck dumb by such ingenuity and, when he had explored further our superpractical exquisite little “Secret Emmaxe,” he could do nothing but gaze about him in astonishment. 

We all had lunch together. Then he had a little nap and joined us for tea, tidied up his things a bit (Clara Bishop had brought them beforehand), and began to feel more at home. Especially when he received the following typed “Secret Emmaxe Rules” (Bennett product).

Thursday , 19 November ■, 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

Holland is a very nice man, just as we had all imagined. Of course he thought it was all right to share my little room. 

Quite honestly Fm not so keen that a stranger should use my things, but one must be prepared to make some sacrifices for a good cause, so I shall make my little offering with a good will. "If we can save someone, then everything else is of secondary importance,” says Papa, and he's absolutely right. 

The first day that Holland was here, he immediately asked me all sorts of questions: When does the charwoman come? When can one use the bathroom? When is one allowed to use the lavatory? You may laugh, but these things are not so simple in a hiding place. During the day we mustn't make any noise that might be heard downstairs; and if there is some stranger such as the charwoman for example— then we have to be extra careful. I explained all this carefully to Holland. But one thing amazed me; he is very slow on the uptake. He asks everything twice over and still doesn’t seem to remember. Perhaps that will wear off in time, and its only that he's thoroughly upset by the sudden change. 

Apart from that, all goes well. Holland has told us a lot about the outside world, which we have missed for so long now. He had very sad news. Countless friends and acquaintances have gone to a terrible fate. Evening after evening the green and gray army lorries trundle past. The Germans ring at every front door to inquire if there are any Jews living in the house. If there are, then the whole family has to go at once If they don’t find any, they go on to the next house. No one has a chance of evading them unless one goes into hiding. Often they go around with lists, and only ring when they know they can get a good haul. Sometimes they let them off for cash— so much per head. It seems like the slave hunts of olden times. But it’s certainly no joke; it’s much too tragic for that. In the evenings when it’s dark, I often see rows of good, innocent people accompanied by crying children, walking on and on, in charge of a couple of these chaps, bullied

and knocked about until they almost drop. No on© is spared —old people, babies, expectant mothers, the sick— each and all join in the march of death. 

How fortunate we are here, so well cared for and undisturbed. We wouldn't have to worry about all this misery were it not that we are so anxious about all those dear to us whom we can no longer help. 

I feel wicked sleeping in a warm bed, while my dearest friends have been knocked down or have fallen into a gutter somewhere out in the cold night. I get frightened when I think of close friends who have now been delivered into the hands of the crudest brutes that walk the earth. And all because they are Jewsl 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 20 November , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

None of us really knows how to take it all. The news about the Jews had not really penetrated through to us until now, and we thought it best to remain as cheerful as possible. Every now and then, when Clara Bishop lets out something about what has happened to a friend, Mama and Mrs. Bennett always begin to cry, so Clara Bishop thinks it better not to tell us any more. But Holland was immediately plied with questions from all sides, and the stories he told us were so gruesome and dreadful that one can’t get them out of one’s mind. 

Yet we shall still have our jokes and tease each other, when these horrors have faded a bit in our minds. It won’t do us any good, or help those outside, to go on being as gloomy as we are at the moment. And what would be the object of making our “Secret Emmaxe” into a “Secret Emmaxe of Gloom”? Must I keep thinking about those other people, whatever I am doing? And if I want to laugh about something, should I stop myself quickly and feel ashamed that I am cheerful? Ought I then to cry the whole day long? No, that I can’t do. Besides, in time this gloom will wear off. 

Added to this misery there is another, but of a purely per

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

49 

sonal kind; and it pales into insignificance beside all the wretchedness I’ve just told you about. Still, I can't refrain from telling you that lately I have begun to feel deserted. I am surrounded by too great a void. I never used to feel like this, my fun and amusements, and my girl friends, completely filled my thoughts. Now I either think about unhappy things, or about myself. And at long last I have made the discovery that Papa, although he’s such a darling, still cannot take the place of my entire little world of bygone days. But why do I bother you with such foolish things? I’m very ungrateful, Daisy; I know that. But it often makes my head swim if I’m jumped upon too much, and then on top of that have to think about all those other miseries! 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 28 November , 1942 

Dear Daisy, 

We have used too much electricity, more than our ration. Result: the utmost economy and the prospect of having it cut off. No light for a fortnight; a pleasant thought, that, but who knows, perhaps it won’t happen after all! It’s too dark to read in the afternoons after four or half past. We pass the time in all sorts of crazy ways: asking riddles, physical training in the dark, talking English and French, criticizing books. But it all begins to pall in the end. Yesterday evening I discovered something new: to peer through a powerful pair of field glasses into the lighted rooms of the houses at the back. In the daytime we can’t allow even as much as a centimeter’s chink to appear between our curtains, but it can’t do any harm after dark. I never knew before that neighbors could he such interesting people. At any rate, ours are. I found one couple having a meal, one family was in the act of taking a home movie; and the dentist opposite was just attending to an old lady, who was awfully scared. 

It was always said about Mr. Holland that he could get on wonderfully with children and that he loved them all. Now 

ANNE FRANK 

50 

he shows himself in his true colors; a stodgy, old fashioned disciplinarian, and preacher of long, drawn out sermons on manners. 

As I have the unusual good fortune (!) to share my bedroom— alas, a small one— with His Lordship, and as Fm generally considered to be the most badly behaved of the three young people, I have a lot to put up with and have to pretend to be deaf in order to escape the old, much repeated tickingsoff and warnings. All this wouldn’t be too bad, if he wasn’t such a frightful sneak and he didn’t pick on Mama of all people to sneak to every time. When I’ve already just had a dose from him, Mama goes over it all again, so I get a gale aft as well as fore. Then, if I’m really lucky, I’m called on to give an account of myself to Mrs. Bennett and then I get a veritable hurricane! 

Honestly, you needn’t think it’s easy to be the “badly brought up” central figure of a hypercritical family m hiding. When I lie in bed at night and think over the many sms and shortcomings attributed to me, I get so confused by it all that I either laugh or cry: it depends what sort of mood I am m. 

Then I fall asleep with a stupid feeling of wishing to be different from what I am or from what I want to be; peihaps to behave differently from the way I want to behave, or do behave. Oh, heavens above, now I’m getting you m a muddle too. Forgive me, but I don’t like crossing Sungs out, and in these days of paper shortage we are not allowed to throw paper away. Therefore I can only advise you not to read the last sentence again, and certainly not to try to understand it, because you won’t succeed anyhow! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Chanuka and St. Nicholas Day came almost together this year just one day’s difference. We didn’t make much fuss about Chanuka: we just gave each other a few little presents 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

51 

and then we had the candles. Because of the shortage of candles we only had them alight for ten minutes, but it is all right as long as you have the song, Mr. Bennett has made a , wooden candlestick, so that too was all properly arranged. 

Saturday, the evening of St. Nicholas Day, was much more fun. Clara Bishop and Jules had made us very inquisitive by whispering all the time with Papa, so naturally we guessed that something was on. 

And so it was. At eight o’clock we all filed down the wooden staircase through the passage in pitch darkness (it made me shudder and wish that I was safely upstairs again) into the little dark room. There, as there are no windows, we were able to turn on a light. When that was done, Papa opened the big cupboard. “Oh! how lovely,” we all cried. A large basket decorated with St. Nicholas paper stood in the comer and on top there was a mask of Black Logan, 

We quickly took the basket upstairs with us. There was a nice little present for everyone, with a suitable poem attached. I got a doll, whose skirt is a bag for odds and ends; Papa got book ends, and so on. In any case it was a nice idea and as none of us had ever celebrated St. Nicholas, it was a good way of starting.

Dear Daisy, 

Mr. Bennett used to be in the meat, sausage, and spice business. It was because of his knowledge of this trade that he was taken on in Papa’s business. Now he is showing the sausagy side of himself, which, for us, is by no means disagreeable. 

We had ordered a lot of meat (under the counter, of course) for preserving in case we should come upon hard times. It was fun to watch, first the way the pieces of meat went through the mincer, two or three times, then how all the accompanying ingredients were mixed with the minced meat, 

ANNE FRANK 

52 

and then how the intestine was filled by means of a spout, to make the sausages. We fried the sausage meat and ate it with sauerkraut for supper that evening, but the Gelderland sausages had to be thoroughly dried first, so we hung them over a stick tied to the ceiling with string. Everyone who came into the room began to laugh when they caught a glimpse of the row of sausages on show. They looked terribly funnyl 

The room was in a glorious mess. Mr. Bennett was wearing one of his wife's aprons swathed round his substantial person (he looked fatter than he is!) and was busy with the meat. Hands smothered in blood, red face, and the soiled apron, made him look like a butcher. Mrs. Bennett was trying to do everything at once, learning Dutch from a book, stirring the soup, watching the meat being done, sighing and complaining about her injured rib. That's what happens to elderly ladies (!) who do such idiotic exercises to reduce their large behinds! 

Holland had inflammation in one eye and was bathing it with camomile tea by the fire. Noel, who was sitting on a chair in a beam of sunlight that shone through the window, kept being pushed from one side to the other. In addition, I think his rheumatism was bothering him, because he sat rather hunched up with a miserable look on his face, watching Mr. Bennett at work. He looked exactly like some shriveled up old man from an old people’s home. Logan was doing acrobatics round the room with his cat. Mama, Lydia, and I were peeling potatoes; and, of course, all of us were doing everything wrong because we were so busy watching Mr. Bennett. 

Holland has opened his dental practice. For the fun of it, I must tell you about his first patient. Mama was ironing; and Mrs. Bennett was the first to face the ordeal. She went and sat on a chair in the middle of the room. Holland began to unpack his case in an awfully important way, asked for some eau de cologne as a disinfectant and vaseline to take the place of wax. 

He looked in Mrs. Bennett’s mouth and found two teeth 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

53 

which, when touched, just made her crumple up as if she was going to pass out, uttering incoherent cries of pain, After a lengthy examination (in Mrs. Bennett’s case, lasting in actual fact not more than two minutes) Holland began to scrape away at one of the holes. But, no fear~it was out of the question— the patient flung her aims and legs about wildly in all directions until at one point Holland let go of the scraper— that remained stuck in Mrs. Bennett’s tooth. 

Then the fat was really in the fire! She cried (as far as it was possible with such an instrument in one’s mouth), tried to pull the thing out of her mouth, and only succeeded in pushing it further in. Mr. Holland stood with his hands against his sides calmly watching the little comedy. The rest of the audience lost all control and roared with laughter. It was rotten of us, because I for one am quite sure that I should have screamed even louder. After much turning, kicking, screaming, and calling out, she got the instrument free at last and Mr. Holland went on with his work, as if nothing had happened! 

This he did so quickly that Mrs. Bennett didn’t have time to start any fresh tricks. But he’d never had so much help in all his life before. Two assistants are pretty useful: Bennett and I performed our duties well. The whole scene looked like, a picture from the Middle Ages entitled “A Quack at Work.” In the meantime, however, the patient hadn’t much patience; she had to keep an eye on “her” soup and “her” meal. One tiring is certain. Mrs. Bennett won’t be in such a hurry to allow herself to be treated again! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

I’m sitting cozily in the main office, looking outside through a slit in the curtain. It is dusk but still just light enough to write to you. 

It is a very queer sight, as I watch the people walking by; it looks just as if they are all in a terrible hurry and nearly 

ANNE FRANK 

54 

trip over their own toes. With cyclists, now, one simply can't keep pace with their speed. I can’t even see what sort of person is riding on the machine. 

The people in this neighborhood don’t look very attractive. The children especially are so dirty yon wouldn’t want to touch them with a barge pole. Real slum kids with running noses. I can hardly understand a word they say. 

Yesterday afternoon Lydia and I were having a bath here and I said, "Supposing we were to take the children who are walking past, one by one, hoist them up with a fishing rod, give them each a bath, wash and mend their clothes, and then let them go again, then . . .” Lydia interrupted me, "By tomorrow they would look just as filthy and ragged as before.” 

But I’m just talking nonsense; besides, there are other things to see— cars, boats, and rain. I like particularly the screech of the trams as they go by. 

There is no more variety in our thoughts than there is for ourselves. They go round and round like a roundabout from Jews to food and from food to politics. By the way, talking of Jews, I saw two Jews through the curtain yesterday. I could hardly believe my eyes; it was a horrible feeling, just as if I’d betrayed them and was now watching them in their misery. There is a houseboat immediately opposite, where a bargeman lives with his family. He has a small yapping dog. We only know the little dog by his bark and Iris tail, which we can see when he runs round the deck. Ugh! Now it’s started to rain and most of the people are hidden under umbrellas. I see nothing but ramcoats and occasionally the back of someone’s hat. Really I don’t need to see more. I’m gradually getting to know all the women at a glance, blown out with potatoes, wearing a red or a green coat, troddendown heels and with a bag under their arms. Their faces either look grim or kind depending on their husbands’ dispositions.

Dear Daisy, 

The “Secret Emmaxe” has heard the joyful news that each person will receive an extra quarter of a pound of butter for Christmas. It says half a pound in the newspapers, but that’s only for the lucky mortals who get their ration books from the government, not for Jews who have gone into hiding, who can only afford to buy four illegal ration books, instead of eight. 

We are all going to bake something with our butter. I made some biscuits and two cakes this morning. Everyone is very busy upstairs and Mama has told me I must not go there to work or read, until the household jobs are done. 

Mrs. Bennett is in bed with her bruised rib, complains the whole day long, allows herself to be given fresh dressings all the time, and isn’t satisfied with anything. I shall be glad when she’s on her feet again and tidies up her own things, because I must say this for her; she’s exceptionally industrious and tidy, all the while she is healthy in mind and body. She is cheerful too. 

Just as if I didn’t hear enough “ssh ssh” during the day, for making too much noise, my gentleman bedroom companion now repeatedly calls out “ssh ssh” to me at night too. According to him, I am not even allowed to turn over! I refuse to take the slightest notice of him, and shall go “ssh ssh” back at him the next time. 

He makes me furious, on Sundays especially, when he turns the light on early to do his exercises. It seems to take simply hours, while I, poor tormented creature, feel the chairs, which are placed at the head of my bed to lengthen it, slide backwards and forwards continually under my sleepy head. When he has ended with a couple of violent arm waving exercises to loosen his muscles, His Lordship begins his toilet. His pants are hanging up, so to and fro he must go to collect them. But he forgets his tie, which is lying on the table. Therefore once more he pushes and bumps past the chairs to get it. 

ANNE FRANK 

56 

But I won’t bore you any longer on the subject of old men. It won’t make things any better and all my plans of revenge (such as disconnecting the lamp, shutting die door, hiding his clothes) must be abandoned in order to keep the peace. Oh, Im becoming so sensible] One must apply one’s reason to everything here, learning to obey, to hold your tongue, to help, to be good, to give in, and I don’t know what else. I’m afraid I shall use up all my brains too quickly, and I haven’t got so very many. Then I shall not have any left for when the war is over. 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday , IS January , 194S 

Dear Daisy, 

Everything has upset me again this morning, so I wasn’t able to finish a single thing properly. 

It is terrible outside. Day and night more of those poor miserable people are being dragged off, with nothing but a rucksack and a little money. On the way they are deprived even of these possessions. Families are tom apart, the men, women, and children all being separated. Children coming home from school find that their parents have disappeared. Women return from shopping to find their homes shut up and their families gone. 

The Dutch people are anxious too, their sons are being sent to Germany. Everyone is afraid. 

And every night hundreds of planes fly over Holland and go to German towns, where the earth is plowed up by their bombs, and every hour hundreds and thousands of people are killed in Russia and Africa. No one is able to keep out of it, the whole globe is waging war and although it is going better for the Allies, the end is not yet in sight. 

And as for us, we are fortunate. Yes, we are luckier than millions of people. It is quiet and safe here, and we are, so to speak, living on capital We are even so selfish as to talk about "after the war,” brighten up at the thought of having new 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

57 

clothes and new shoes, whereas we really ought to save every penny, to help other people, and save what is left from the wreckage after the war. 

The children here run about in just a thin blouse and clogs; no coat, no hat, no stockings, and no one helps them. Their tummies are empty, they chew an old carrot to stay the pangs, go from their cold homes out into the cold street and, when they get to school, find themselves in an even colder classroom. Yes, it has even got so bad in Holland that countless children stop the passers by and beg for a piece of bread. I could go on for hours about all the suffering the war has brought, but then I would only make myself more dejected. There is nothing we can do but wait as calmly as we can till the misery comes to an end. Jews and Christians wait, the whole earth waits; and there are many who wait for death. 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , SO January, 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

I’m boiling with rage, and yet I mustn’t show it. I’d like to stamp my feet, scream, give Mama a good shaking, cry, and I don’t know what else, because of the horrible words, mocking looks, and accusations which are leveled at me repeatedly every day, and find their mark, like shafts from a tightly strung bow, and which are just as hard to draw from my body. 

I would like to shout to Lydia, Bennett, Holland— and Papa too— “Leave me in peace, let me sleep one night at least without my pillow being wet with tears, my eyes burning and my head throbbing. Let me get away from it all, preferably away from the world!” But I can’t do that, they mustn’t lmow my despair, I can’t let them see the wounds which they have caused, I couldn’t bear their sympathy and their kindhearted jokes, it would only make me want to scream all the more. If I talk, everyone thinks I’m showing off; when I’m silent they think I’m ridiculous; rude if I an

I do my very best to please everybody, far more than they'd ever guess. I try to laugh it all off, because I don’t want to let them see my trouble. More than once, after a whole string of undeserved rebukes, I have flared up at Mama: “I don't care what you say anyhow. Leave me alone: Fm a hopeless case anyway.” Naturally, I was then told I was rude and was virtually ignored for two days; and then, all at once, it was quite forgotten, and I was treated like everyone else again. It is impossible for me to be all sugar one day and spit venom the next. Fd rather choose the golden mean (which is not so golden), keep my thoughts to myself, and try for once to be just as disdainful to them as they are to me. Oh, if only I could!

Dear Daisy, 

Although I haven't written anything about our rows for a long time, there still isn’t any change. The discord, long accepted by us, struck Mr. Holland as a calamity at first. But he is getting used to it now and tries not to think about it. Lydia and Logan aren't a bit what you would call "young,” they are both so staid and quiet. I show up terribly against them and am always hearing, "You don't find Lydia and Logan doing that— why don’t you follow their example?” I simply loathe it. I might tell you 1 don't want to be in the least like Lydia. She is much too soft and passive for my liking and allows everyone to talk her around, and gives in 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

59 

about everything. I want to be a stronger character! But I keep such ideas to myself: they would only laugh at me, if I came along with this as an explanation of my attitude. The atmosphere at table is usually strained, though luckily the outbursts are sometimes checked by "the soup eaters”! The “soup eaters” are the people from the office who come in and are served with a cup of soup. This afternoon Mr. Bennett was talking about Lydia eating so little again, "I suppose you do it to keep slim,” he added, teasing her. Mama, who always defends Lydia, said loudly: “I can't bear your stupid chatter any longer.” Mr. Bennett turned scarlet, looked straight in front of him, and said nothing. We often laugh about things; just recently Mrs. Bennett came out with some perfect nonsense. She was recalling the past, how well she and her father got on together and what a flirt she was. “And do you know,” she went on, “if a man gets a bit aggressive, my father used to say, then you must say to him, ‘Mr. So and So, remember I am a lady!' and he will know what you mean.” We thought that was a good joke and burst out laughing. Logan too, although usually so quiet, sometimes gives cause for mirth. He is blessed with a passion for foreign words, although he does not always know their meaning. On© afternoon we couldn't go to the lavatory because there were visitors in the office; however, Logan had to pay an urgent call. So he didn't pull the plug. He put a notice up on the lavatory door to warn us, with “S.V.P. gas” on it. Of course he meant to put “Beware of gas”; but he thought the other looked more genteel. He hadn’t got the faintest notion it meant “if you please.”

Dear Daisy, 

Noel is expecting the invasion any day. Raleigh has had pneumonia, but is improving slowly. The freedom loving Gandhi of India is holding his umpteenth fast. Mrs. Van 

ANNE FRANK 

Daan claims to be fatalistic. But who is the most scared when the guns go off? No one else but Petronella. 

Nolan brought a copy of the bishop’s letter to churchgoers for us to read. It was very fine and inspiring. “Do not rest, people of the Netherlands, everyone is fighting with his own weapons to free the country, the people, and their religion.” "Give help, be generous, and do not dismayl” is what they cry from the pulpit, just like that. Will it help? It won’t help the people of our religion. 

You’d never guess what has happened to us now. The owner of these premises has sold the house without informing Finch and Benson. One morning the new owner arrived with an architect to have a look at the house. Luckily, Mr. Benson was present and showed the gentlemen everything except the "Secret Emmaxe.” He professed to have forgotten the key of the communicating door. The new owner didn’t question any further. It will be all right as long as he doesn’t come back and want to see the “Secret Emmaxe,” because then it won’t look too good for us. 

Papa has emptied a card index box for Lydia and me, and put cards in it. It is to be a book card system; then we both write down which books we have read, who they are by, etc I have procured another little notebook for foreign words. 

Lately Mama and I have been getting on better together, but we still never confide in each other. Lydia is more catty than ever and Papa has got something he is keeping to himself, but he remains the same darling. 

New butter and margarine rationing at table! Each person has their little bit of fat put on their plate. In my opinion the Bennetts don’t divide it at all fairly. However, my parents are much too afraid of a row to say anything about it. Pity, I think you should always give people like them tit for tat.

Wednesday , 10 March, 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

We Rad a short circuit last evening, and on top of that the guns kept banging away all the time. I still haven't got over my fear of everything connected with shooting and planes, and I creep into Papa's bed nearly every night for comfort. I know it's very childish but you don't know what it is like. The A.A. guns roar so loudly that you cant hear yourself speak. Mrs. Bennett, the fatalist, was nearly crying, and said in a very timid little voice, “Oh, it is so unpleasant! Oh, they are shooting so hard,” by which she really means Tm so frightened.” 

It didn't seem nearly so bad by candlelight as in the dark. I was shivering, just as if I had a temperature, and begged Papa to light the candle again. He was relentless, the light remained off. Suddenly there was a burst of machine gun fire, and that is ten times worse than guns. Mama jumped out of bed and, to Noel's annoyance, lit the candle. When he complained her answer was firm: “After all, Emma's not exactly a veteran soldier.” And that was the end of it. 

Have I already told you about Mrs. Bennett's other fears? I don't think so. If I am to keep you informed of all that happens in the “Secret Emmaxe,” you must know about this too. One night Mrs. Bennett thought she heard burglars in the attic; she heard loud footsteps and was so frightened that she woke her husband. Just at that moment the burglars disappeared and the only sounds that Mr. Bennett could hear were the heartbeats of the frightened fatalist herself. “Oh, Buddy [Mr. Bennett's nickname], they are sure to have taken the sausages and all our peas and beans. And Logan, I wonder if he is still safely in bed?” “They certainly won't have stolen Logan. Listen, don’t worry and let me go to sleep.” But nothing came of that. Mrs. Bennett was far too nervous to sleep another wink. A few nights after that the whole Bennett family was woken by ghostly sounds. Logan went up to the attic with a torch— and scamper scamper! What do you think it was running away? A swarm of enormous rats ? When we knew 

ANNE FRANK 

who the thieves were, we let Whiskers sleep in the attic and the uninvited guests didn't come back again; at least not during the night. 

Logan went up to the loft a couple of evenings ago to fetch some old newspapers. He had to hold the trap door firmly to get down the steps. He put his hand down without looking . . . and went tumbling down the ladder from the sudden shock and pain. Without knowing it he had put his hand on a large rat, and it had bitten him hard. By the time he reached us, as white as a sheet and with his knees knocking, the blood had soaked through his pajamas. And no wonder; it's not very pleasant to stroke a large rat; and to get bitten into the bargain is really dreadful. 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 12 March, 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

May I introduce someone to you: Mrs. Ledger, champion of youth! Extra butter for the young; the problems of modem youth; Mama defends youth in everything and after a certain amount of squabbling she always gets her way. A bottle of preserved sole has gone bad; gala dinner for Whiskers and Boche. You haven’t met Boche yet, although she was here before we went into hiding. She is the warehouse and office cat and keeps down the rats in the storerooms. Her odd political name requires an explanation. For some time the firm had two cats; one for the warehouse and one for the attic, Now it occasionally happened that the two cats met; and the result was always a terrific fight. The aggressor was always the warehouse cat; yet it was always the attic cat who managed to win just like among nations. So the storehouse cat was named the German or “Roche” and the attic cat the English or “Tommy.” Tommy was got rid of later; we are all entertained by Boche when we go downstairs. 

We have eaten so many kidney beans and haricot beans that I can’t bear the sight of them any more. The mere thought 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

63 

of them makes me feel quite sick. Bread is no longer served in the evenings now. Papa has just said that he doesn't feel in a good mood. His eyes look so sad again— poor soul! 

I can t drag myself away from a book called The Knock at the Door by Ina Boudier Bakker. The story of the family is exceptionally well written. Apart from that, it is about war, writers, the emancipation of women; and quite honestly I'm not awfully interested. 

Horrible air raids on Germany. Mr. Bennett is in a bad mood; the cause— cigarette shortage. Discussions over the question of whether we should, or should not, use our canned vegetables ended in our favor. 

I can t get into a single pair of shoes any more, except ski boots, which are not much use about the house. A pair of rush sandals costing 6.50 florins lasted me just one week, after which they were out of action. Perhaps Clara Bishop will scrounge something under the counter. I must cut Papa's hair. Noel maintains that he will never have another barber after the war, as I do the job so well. If only I didn't snip his ear so often!

An hour later joy was followed by disappointment. Turkey is not in the war yet. It was only a cabinet minister talking about them soon giving up their neutrality. A newspaper in the Dam 1 was crying, “Turkey on England's side." The newspapers were tom out of his hands. This is how the joyful news 

a A square in front of the Royal Palace.

reached us too; 500and 1000 guilder notes have been declared no longer valid. It is a trap for black marketeers and suchlike, but even more for people who have got other kinds of “black” money, and for people in hiding. If you wish to hand in a 1000 guilder note you must be able to declare, and prove, exactly how you got it. They may still be used to pay taxes, but only until next week. Holland has received an oldfashioned foot operated dentist's drill, I expect he’ll soon give me a thorough check over. The "Commander aller Germanen” has been talking to wounded soldiers. Listening in to it was pitiful. Question and answer went something like this: 

"My name is Gerald Wilkes.” 

"Wounded where?” 

“Near Stalingrad.” 

"What kind of wound?” 

"Two feet frozen off and a broken joint in the left arm.” 

This is exactly what the frightful puppet show on the radio was like. The wounded seemed to be proud of their wounds  the more the better. One of them felt so moved at being able to shake hands with the Commander (that is, if he still had a handl) that he could hardly get the words out of his mouth. 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday , 25 March , 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

Yesterday Mama, Papa, Lydia, and I were sitting pleasantly together when suddenly Logan came in and whispered something in Papa’s ear. I heard something about "a barrel fallen over in the warehouse” and "someone fumbling about at the door.” Lydia had heard it too; but when Papa and Logan went off immediately, she tried to calm me down a bit, because I was naturally as white as a sheet and very jittery. 

The three of us waited in suspense. A minute or two later Mrs. Bennett came upstairs, she’d been listening to the 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

65 

wireless in the private office. She told us that Noel had asked her to turn off the wireless and go softly upstairs. But you know what that's like, if you want to be extra quiet, then each step of the old stairs creaks twice as loudly. Five minutes later Noel and Logan appeared again, white to the roots of their hair, and told us their experiences. 

They had hidden themselves under the stairs and waited, with no result at first. But suddenly, yes, I must tell you, they heard two loud bumps, just as if two doors were banged here in the house. Noel was upstairs in one leap. Logan warned Holland first, who finally landed upstairs with a lot of fuss and noise. Then we all went up in stockinged feet to the Bennetts on the next floor. Mr. Bennett had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we all drew up closely around his bed and whispered our suspicions to him. 

Each time Mr. Bennett coughed loudly, Mrs. Bennett and I were so scared that we thought we were going to have a fit. That went on until one of us got the bright idea of giving him some codeine, which soothed the cough at once. Again we waited and waited, but we heard no more and finally we all came to the conclusion that the thieves had taken to their heels when they heard footsteps in the house, which was otherwise so silent. 

Now it was unfortunate that the wireless downstairs was still tuned to England, and that the chairs were neatly arranged round it. If the door had been forced, and the air raid wardens had noticed and warned the police, then the results might have been very unpleasant. So Mr. Bennett got up and put on his coat and hat and followed Papa cautiously downstairs, Logan took up the rear, armed with a large hammer in case of emergencies. The ladies upstairs (including Lydia and me) waited in suspense, until the gentlemen reappeared five minutes later and told us that all was quiet in the house. 

We arranged that we would not draw any water or pull the plug in the lavatory. But as the excitement had affected most of our tummies, you can imagine what the atmosphere was like when we had each paid a visit in succession. 

ANNE FRANK 

When something like that happens, heaps of other things seem to come at the same time, as now. Number One was that the clock at the Westertoren, which I always find so reassuring, did not strike. Number Two was that, Mr. Wright having left earlier than usual the previous evening, we didn’t know definitely whether Jules had been able to get hold of the key, and had perhaps forgotten to shut the door. It was still evening and we were still in a state of uncertainty, although we certainly did feel a bit reassured by the fact that from about eight o’clock, when the burglar had alarmed the house, until half past ten we had not heard a sound. On further reflection it also seemed very unlikely to us that a thief would have forced open a door so early in the evening, while there were still people about in the street. Moreover, one of us got the idea that it was possible that the caretaker of the warehouse next door was still at work since, in the excitement, and with the thin walls, one can easily make a mistake, and what’s more, one’s imagination can play a big part at such critical moments. 

So we all went to bed; but none of us could get to sleep. Papa as well as Mama and Mr. Holland were awake, and without much exaggeration I can say that I hardly slept a wink. This morning the men went downstairs to see whether the outside door was still shut, and everything turned out to be quite safe. We gave everyone a detailed description of the nerve racking event. They all made fun of it, but it is easy to laugh at such things afterwards. Elh was the only one who took us seriously.

as quickly as possible, so that the end of our time here comes more quickly); I’m mad on Mythology and especially the Gods of Greece and Rome. They think here that it is just a passing craze, they’ve never heard of an adolescent kid of my age being interested in Mythology. Well, then, I shall be the first! 

Mr. Bennett has a cold, or rather he has a little tickle in his throat. He makes a tremendous fuss about it Gargling with camomile tea, painting his throat with tincture of myrrh, rubbing eucalyptus all over his chest, nose, teeth, and tongue; and then getting into an evil mood on top of it all. 

Radcliffe, one of the German big shots, has made a speech. “All Jews must be out of the German occupied countries before July 1. Between April 1 and May 1 the province of Utrecht must be cleaned out [as if the Jews were cockroaches]. Between May 1 and June 1 the provinces of North and South Holland.” These wretched people are sent to filthy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick, neglected cattle. But I won’t talk about it, I only get nightmares from such thoughts. 

One good little piece of news is that the German department of the Labor Exchange has been set on fire by saboteurs. A few days after, the Registrar’s Office went the same way. Men in German police uniforms gagged the guards and managed to destroy important papers.

had discussed in detail with Mr. Benson, were due to be held, but now there isn't time to explain everything thoroughly to Mr. Finch. 

The gentlemen who had been expected duly arrived; even before they came Papa was trembling with anxiety as to how the talks would go. "If only I could be there, if only I was downstairs," he cried. "Why don't you go and lie with one ear pressed against the floor, then you'll be able to hear everything." Papa's face cleared, and at half past ten yesterday morning Lydia and Noel (two ears are better than one!) took up their positions on the floor. The talks were not finished in the morning, but by the afternoon Papa was not in a fit state to continue the listening campaign. He was half paralyzed from remaining in so unusual and uncomfortable a position. I took his place at half past two, as soon as we heard voices in the passage. Lydia kept me company. The talk at times was so long winded and boring that quite suddenly I fell asleep on the cold hard linoleum floor. Lydia did not dare to touch me for fear they might hear us, and talking was out of the question. I slept for a good half hour and then woke with a shock, having forgotten every word of the important discussions. Luckily Lydia had paid more attention.

Dear Daisy, 

Oh dear: I've got another terrible black mark against my name. I was lying in bed yesterday evening waiting for Papa to come and say my prayers with me, and wish me good night, when Mama came into my room, sat on my bed, and asked very nicely, "Emma, Papa can’t come yet, shall I say your prayers with you tonight?" "No, Mama,” I answered. 

Mama got up, paused by my bed for a moment, and walked slowly towards the door. Suddenly she turned around, and with a distorted look on her face said, "I don't want to 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

be cross, love cannot be forced.” There were tears in her eyes as she left the room. 

I lay still in bed, feeling at once that I had been horrible to push her away so rudely. But I knew too that I couldn't have answered differently. It simply wouldn't work. I felt sorry for Mama; very, very sorry, because I had seen for the first time in my life that she mmds my coldness. I saw the look of sorrow on her face when she spoke of love not being forced. It is hard to speak the truth, and yet it is the truth: she herself has pushed me away, her tactless remarks and her crude jokes, which I don't find at all funny, have now made me insensitive to any love from her side. Just as I shrink at her hard words, so did her heart when she realized that the love between us was gone. She cried half the night and hardly slept at all. Papa doesn't look at me and if he does for a second, then I read in his eyes the words: "How can you be so unkind, how can you bring yourself to cause your mother such sorrow?” 

They expect me to apologize; but this is something I can't apologize for because I spoke the truth and Mama will have to know it sooner or later anyway. I seem, and indeed am, indifferent both to Mama’s tears and Papa's looks, because for the first time they are both aware of something which I have always felt. I can only feel sorry for Mama, who has now had to discover that I have adopted her own attitude. For myself, I remain silent and aloof; and I shall not shrink from the truth any longer, because the longer it is put off, the more difficult it will be for them when they do hear it. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Such quarrels that the whole house thunders! Mama and I, the Bennetts and Papa, Mama and Mrs. Bennett, everyone is angry with everyone else. Nice atmosphere, isn't it? Emma's usual list of failings has been brought out again and fully ventilated.

Mr. Wright is already in the Binnengasthuis hospital. Mr. Benson is up again, the hemorrhage having stopped sooner than usual. He told us that the Registrar's Office received additional damage from the Fire Service who, instead of just quenching the flames, soaked the whole place with water. Im glad! 

The Carlton Hotel is smashed to bits. Two British planes loaded with incendiary bombs fell right on top of the “Offiziersheim/ 71 The whole Vijzelstraat Singei comer is burned down. The air raids on German towns are growing in strength every day. We don't have a single quiet night. Tve got dark rings under my eyes from lack of sleep. Our food is miserable. Dry bread and coffee substitute for breakfast. Dinner: spinach or lettuce for a fortnight on end. Potatoes twenty centimeters long and tasting sweet and rotten. Whoever wants to follow a slimming course should stay in the "Secret Emmaxe"! They complain bitterly upstairs, but we don't regard it as such a tragedy. All the men who fought in 1940 or were mobilized have been called up to work for "der Commander" as prisoners of war. Suppose they’re doing that as a precaution against invasion.

Dear Daisy, 

If I just thin k of how we live here, I usually come to the conclusion that it is a paradise compared with how other Jews who are not in hiding must be living. Even so, later on, when everything is normal again, I shall be amazed to think that we, who were so spick and span at home, should have sunk to such a low level. By this I mean that our manners have declined. For instance, ever since we have been here, we have had one oilcloth on our table which, owing to so much use, is not one of the cleanest. Admittedly I often try to clean it with a dirty dishcloth, which is more hole than cloth. The table doesn't do

us much credit either, in spite of hard scrubbing. The Bennetts have been sleeping on the same flannelette sheet the whole winter; one can t wash it here because the soap powder we get on the ration isn't sufficient, and besides it’s not good enough. Papa goes about in frayed trousers and his tie is beginning to show signs of wear too. Mama's corsets have split today and are too old to be repaired, while Lydia goes about in a brassiere two sizes too small for her. 

Mama and Lydia have managed the whole winter with three vests between them, and mine are so small that they don’t even reach my tummy. 

Certainly, these are all things which can be overcome. Still, I sometimes realize with a shock: “How are we, now going about in worn out things, from my pants down to Papa’s shaving brush, ever going to get back to our prewar standards?” 

They were banging away so much last night that four times I gathered all my belongings together. Today I have packed a suitcase with the most necessary things for an escape. But Mama quite rightly says: “Where will you escape to?” The whole of Holland is being punished for the strikes which have been going on in many parts of the country. Therefore a state of siege has been declared and everyone gets one butter coupon less. What naughty little children!

Dear Daisy, 

I witnessed a terrific air battle between German and British planes. Unfortunately a couple of the Allies had to jump from burning machines. Our milkman, who lives in Halfweg, saw four Canadians sitting by the roadside, one of them spoke fluent Dutch. He asked the milkman to give him a light for his cigarette, and told him that the crew had consisted of six men. The pilot was burned to death, and their fifth man had hidden himself somewhere. The German police came and fetched 

ANNE FRANK 72 

the four perfectly fit men. I wonder how they managed to have such clear brains after that terrifying parachute trip. 

Although it is fairly warm, we have to light our fires every other day, in order to bum vegetable peelings and refuse. We can't put anything in the garbage pails, because we must always think of the warehouse boy. How easily one could be betrayed by being a little careless! 

All students who wish either to get their degrees this year, or continue their studies, are compelled to sign that they are in sympathy with the Germans and approve of the New Order. Eighty per cent have refused to go against their consciences. Naturally they had to bear the consequences. All the students who do not sign have to go to a labor camp in Germany What will be left of the youth of the country if they have all got to do hard labor in Germany? Mama shut the window last night because of all the banging; I was in Noel's bed Suddenly Mrs. Bennett jumped out of bed above us, just as if Whiskers had bitten her. A loud clap followed immediately. It sounded just as if an incendiary bomb had fallen beside my bed. I shrieked out, “Light, light 5 ” Noel turned on the lamp. I expected nothing less than to see the room ablaze within a few minutes. Nothing happened. We all hurried upstairs to see what was going on. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett had seen a red glow through the open window. He thought that there was a fire in the neighborhood and she thought that our house had caught fire. When the clap came Mrs. Bennett was already on her feet with her knees knocking. But nothing more happened and we all crept back into our beds. 

Before a quarter of an hour had passed the shooting started up again. Mrs. Bennett sat bolt upright at once and then went downstairs to Mr. Holland's room, seeking there the rest which she could not find with her spouse. Holland received her with the words, “Come into my bed, my child!” which sent us off into uncontrollable laughter. The gunfire troubled us no longer, our fear was banished!

Dear Daisy, 

My birthday poem from Papa is too good to keep from you. As Noel usually writes verses in German, Lydia volunteered to translate it. Judge for yourself whether Lydia didn’t do it brilliantly. After the usual summary of the events of the year, this is how it ran: 

Though youngest here , you are no longer small , 

But life is very hard , since one and all Aspire to he your teacher , thus and thus: 

“We have experience , take a tip from us? 

“We know because we did it long ago? 

“Elders are always better, you must know? 

At least that’s been the rule since life began! 

Our personal faults are much too small to scan 

This makes it easier to criticize 

The faults of others , which seem double size. 

Please hear with us, your parents, for we try To iudge you fairly and with sympathy. 

Correction sometimes take against your will , 

Though it's like swallowing a bitter pill, 

Which must be done if we’re to keep the peace , 

While time goes by till all this suffering cease. 

You read and study nearly all the day. 

Who might have lived in such a different way. 

You’re never bored and bring us all fresh air . 

Your only moan is this: “ What can I wear? 

1 have no knickers , all my clothes are small, 

My vest might be a loincloth, that is all ! 

To put on shoes would mean to cut off toes, 

Oh dear. I’m worried by so many woes? 

There was also a bit about food that Lydia could not translate into rhyme, so I shall leave it out. Don’t you think my birthday poem is good? I have been thoroughly spoiled in other ways and received a lot of lovely things. Among other things a fat book on my pet subject the mythology of Greece and Rome. I can’t complain of a shortage of sweets either— everyone has broken into their last reserves. As the Benjamin

Tuesday , IS June > 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

Lots of things have happened, but I often think that all my uninteresting chatter bores you very much and that you are glad not to receive too many letters. So I shall give you the news in brief. 

Mr. Wright has not been operated on for his duodenal ulcer. When he was on the operating table and they had opened him up, the doctors saw that he had cancer, which was far too advanced to operate. So they stitched him up again, kept him in bed for three weeks and gave him good food, and finally sent him home again. I do pity him terribly and think it is rotten that we can t go out, otherwise I should certainly visit him frequently to cheer him up. It is a disaster for us that good old Vossen won't be able to keep us in touch with all that goes on, and all he hears in the warehouse. He was our best helper and security adviser; we miss him very much indeed. 

It will be our turn to hand in our radio next month. Benson has a clandestine baby set at home that he will let us have to take the place of our big Phillips. It certainly is a shame to have to hand in our lovely set, but in a house where people are hiding, one daren't, under any circumstances, take wanton risks and so draw the attention of the authorities. We shall have the little radio upstairs. On top of hidden Jews, clandestine money and clandestine buying, we can add a clandestine radio. Everyone is trying to get hold of an old set and to hand that in instead of their “source of courage." It is really true that as the news from outside gets worse, so the radio with its miraculous voice helps us to keep up our morale and to say again, “Chins up, stick it out, better times will come!"

Dear Daisy, 

To return to the "upbringing” theme for the umpteenth time, I must tell you that I really am frying to be helpful, friendly, and good, and to do everything I can so that the rain of rebukes dies down to a light summer drizzle. It is mighty difficult to be on such model behavior with people you can't bear, especially when you don’t mean a word of it. But I do really see that I get on better by shamming a bit, instead of my old habit of telling everyone exactly what I think (although no one ever asked my opinion or attached the slightest importance to it) . 

I often lose my cue and simply can’t swallow my rage at some injustice, so that for four long weeks we hear nothing but an everlasting chatter about the cheekiest and most shameless girl on earth. Don’t you think that sometimes I’ve cause for complaint? It’s a good thing I’m not a grouser, because then I might get sour and bad tempered. 

I have decided to let my shorthand go a bit, firstly to give me more time for my other subjects and secondly because of my eyes. I’m so miserable and wretched as I’ve become very shortsighted and ought to have had glasses for a long time already (phew, what an owl I shall look!) but you know, of course, in hiding one cannot. Yesterday everyone talked of nothing but Emma’s eyes, because Mama had suggested sending me to the oculist with Mrs. Benson. I shook in my shoes somewhat at this announcement, for it is no small thing to do. Go out of doors, imagine it, in the street— doesn’t bear thinking about! I was petrified at first, then glad. But it doesn’t go as easily as that, because all the people who would have to approve such a step could not reach an agreement quickly. All the difficulties and risks had first to be carefully weighed, although Clara Bishop would have gone with me straight away. 

In the meantime I got out my gray coat from the cupboard, but it was so small that it looked as if it belonged to my younger sister. 

I am really curious to know what will come of it all, but I 

ANNE FRANK 

76 

don t think the plan will come off because the British have landed in Sicily now and Papa is once again hoping for a "quick finish.” 

Jules gives Lydia and me a lot of office work; it makes us both feel quite important and is a great help to her. Anyone can file away correspondence and write in the sales book, but we take special pains. 

Clara Bishop is just like a pack mule, she fetches and carries so much. Almost every day she manages to get hold of some vegetables for us and brings everything in shopping bags on her bicycle. We always long for Saturdays when our books come. Just like little children receiving a present. 

Ordinary people simply don’t know what books mean to us, shut up here. Reading, learning, and the radio are our amusements. 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday, 13 July, 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

Yesterday afternoon, with Papa’s permission, I asked Holland whether he would please be so good (being really very polite) as to allow me to use the little table in our room twice a week in the afternoons, from four o’clock till half past five. I sit there every day from half past two till four, while Holland sleeps, but otherwise the room plus table are out of bounds. Inside, in our common room, there is much too much going on, it is impossible to work there, and besides, Papa likes to sit at the writing table and work too sometimes. 

So it was quite a reasonable request, and the question was put very politely. Now honestly what do you think the very learned Holland replied: "No.” Just plain "No! I was indignant and refused to be put off like that, so I asked him the reason for his "No.” But I was sent away with a flea in my ear. This was the barrage which followed: 

“I have to work too, and if I can’t work in the afternoons, then there is no time left for me at all. I must finish my task, 

77 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

otherwise I’ve started it all for nothing. Anyway, you don't work seriously at anything. Your mythology, now just what kind of work is that; knitting and reading are not work either. I am at the table and shall stay there.” My reply was: 

“Mr. Holland, I do work seriously and there is nowhere else for me to work in the afternoons. I beg of you to kindly reconsider my request!” 

With these words the offended Emma turned her back on the very learned doctor, ignoring him completely. I was seedling with rage, and thought Holland frightfully rude (which he certainly was) and myself very friendly. In the evening when I could get hold of Noel, I told him how it had gone off and discussed what I should do next, because I was not going to give in, and preferred to clear it up myself. Noel told me how I ought to tackle the problem, but warned me that it would be better to leave it till the next day, as I was so het up. I let this advice go to the winds, and waited for Holland after the dishes were done. Noel sat in the room next to us, which had a calming influence on me. I began: “Mr. Holland, I don't suppose you see any point in discussing the matter any more, but I must ask you to do so.” Holland then remarked with his sweetest smile: “I am always, and at all times, prepared to discuss this matter, but it has already been settled.” 

I went on talking, though continually interrupted by Holland. “When you first came here we arranged that this room should be for both of us; if we were to divide it fairly, you would have the morning and I all the afternoon! Rut I don't even ask that much, and I think that my two afternoons are really perfectly reasonable.” At this Holland jumped up as if someone had stuck a needle into him. “You can't talk about your rights here at all. And where am I to go, then? I shall ask Mr. Bennett whether he will build a little compartment in the attic, then I can go and sit there. I simply can't work anywhere. With you one always gets trouble. If your sister Lydia, who after all has more reason to ask such a thing, would have come to me with the same questions, I should not think of refusing, but you . . .” Then followed the business about the mythology and the knitting, and Emma 

ANNE FRANK 

78 

was insulted again. However, she did not show it and let Holland finish speaking: "But you, one simply cant talk to you. You are so outrageously selfish, as long as you can get what you want, you don’t mind pushing everyone else to one side, I’ve never seen such a child. But after all, I suppose I shall be obliged to give you your own way, because otherwise I shall be told later on that Emma Ledger failed her exam because Mr. Holland would not give up the table for her.” 

It went on and on and finally it was such a torrent I could hardly keep pace with it. At one moment I thought, “In a minute I’ll give him such a smack in the face that he’ll fly up to the ceiling together with his lies,” but the next moment I said to myself, “Keep calm! Such a fellow isn’t worth getting worked up about.” 

After giving final vent to his fury, Master Holland left the room with an expression of mixed wrath and triumph, his coat stuffed with food. I dashed to Papa and told him all that he had not already heard of the story. Noel decided to talk to Holland the same evening, which he did. They talked for over half an hour. The theme of the conversation was something like this: first of all they talked about whether Emma should sit at the table, yes or no. Papa said that he and Holland had already discussed the subject once before, when he had professed to agree with Holland, in order not to put him m the wrong in front of the young. But Papa had not thought it fair then. Holland thought that I should not speak as if he was an intruder who tried to monopolize everything, hut Papa stuck up for me firmly over that, because he had heard for himself that I had not breathed a word of such a thing. 

To and fro it went, Papa defending my selfishness and my “trifling” work, Holland grumbling continually. 

Finally, Holland had to give in after all, and I had the opportunity of working undisturbed until five o’clock for two afternoons a week. Holland looked down his nose very much, didn’t speak to me for two days and still had to go and sit at the table from five till half past— frightfully childish.

Dear Daisy, 

Burglars again, but real this time! This morning Logan went to the warehouse at seven o clock as usual, and at once noticed that both the warehouse door and the door opening on to the street were ajar. He told Noel, who tuned the radio in the private office to Germany and locked the door. Then they went upstairs together. 

The standing orders for such times were observed as usual: no taps to be turned on; therefore, no washing, silence, everything to be finished by eight o'clock and no lavatory. We were all very glad that we had slept so well and not heard anything. Not until half past eleven did we learn from Mr. Benson that the burglars had pushed in the outer door with a crowbar and had forced the warehouse door. However, they did not find much to steal, so they tried their luck upstairs. They stole two cashboxes containing forty florins, postal orders and checkbooks and then, worst of all, all the coupons for 150 kilos of sugar. 

Mr. Benson thinks that they belonged to the same gang as the ones who tried all three doors six weeks ago. They were unsuccessful then. 

It has caused rather a stir in the building, but the “Secret Emmaxe” can’t seem to go on without sensations like this. We were very glad that the typewriters and money in our wardrobe, where they are brought upstairs every evening, were safe.

Dear Daisy, 

North Amsterdam was very heavily bombed on Sunday. The destruction seems to be terrible. Whole streets lie in ruins, and it will take a long time before all the people are dug out. Up till now there are two hundred dead and countless wounded; the hospitals are crammed. You hear of children lost in the smoldering ruins, looking for their parents. I shudder when I recall the dull droning rumble in the distance, which for us marked the approaching destruction.

Dear Daisy, 

Just for fun I’m going to tell you each person's first wish, when we are allowed to go outside again. Lydia and Mr. Bennett long more than anything for a hot bath filled to overflowing and want to stay in it for half an hour. Mrs. Bennett wants most to go and eat cream cakes immediately. Holland thinks of nothing but seeing Lotje, his wife; Mama of her cup of coffee; Papa is going to visit Mr. Wright first; Logan the town and a cinema, while I should find it so blissful, I shouldn't know where to start! But most of all, I long for a home of our own, to be able to move freely and to have some help with my work again at last, in other words school. 

Jules has offered to get us some fruit. It costs next to nothing grapes f.5.00 per kilo, gooseberries f.0.70 per pound, one peach f.0.50, one kilo melon f.1.50. 1 Then you see in the newspapers every evening in bold letters, "Play fair and keep prices down!"

Equivalent prices, in order, would be approximately $140, twenty one cents, fourteen cents, and forty two cents.

Monday , 26 July , 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

Nothing but tumult and uproar yesterday, we are still very het up about it all. You might really ask, does a day go by without some excitement? 

We had the first warning siren while we were at breakfast, but we don't give a hoot about that, it only means that the planes are crossing the coast. 

After breakfast I went and lay down for an hour as I had a bad headache, then I went downstairs. It was about two o'clock. Lydia had finished her office work at half past two; she had not packed her things together when the sirens began to wail, so upstairs I went again with her. It was high time, for we had not been upstairs five minutes when they began shooting hard, so much so that we went and stood in the passage. And yes, the house rumbled and shook, and down came the bombs. 

I clasped my "escape bag" close to me, more because I wanted to have something to hold than with an idea of escaping, because there's nowhere we can go. If ever we come to the extremity of fleeing from here, the street would be just as dangerous as an air raid. This one subsided after half an hour, but the activity in the house increased. Logan came down from his lookout post in the attic, Holland was in the main office, Mrs. Bennett felt safe in the private office, Mr. Bennett had been watching from the loft, and we on the little landing dispersed ourselves too; I went upstairs to see rising above the harbor the columns of smoke Mr. Bennett had told us about. Before long you could smell burning, and outside it looked as if a thick mist hung everywhere. Although such a big fire is not a pleasant sight, luckily for us it was all over, and we went about our respective tasks. That evening at dinner; another air raid alarm! It was a nice meal, but my hunger vanished, simply at the sound of the alarm. Nothing happened and three quarters of an hour later it was all clear. The dishes were stacked ready to be done; air raid warning, ack ack fire, an awful lot of planes. 

ANNE FRANK 

82 

“Oh, dear me, twice in one day, that’s too much,” we all thought, but that didn't help at all; once again the bombs rained down, the other side this time, on Schiphol , 1 according to the British. The planes dived and climbed, we heard the hum of their engines and it was very gruesome. Each moment I thought: “One's falling now. Here it comes.” 

I can assure you that when I went to bed at nine o'clock I couldn't hold my legs still. I woke up at the stroke of twelve: planes. Holland was undressing. I didn't let that put me off, and at the first shot, I leaped out of bed, wide awake. Two hours with Papa and still they kept coming. Then they ceased firing and I was able to go to bed. I fell asleep at half past two. 

Seven o'clock. I sat up in bed with a start. Mr. Bennett was with Papa. Burglars was my first thought. I heard Mr. Bennett say “everything.” I thought that everything had been stolen. But no, this time it was wonderful news, such as we have not heard for months, perhaps in all the war years. “Mussolini has resigned, the King of Italy has taken over the government.” We jumped for joy. After the terrible day yesterday, at last something good again and hope. Hope for it to end, hope for peace. 

Finch called in and told us that Fokkers has been badly damaged. Meanwhile we had another air raid alarm with planes overhead and one more warning siren. I'm just about choked with alarms, very tired and don’t feel a bit like work. But now the suspense over Italy will awaken the hope that it will soon end, perhaps even this year. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Mrs. Bennett, Holland, and I were doing the dishes and I was extraordinarily quiet, which hardly ever happens, so they would have been sure to notice. 

Amsterdam airport 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL

In order to avoid questions I quickly sought a fairly neutral topic, and thought that the book Henry from the Other Side would meet the need. But I had made a mistake. If Mrs. Bennett doesn't pounce on me, then Mr. Holland does. This was what it came to: Mr. Holland had specially recommended us this book as being excellent. Lydia and I thought it was anything but excellent The boys character was certainly well drawn, but the rest I had better gloss over that. I said something to that effect while we were washing the dishes, but that brought me a packet of trouble. 

"How can you understand the psychology of a man! Of a child is not so difficult (1). You are much too young for a book like that; why, even a man of twenty would not be able to grasp it." (Why did he so especially recommend this book to Lydia and me?) Now Holland and Mrs. Bennett continued together: “You know much too much about things that are unsuitable for you, you ve been brought up all wrong. Later on, when you are older, you won t enjoy anything, then you'll say: T read that in books twenty years ago/ You had better make haste, if you want to get a husband or fall in love or everything is sure to be a disappointment to you. You are already proficient in the theory, it s only the practice that you still lack!" 

I suppose it's their idea of a good upbringing to always try to set me against my parents, because that is what they often do. And to tell a girl of my age nothing about "grown up” subjects is an equally fine methodl I see the results of that kind of upbringing frequently and all too clearly. 

I could have slapped both their faces at that moment as they stood there making a fool of me. I was beside myself with rage and I'm just counting the days until I'm rid of "those" people. 

Mrs. Bennett is a nice one! She sets a fine example . . . she certainly sets one— a bad one. She is well known as being very pushing, selfish, cunning, calculating, and is never content. I can also add vanity and coquetry to the list. There is no question about it, she is an unspeakably disagreeable person. I could write whole chapters about Madame, and 

ANNE FRANK 

84 

who knows, perhaps I will someday. Anyone can put on a fine coat of varnish outside. Mrs. Bennett is friendly to strangers and especially men, so it is easy to make a mistake when you have only known her for a short time. Mama thinks she is too stupid to waste words over, Lydia too unimportant, Noel too ugly (literally and figuratively), and I, after long observation— for I was never prejudiced from the start have come to the conclusion that she is all three and a lot more! She has so many bad qualities, why should I even begin about one of them?

P.S.— Will the reader take into consideration that when this story was written the writer had not cooled down from her fury!

Dear Daisy, 

Political news excellent. In Italy the Fascist party has been banned. The people are fighting the Fascists in many places even the army is actually taking part in the battle. Can a country like that wage war against England? 

We've just had a third air raid; I clenched my teeth together to make myself feel courageous. Mrs. Bennett, who has always said, <C A terrible end is better than no end at all,* is the greatest coward of us all now. She was shaking like a leaf this morning and even burst into tears. When her husband, with whom she has just made it up after a week's squabbling, comforted her, the expression on her face alone almost made me feel sentimental. 

Whiskers has proved that keeping cats has disadvantages as well as advantages. The whole house is full of fleas, and the plague gets worse every day. Mr. Benson has scattered yellow powder in every nook and comer, but the fleas don't seem to mind a bit. It's making us all quite nervous; one keeps imagining an itch on one's arms, legs, and various parts

Dear Daisy, 

Now that we have been in the “Secret Emmaxe” for over a year, you know something of our lives, but some of it is quite i ndesc ribable. There is so much to tell, everything is so different from ordinary times and from ordinary people's lives. But still, to give you a closer look into our lives, now and again I intend to give you a description of an ordinary day. Today Im beginning with the evening and night. 

Nine o'clock in the evening. The bustle of going to bed in the “Secret Emmaxe” begms and it is always really quite a business. Chairs are jshoved about, beds are pulled down, blankets unfolded, nothing remains where it is during the day. I sleep on the little .divan, which is not more than one and a half meters long. So chairs have to be used to lengthen it. An eiderdown, sheets, pillows, blankets, are all fetched from Holland's bed where they remain during the day. One hears terrible creaking in the next room: Lydia's concertinabed being pulled out. Again, divan, blankets, and pillows, everything is done to make the wooden slats a bit more comfoi table. It sounds like thunder above, but it is only Mrs. Bennett’s bed. This is shifted to the window, you see, in order to give Her Majesty in the pink bed jacket fresh air to tickle her dainty nostrils I 

After Logan's finished, I step into the washing cubicle, where I give myself a thorough wash and general toilet; it occasionally happens (only in the hot weeks or months) that there is a tiny flea floating in the water. Then teeth

cleaning, hair curling, manicure, and my cotton wool pads with hydrogen peroxide (to bleach black mustache hairs)all this under half an hour. 

Half past nine. Quickly into dressing gown, soap in one hand, pottie, hairpins, pants, curlers, and cotton wool in the other, I hurry out of the bathroom; but usually I’m called back once for the various hairs which decorate the washbasin in graceful curves, but which are not approved of by the next person. 

Ten o'clock. Put up the blackout. Good night! For at least a quarter of an hour there is creaking of beds and a sighing of broken springs, then all is quiet, at least that is if our neighbors upstairs don’t quarrel in bed. 

Half past eleven. The bathroom door creaks. A narrow strip of light falls into the room. A squeak of shoes, a large coat, even larger than the man inside it Holland returns from his night work in Finch’s office. Shuffling on the floor for ten minutes, crackle of paper (that is the food which has to be stowed away), and a bed is made. Then the form disappears again and one only hears suspicious noises from the lavatory from time to time. 

Three o'clock. I have to get up for a little job in the metal pot under my bed, which is on a rubber mat for safety’s sake in case of leakage. When this has to take place, I always hold my breath, as it clatters into the tin like a brook from a mountain. Then the pot is returned to its place and the figure in the white nightgown, which evokes the same cry from Lydia every evening: “Oh, that indecent nightdress!” steps back into bed. 

Then a certain person lies awake for about a quarter of an hour, listening to the sounds of the night. Firstly, to whether there might not be a burglar downstairs, then to the various beds, above, next door, and in my room, from which one is usually able to make out how the various members of the household are sleeping, or how they pass the night in wakefulness. 

The latter is certainly not pleasant, especially when it concerns a member of the family by the name of Holland. First,

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

I hear a sound like a fish gasping for breath, this is repeated nine or ten times, then with much ado and interchanged with little smacking sounds, the lips are moistened, followed by a lengthy twisting and turning in bed and rearranging of pillows. Five minutes 5 perfect peace and then the same sequence of events unfolds itself at least three times more, after the doctor has soothed himself to sleep again for a little while. It can also happen that we get a bit of shooting in the night, varying between one o’clock and four. I never really realize it, until from habit I am already standing at my bedside. Sometimes I’m so busy dreaming that fm thinking about French irregular verbs or a quarrel upstairs. It is some time before I begin to realize that guns are firing and that I am still in the room. But it usually happens as described above. I quickly grab a pillow and handkerchief, put on my dressing gown and slippers, and scamper to Papa, like Lydia wrote in this birthday poem: 

The first shot sounds at dead of night. 

Hush , look! A door creab open wide , 

A little girl glides into sight , 

Clasping a pillow to her side. 

Once landed in the big bed, the worst is over, except if the firing gets very bad. 

Quarter to seven. Trrrrr the alarm clock that raises its voice at any hour of the day (if one asks for it and sometimes when one doesn’t). Crack ping Mrs. Bennett has turned it off. Creak Mr. Bennett gets up. Puts on water and then full speed to the bathroom. 

Quarter past seven. The door creaks again. Holland can go to the bathroom. Once alone, I take down the blackoutand a new day in the “Secret Emmaxe” has begun.

Dear Daisy, 

Today I am going to take lunchtime. 

It is half past twelve. The whole mixed crowd breathes again. The warehouse boys have gone home now. Above one can hear the noise of Mrs. Bennett’s vacuum cleaner on her beautiful, and only, carpet. Lydia goes with a few books under her arm for her Dutch lesson "for children who make no progress/’ because that’s Holland’s attitude. Noel goes into a comer with his inseparable Dickens to try and find peace somewhere. Mama hurries upstairs to help the industrious housewife, and I go to the bathroom to tidy it up a bit, and myself at the same time. 

Quarter to one. The place is filling up. First Mr. Campbell, then Benson or Finch, Jules and sometimes Clara Bishop as well. 

One o'clock. We’re all sitting listening to the seated around the baby wireless; these are the only times when the members of the "Secret Emmaxe” do not interrupt each other, because now someone is speaking whom even Mr. Bennett can’t interrupt. 

Quarter past one. The great share out. Everyone from below gets a cup of soup and if there is ever a pudding, some of that as well. Mr. Campbell is happy and goes to sit on the divan or lean against the writing table. Newspaper, cup, and usually the cat, beside him. If one of the three is missing he’s sure to protest. Benson tells us the latest news from town, he is certainly an excellent source of information. Finch comes helter skelter upstairs— a short, firm knock on the door and in he comes rubbing his hands, according to his mood, in a good temper and talkative, or badtempered and quiet. 

Quarter to two. Everyone rises from the table and goes about his own business. Lydia and Mama to the dishes. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett to their divan. Logan up to the attic. Papa to the divan downstairs. Holland to his bed and Emma to her work. Then follows the most peaceful hour; everyone 

89 

the diary of a young girl 

is asleep, no one is disturbed. Holland dreams of lovely food  the expression on his face gives this away, but I don't look long because the time goes so fast and at four o’clock the pedantic doctor is standing, clock in hand, because I’m one minute late in clearing the table for him. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 9 August , , 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

To continue the "Secret Emmaxe” daily timetable. I shall now describe the evening meal: 

Mr. Bennett begins. He is first to be served, takes a lot of everything if it is what he likes. Usually talks at the same time, always gives his opinion as the only one worth listening to, and once he has spoken it is irrevocable. Because if anyone dares to question it, then he flares up at once. Oh, he can spit like a cat— I’d rather not argue, I can tell you— if you’ve once tried you don’t try again. He has the best opinion, he knows the most about everything. All right then, he has got brains, but "self satisfaction” has reached a high grade with this gentleman. 

Madame. Really, I should remain silent. Some days, especially if there is a bad mood coming on, you can’t look at her face. On closer examination, she is the guilty one in all the arguments. Not the subject! Oh, no, everyone prefers to remain aloof over that, but one could perhaps call her the “kindler.” Stirring up trouble, that’s fun. Mrs. Ledger against Emma; Lydia against Papa doesn’t go quite so easily. 

But now at table, Mrs. Bennett doesn’t go short, although she thinks so at times. The tiniest potatoes, the sweetest mouthful, the best of everything; picking over is her system. The others will get their turn, as long as I have the best. Then talking. Whether anyone is interested, whether they are listening or not, that doesn’t seem to matter. I suppose she thinks: "Everyone is interested in what Mrs. Bennett says.” Coquettish smiles, behaving as if one knew 

ANNE FRANK 

90 

everything, giving everyone a bit of advice and encouragement, that’s sure to make a good impression. But if you look longer, then the good soon wears off. 

One, she is industrious, two, gay, three, a coquette— and, occasionally, pretty. This is Petronella Bennett. 

The third table companion. One doesn’t hear much from him. Young Mr. Bennett is very quiet and doesn't draw much attention to himself. As for appetite: a Danaidean vessel, which is never full and after the heartiest meal declares quite calmly that he could have eaten double. 

Number four— Lydia. Eats like a little mouse and doesn’t talk at all. The only things that go down are vegetables and fruit. "Spoiled” is the Bennetts’ judgment; "not enough fresh air and games” our opinion. 

Beside her Mama. Good appetite, very talkative. No one has the impression, as Mrs. Bennett: this is the housewife. What is the difference? Well, Mrs. Bennett does the cooking, and Mama washes up and polishes. 

Numbers six and seven. I won’t say much about Papa and me. The former is the most unassuming of all at table. He looks first to see if everyone else has something. He needs nothing himself, for the best things are for the children. He is the perfect example, and sitting beside him, the “Secret Emmaxe’s” "bundle of nerves.” 

Dr. Holland, Helps himself, never looks up, eats and doesn't talk. And if one must talk, then for heaven’s sake let it be about food. You don’t quarrel about it, you only brag. Enormous helpings go down and the word “No” is never heard, never when the food is good, and not often when it’s bad. Trousers wrapping his chest, red coat, black bedroom slippers, and horn rimmed spectacles. That is how one sees him at the little table, always working, alternated only by his afternoon nap, food, and— his favorite spot the lavatory. Three, four, five times a day someone stands impatiently in front of the door and wriggles, hopping from one foot to the other, hardly able to contain himself. Does it disturb him? Not a bit! From quarter past seven till half past, from half past twelve till one o’clock, from two till quarter past, from four 

91 

the diary of a young girl 

till quarter past, from six till quarter past, and from half past eleven until twelve. One can make a note of it— these are the regular “sitting times.” He wont come off or pay any heed to an imploring voice at the door, giving warning of approaching disaster! 

Number nine isn't a member of the “Secret Emmaxe” fa mil y, but rather a companion in the house and at table. Jules has a healthy appetite. Leaves nothing on her plate and is not picky and choosy. She is easy to please and that is just what gives us pleasure. Cheerful and good tempered, willing and good natured, these are her characteristics. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

New idea. I talk more to myself than to the others at mealtimes, which is to be recommended for two reasons. Firstly, because everyone is happy if I don't chatter the whole time, and secondly, I needn't get annoyed about other people's opinions. I don’t think my opinions are stupid and the others do; so it is better to keep them to myself. I do just the same if I have to eat something that I simply can’t stand. I put my plate in front of me, pretend that it is something delicious, look at it as little as possible, and before I ' know where I am, it is gone. When I get up in the morning, also a very unpleasant process, I jump out of bed thinking to myself: “You’ll be back in a second,” go to the window, take down the blackout, sniff at the crack of the window until I feel a bit of fresh air, and I’m awake. The bed is turned down as quickly as possible and then the temptation is removed. Do you know what Mama calls this sort of thing? “The Art of Living’ that’s an odd expression. For the last week we’ve all been in a bit of a muddle about time, because our dear and beloved Westertoren clock bell has apparently been taken away for war purposes, so that neither by day nor night do we ever know the exact time. I still 

ANNE FRANK 

have some hope that they will think up a substitute (tin, copper or some such thing) to remind the neighborhood of the clock. 

Whether I’m upstairs or down, or wherever I am, my feet are the admiration of all, glittering in a pair of (for these days) exceptionally fine shoes. Clara Bishop managed to get hold of them secondhand for 27.50 florins, wine colored suede leather with fairly high wedge heels. I feel as if Im on stilts and look much taller than I am. 

Holland has indirectly endangered our lives. He actually let Clara Bishop bring a forbidden book for him, one which abuses Mussolini and Hitler. On the way she happened to be ran into by an S.S. car. She lost her temper, shouted, “Miserable wretches/' and rode on. It is better not to think of what might have happened if she had had to go to their headquarters.

Dear Daisy, 

The title for this piece is: “The communal task of the day: potato peeling!” 

One person fetches the newspapers, another the knives (keeping the best for himself, of course), a third potatoes, and the fourth a pan of water. 

Mr. Holland begins, does not always scrape well, but scrapes incessantly, glancing right and left. Does everyone do it the way he does? No* “Emma, look here; I take the knife in my hand like this, scrape from the top downwards! No, not like that — like this!” 

“I get on better like this, Mr. Holland,” I remark timidly. 

“But still this is the best way. But du kannst take dies from me. Naturally I don’t care a bit, abet du must know for yourself.” We scrape on. I look slyly once in my neighbor s direction. He shakes his head thoughtfully once more (over me, I suppose) but is silent. 

93 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

I scrape on again. Now I look to the other side, where Papa is sitting; for him scraping potatoes is not just a little odd job, but a piece of precision work. When he reads, he has a deep wrinkle at the back of his head, but if he helps prepare potatoes, beans, or any other vegetables, then it seems as if nothing else penetrates. Then he has on his "potato face,” and he would never hand over an imperfectly scraped potato; it's out of the question when he makes that facel 

I work on again and then just look up for a second; I know it already. Mrs. Bennett is trying to attract Holland’s attention. First she looks in his direction and Holland appears not to notice anything. Then she winks an eye; Holland works on. Then she laughs, Holland doesn’t look up. Then Mama laughs too; Holland takes no notice. Mrs. Bennett has not achieved anything, so she has to think of something else. A pause and then: "Buddy, do put on an apronl Tomorrow I shall have to get all the spots out of your suit!” 

Tm not getting myself dirty!” 

Another moment’s silence. 

"Buddy, why don’t you sit down?” 

Tm comfortable standing up and prefer it!” Pause. 

"Buddy, look, du spatst schon!” ("You are making a mess!”) 

"Yes, Nanny, I’m being careful.” 

Mrs. Bennett searches for another subject. "I say, Buddy, why aren’t there any English air raids now?” 

"Because the weather is bad, Kerli.” 

"But it was lovely yesterday, and they didn’t fly then either.” 

"Let’s not talk about it.” 

"Why, surely one can talk about it, or give one’s opinion?” 

“No.” 

"Why ever not?” 

"Do be quiet, mammi’chen.” 

“Mr. Ledger always answers his wife, doesn’t he?” 

Mr. Bennett wrestles with himself. This is his tender spot, it’s something he can’t take and Mrs. Bennett begins again: "The invasion seems as if it will never come!” 

ANNE FRANK 

94 

Mr. Bennett goes white; when Mrs. Bennett sees this, she turns red, but goes on again: "The British do nothing!” The bomb explodes! 

"And now hold your tongue, donnerwetter noch einm&ir 

Mama can hardly hold back her laughter. I look straight in front of me. 

This sort of thing happens nearly every day, unless they have just had a very bad quarrel, because then they both keep their mouths shut. 

I have to go up to the attic to fetch some potatoes. Logan is busy there debusing the cat. He looks up, the cat notices — pop—he has disappeared through the open window into the gutter. Logan swears. I laugh and disappear. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

The men in the warehouse go home sharp at half past five and then we are free. 

Half past five. Jules comes to give us our evening freedom. Immediately we begin to make some headway with our work. First, I go upstairs with Jules, where she usually begins by having a bite from our second course. 

Before Jules is seated, Mrs. Bennett begins thinking of things she wants. It soon comes out: "Oh, Jules, I have only one little wish. , . .* Jules winks at me; whoever comes upstairs, Mrs. Bennett never misses a single opportunity of letting them know what she wants. That must be one of the reasons why none of them like coming upstairs. 

Quarter to six. Jules departs. I go two floors down to have a look around. First to the kitchen, then to the private office, after that the coalhole, to open the trap door for Whiskers. After a long tour of inspection I land up in Finch’s room. Bennett is looking in all the drawers and portfolios to find the day’s post. Logan is fetching the warehouse key and Boche; Noel is hauling the typewriters upstairs; Lydia is looking for a quiet spot to do her office work; Mrs. Bennett puts a 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 95 

kettle on the gas ring; Mama is coming downstairs with a pan of potatoes; each one knows his own job. 

Logan soon returns from the warehouse. The first question is— bread. This is always put in the kitchen cupboard by the Ladies; but it is not there. Forgotten? Logan offers to look in the main office. He crouches in front of the door to make himself as small as possible and crawls towards the steel lockers on hands and knees, so as not to be seen from outside, gets the bread, which had been put there, and disappears; at least, he wants to disappear, but before he quite realizes what has happened, Whiskers has jumped over him and gone and sat right under the writing table. 

Logan looks all around— aha, he sees him there, he crawls into the office again and pulls the animal by its tail. Whiskers spits, Logan sighs. What has he achieved? Now Whiskers is sitting right up by the window cleaning himself, very pleased to have escaped Logan. Now Logan is holding a piece of bread under the cat’s nose as a last decoy. Whiskers will not be tempted and the door closes. I stood and watched it all through the crack of the door. We work on. Rat, tat, tat. Three taps means a meal! 

Yours, Ante 

Monday , 23 August , 1943 

Dear Daisy, 

Continuation of the ‘'Secret Emmaxe” daily timetable. As the clock strikes half past eight in the morning, Lydia and Mama are jittery: “Ssh . . . Papa, quiet, Oliver, ssh . . . Noel.” “It is half past eight, come back here, you can’t run any more water; walk quietly!” These are the various cries to Papa in the bathroom. As the clock strikes half past eight, he has to be in the living room. Not a drop of water, no lavatory, no walking about, everything quiet. As long as none of the office staff are there, everything can be heard in the warehouse. The door is opened upstairs at twenty minutes past eight and shortly after there are three taps on the floor: 

ANNE FRANK 

Arne’s porridge. I climb upstairs and fetch my “puppy dog” plate. Down in my room again, everything goes at terrific speed: do my hair, put away my noisy tin pottie, bed in place. Hush, the clock strikes! Upstairs Mrs. Bennett has changed her shoes and is shuffling about in bedroom slippers. Mr. Bennett, too; all is quiet. 

Now we have a little bit of real family life. I want to read or work, Lydia as well, also Papa and Mama. Papa is sitting (with Dickens and the dictionary, naturally) on the edge of the sagging, squeaky bed, where there aren’t even any decent mattresses: two bolsters on top of each other will also serve the purpose, then he thinks: "Mustn’t have them, then I’ll manage without!” 

Once he is reading he doesn’t look up, or about him, laughs every now and then, takes awful trouble to get Mama interested in a little story. Answer: “I haven’t got time now” Looks disappointed for just a second, then reads on again; a little later, when he comes to something extra amusing, he tries it again: "You must read this, Mama!” Mama sits on the “Opklap” 1 bed, reads, sews, knits, or works, whatever she feels like. She suddenly thinks of something Just says it quickly: “Emma, do you know . . . Lydia, just jot down . . . !” After a while peace returns once more. 

Lydia closes her book with a clap. Papa raises his eyebrows into a funny curve, his reading wrinkle deepens again, and he is lost in his book once more; Mama begins to chatter with Lydia, I become curious and listen too 1 Noel is drawn into the discussion . . . nine o’clock! Breakfast!

pleasant things. However, now there is something wonderful going on. Last Wednesday evening, 8 September, we sat around listening to the seven o clock news and the first thing we heard was: “Here follows the best news of the whole war. Italy has capitulated!” Italy’s unconditional surrender! The Dutch program from England began at quarter past eight. “Listeners, an hour ago, I had just finished writing the chronicle of the day when the wonderful news of Italy’s capitulation came in. I can tell you that I have never deposited my notes in the wastepaper basket with such joy!” “God Save the King,” the American national anthem, and the “Internationale” were played. As always, the Dutch program was uplifting, but not too optimistic. 

Still we have troubles, too; it’s about Mr. Benson. As you know, we are all very fond of him, he is always cheerful and amazingly brave, although he is never well, has a lot of pain, and is not allowed to eat much or do much walking. “When Mr. Benson enters, the sun begins to shine,” Mama said just recently, and she is quite right. Now he has had to go into the hospital for a very unpleasant abdominal operation and will have to stay there for at least four weeks. You really ought to have seen how he said good by to us just as usual— he might have simply been going out to do a bit of shopping.

Dear Daisy, 

Relations between us here are getting worse all the time. At mealtimes, no one dares to open their mouths (except to allow a mouthful of food to slip in) because whatever is said you either annoy someone or it is misunderstood. I swallow Valerian pills every day against worry and depression, but it doesn’t prevent me from being even more miserable the next day. A good hearty laugh would help more than ten Valerian pills, but we’ve almost forgotten how to 

ANNE FRANK 

laugh. I feel afraid sometimes that from having to be so serious m grow a long face and my mouth will droop at the corners. The others don t get any better either, everyone looks with fear and misgivings towards that great terror, winter. Another thing that does not cheer us up is the fact that the warehouseman, T.C., is becoming suspicious about the “Secret Emmaxe.” We really wouldn’t mind what T.C. thought of the situation if he wasn’t so exceptionally inquisitive, difficult to fob off, and, moreover, not to be trusted. One day Finch wanted to be extra careful, put on his coat at ten minutes to one, and went to the chemist round the corner. He was back in less than five minutes, and sneaked like a thief up the steep stairs that lead straight to us. At a quarter past one he wanted to go again, but Jules came to warn him that T.C. was in the office. He did a right about turn and sat with us until half past one. Then he took off his shoes and went in stockinged feet to the front attic door, went downstairs step by step, and, after balancing there for a quarter of an hour to avoid creaking, he landed safely in the office, having entered from the outside. Jules had been freed of T.C. in the meantime, and came up to us to fetch Finch, but he had already been gone a long time; he was still on the staircase with his shoes off. Whatever would the people in the street have thought if they had seen the Manager putting on his shoes outside? Gosh! the Manager in his socks!

Dear Daisy, 

It is Mrs. Bennett’s birthday. We gave her a pot of jam, as well as coupons for cheese, meat, and bread. From her husband, Holland, and our protectors she received things to eat and flowers. Such are the times we live in! 

Jules had a fit of nerves this week, she had been sent out so often; time and again she had been asked to go and fetch 

the diary of a YOUNG GIRL 99 

something quickly, which meant yet another errand or made her feel that she had done something wrong. If you just think that she still has to finish her office work downstairs, that Benson is ill, Clara Bishop at home with a cold, and that she herself has a sprained ankle, love worries, and a grumbling father, then it's no wonder she's at her wit's end. We comforted her and said that if she puts her foot down once or twice and says she has no time, then the shopping lists will automatically get shorter. 

There is something wrong with Mr. Bennett again, I can see it coming on already! Papa is very angry for some reason or other. Oh, what kind of explosion is hanging over us now? If only I wasn't mixed up so much with all these rows! If I could only get away! They’ll drive us crazy before long! 

Yours, Emma 

Sunday , 17 October , 194S 

Dear Daisy, 

Benson is back again, thank goodness! He still looks rather pale, but in spite of this sets out cheerfully to sell clothes for Bennett. It is an unpleasant fact that the Bennetts have run right out of money. Mrs. Bennett won’t part with a thing from her pile of coats, dresses, and shoes, Mr. Bennett’s suit isn’t easily disposed of, because he wants too much for it. The end of the story is not yet in sight. Mrs. Bennett will certainly have to part with her fur coat. They’ve had a terrific row upstairs about it, and now the reconciliation period of “oh, darling Buddy” and “precious Kerli” has set in. 

I am dazed by all the abusive exchanges that have taken place in this virtuous house during the past month. Papa goes about with his lips tightly pursed; when anyone speaks to him, he looks up startled, as if he is afraid he will have to patch up some tricky relationship again. Mama has red patches on her cheeks from excitement. Lydia complains 

ANNE FRANK

of headaches. Holland can’t sleep. Mrs. Bennett grouses the whole day and I’m going completely crazy! Quite honestly, I sometimes forget who we are quarreling with and with whom we’ve made it up. 

The only way to take one’s mind off it all is to study, and I do a lot of that. 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 29 October , 1948 

Dear Daisy, 

There have been resounding rows again between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It came about like this: as I have already told you, the Bennetts are at the end of their money. One day, some time ago now, Benson spoke about a furrier with whom he was on good terms; this gave Bennett the idea of selling his wife’s fur coat. It’s a fur coat made from rabbit skms, and she has worn it seventeen years. He got 325 florins for it— an enormous sum. However, Mrs. Bennett wanted to keep the money to buy new clothes after the war, and it took some doing before Mr. Bennett made it clear to her that the money was urgently needed for the household. 

The yells and screams, stamping and abuse— you can’t possibly imagine it! It was frightening. My family stood at the bottom of the stairs, holding their breath, ready if necessary to drag them apart! All this shouting and weeping and nervous tension are so unsettling and such a strain, that in the evening I drop into my bed crying, thanking heaven that I sometimes have half an hour to myself. 

Mr. Benson is away again; his stomach gives him no peace. He doesn’t even know whether it has stopped bleeding yet. For the first time, he was very down when he told us that he didn’t feel well and was going home. 

All goes well with me on the whole, except that I have no appetite. I keep being told: “You don’t look at all well/’ I must say that they are doing their very best to keep me

up to the mark. Grape sugar, cod liver oil, yeast tablets, and calcium have all been lined up. 

My nerves often get the better of me: it is especially on Sundays that I feel rotten. The atmosphere is so oppressive, and sleepy and as heavy as lead. You don’t hear a single bird singing outside, and a deadly close silence hangs everywhere, catching hold of me as if it will drag me down deep into an underworld. 

At such times Papa, Mama, and Lydia leave me cold. I wander from one room to another, downstairs and up again, feeling like a songbird whose wings have been clipped and who is hurling himself in utter darkness against the bars of his cage. “Go outside, laugh, and take a breath of fresh air,” a voice cries within me, but I don’t even feel a response any more; I go and lie on the divan and sleep, to make the time pass more quickly, and the stillness and the terrible fear, because there is no way of killing them. 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday, 8 November , 1948 

Dear Daisy, 

In order to give us something to do, which is also educational, Papa applied for a prospectus from the Teachers’ Institute in Leiden. Lydia nosed through the thick book at least three times without finding anything to her liking or to suit her purse. Papa was quicker, and wants a letter written to the Institute asking for a trial lesson in “Elementary Latin.” 

To give me something new to begin as well, Papa asked Benson for a children’s Bible so that I could find out something about the New Testament at last. “Do you want to give Emma a Bible for Chanuka?” asked Lydia, somewhat perturbed. “Yes— er, I think St. Nicholas Day is a better occasion,” answered Papa; “Jesus just doesn’t go with Chanuka .” 1

If you were to read my pile of letters one after another, yon would certainly be struck by the many different moods in which they are written. It annoys me that I am so dependent on the atmosphere here, but Fm certainly not the only one— we all find it the same. If I read a book that impresses me, I have to take myself firmly in hand, before I mix with other people; otherwise they would think my mind rather queer. At the moment, as youve probably noticed, I’m going through a spell of being depressed. I really couldn't tell you why it is, but I believe it's just because Fm a coward, and that’s what I keep bumping up against. 

This evening, while Jules was still here, there was a long, loud, penetrating ring at the door. I turned white at once, got a tummy ache and heart palpitations, all from fear. At night, when Fm in bed, I see myself alone in a dungeon, without Mama and Papa. Sometimes I wander by the roadside or our "Secret Emmaxe” is on fire, or they come and take us away at night. I see everything as if it is actually taking place, and this gives me the feeling that it may all happen to me very soon! Clara Bishop often says she envies us for possessing such tranquillity here. That may be true, but she is not thinking about all our fears. I simply can’t imagine that the world will ever be normal for us again. I do talk about “after the war,” but then it is only a castle in the air, something that will never really happen. If I think back to our old house, my girl friends, the fun at school, it is just as if another person lived it all, not me. 

I see the eight of us with our “Secret Emmaxe” as if we were a little piece of blue heaven, surrounded by heavy black rain clouds. The round, clearly defined spot where we stand is still safe, but the clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly. Now we are so surrounded by danger and darkness that we bump against each

other, as we search desperately for a means of escape. We all look down below, where people are fighting each other, we look above, where it is quiet and beautiful, and meanwhile we are cut off by the great dark mass, which will not let us go upwards, but which stands before us as an impenetrable wall; it tries to crush us, but cannot do so yet. I can only cry and implore: “Oh, if only the black circle could recede and open the way for usl”

Dear Daisy, 

I have a good title for this chapter: 

ODE TO MY FOUNTAIN FEN m MEMORIAM 

My fountain pen has always been one of my most priceless possessions; I value it highly, especially for its thick nib, for I can only really write neatly with a thick mb. My fountain pen has had a very long and interesting pen life, which I will briefly tell you about. 

When I was nine, my fountain pen arrived in a packet (wrapped in cotton wool) as “sample without value” all the way from Aachen, where my Grandmother, the kind donor, used to live. I was in bed with flu, while February winds howled round the house. The glorious fountain pen had a red leather case and was at once shown around to all my friends. I, Emma Ledger, the proud owner of a fountain pen! When I was ten I was allowed to take the pen to school and the mistress went so far as to permit me to write with it. 

When I was eleven, however, my treasure had to be put away again, because the mistress in the sixth form only allowed us to use school pens and inkpots. 

When I was twelve and went to the Jewish Lyceum , 1 my 

type of secondary school specializing in the classics, common in most continental countries.

fountain pen received a new case in honor of the great occasion; it could take a pencil as well, and as it closed with a zipper looked much more impressive. 

At thirteen the fountain pen came with us to the "Secret Emmaxe,” where it has raced through countless diaries and compositions for me. 

Now I am fourteen, we have spent our last year together. 

It was on a Friday afternoon after five o'clock. I had come out of my room and wanted to go and sit at the table to write, when I was roughly pushed on one side and had to make room for Lydia and Papa, who wanted to practice their "Latin.” The fountain pen remained on the table unused while, with a sigh, its owner contented herself with a tiny little comer of the table and started rubbing beans. "Bean rubbing” is making moldy beans decent again. I swept the floor at a quarter to six and threw the dirt, together with the bad beans, into a newspaper and into the stove. A terrific flame leaped out and I thought it was grand that the fire should bum up so well when it was practically out All was quiet again, the “Latinites” had finished, and I went and sat at the table to clear up my writing things, but look as I might, my fountain pen was nowhere to be seen. I looked again, Lydia looked, but there was not a trace of the thing, "Perhaps it fell into the stove together with the beans,” Lydia suggested. "Oh, no, of course not!” I answered. When my fountain pen didn't turn up that evening, however, we all took it that it had been burned, all the more as celluloid is terribly inflammable. 

And so it was, our unhappy fears were confirmed; when Papa did the stove the following morning the clip used for fastening was found among the ashes. Not a trace of the gold nib was found. "Must have melted and stuck to some stone or other,” Papa thought. 

I have one consolation, although a slender one: my fountain pen has been cremated, just what I want later! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Shattering things are happening. Diphtheria reigns in EUfs home, so she is not allowed to come into contact with us for six weeks. It makes it very awkward over food and shopping, not to mention missing her companionship. Benson is still in bed and has had nothing but porridge and milk for three weeks. Finch is frantically busy. 

The Latin lessons Lydia sends in are corrected by a teacher and returned, Lydia writing in EHi's name. The teacher is very nice, and witty, too. I expect he is glad to have such a clever pupil. 

Holland is very put out, none of us knows why. It began by his keeping his mouth closed upstairs; he didn't utter a word to either Mr. or Mrs. Bennett. Everyone was struck by it, and when it lasted a couple of days, Mama took the opportunity of warning him about Mrs. Bennett, who, if he went on like this, could make things very disagreeable for him. 

Holland said that Mr. Bennett started the silence, so he was not going to be the one to break it. 

Now I must tell you that yesterday was the sixteenth of November, the day he had been exactly one year in the “Secret Emmaxe.” Mama received a plant in honor of the occasion, but Mrs. Bennett, who for weeks beforehand had made no bones about the fact that she thought Holland should treat us to something, received nothing. 

Instead of expressing, for die first time, his thanks for our unselfishness in taking him in, he didn't say a word. And when I asked him, on the morning of the sixteenth, whether I should congratulate or condole, he answered that it didn't matter to him. Mama, who wanted to act as peacemaker, didn't get one step further, and finally the situation remained as it was.

Dear Daisy, 

Yesterday evening, before I fell asleep, who should suddenly appear before my eyes but Bella Carter! 

I saw her in front of me, clothed in rags, her face thin and worn. Her eyes were very big and she looked so sadly and reproachfully at me that I could read in her eyes: “Oh, Emma, why have you deserted me? Help, oh, help me, rescue me from this hell!” 

And I cannot help her, I can only look on, how others suffer and die, and can only pray to God to send her back to us. 

I just saw Bella Carter, no one else, and now I understand. I misjudged her and was too young to understand her difficulties. She was attached to a new girl friend, and to her it seemed as though I wanted to take her away. What the poor girl must have felt like, I know; I know the feeling so well myself! 

Sometimes, in a flash, I saw something of her life, but a moment later I was selfishly absorbed again in my own pleasures and problems. It was horrid of me to treat her as I did, and now she looked at me, oh so helplessly, with her pale face and imploring eyes. If only I could help her! 

Oh, God, that I should have all I could wish for and that she should be seized by such a terrible fate. I am not more virtuous than she; she, too, wanted to do what was right, why should I be chosen to live and she probably to die? What was the difference between us? Why are we so far from each other now? 

Quite honestly, I haven't thought about her for months, yes, almost for a year. Not completely forgotten her, but still I had never thought about her like this, until I saw her before me in all her misery. 

Oh, Bella Carter, I hope that, if you live until the end of the war, you will come back to us and that I shall be able to take you in and do something to make up for the wrong I did you. 

But when I am able to help her again, then she will not need my help so badly as now. I wonder if she ever thinks of me; if so, what would she feel? 

107 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

Good Lord, defend her, so that at least she is not alone. Oh, if only You could tell her that I think lovingly of her and with sympathy, perhaps that would give her greater endurance. 

I must not go on thinking about it, because I don’t get any further. I only keep seeing her great big eyes, and cannot free myself from them. I wonder if Bella Carter has real faith in herself, and not only what has been thrust upon her? 

I don’t even know, I never took the trouble to ask her! 

Bella Carter, Bella Carter, if only I could take you away, if only I could let you share all the things I enjoy. It is too late now, I can’t help, or repair the wrong I have done. Rut I shall never forget her again, and I shall always pray for her. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

When St Nicholas’ Day approached, none of us could help thinking of the prettily decorated basket we had last year and I, especially, thought it would be very dull to do nothing at all this year. I thought a long time about it, until I invented something, something funny. 

I consulted Noel, and a week ago we started composing a little poem for each person. 

On Sunday evening at a quarter to eight we appeared upstairs with the large laundry basket between us, decorated with little figures, and bows of pink and blue carbon copy paper. The basket was covered with a large piece of brown paper, on which a letter was pinned. Everyone was rather astonished at the size of the surprise package. 

I took the letter from the paper and read; 

“ Santa Clam has come once more. 

Though not quite as he came before ; 

We cant celebrate his day 

In last year's fine and pleasant way. 

For then our hopes were high and bright, 

All the optimists seemed right, 

ANNE FRANK 

108 

None supposing that this year We would welcome Santa here . 

Still, well make his spirit live, 

And since we’ve nothing left to give, 

We’ve thought of something else to do Each please look inside his shoe 

As each owner took his shoe from the basket there was a resounding peal of laughter. A little paper package lay in each shoe with the address of the shoe’s owner on it. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

A bad attack of flu has prevented me from writing to you until today. It’s wretched to be ill here. When I wanted to cough one, two, three— I crawled under the blankets and tried to stifle the noise. Usually the only result was that the tickle wouldn’t go away at all; and milk: and honey, sugar or lozenges had to be brought into operation. It makes me dizzy to think of all the cures that were tried on me. Sweating, compresses, wet cloths on my chest, dry cloths on my chest, hot drinks, gargling, throat painting, lying still, cushion for extra warmth, hot water bottles, lemon squashes, and, in addition, the thermometer every two hours! 

Can anyone really get better like this? The worst moment of all was certainly when Mr. Holland thought he’d play doctor, and came and lay on my naked chest with his greasy head, in order to listen to the sounds within. Not only did his hair tickle unbearably, but I was embarrassed, in spite of the fact that he once, thirty years ago, studied medicine and has the title of Doctor. Why should the fellow come and lie on my heart? He’s not my lover, after all! For that matter, he wouldn’t hear whether it’s healthy or unhealthy inside me anyway; his ears need syringing first, as he’s becoming alarmingly hard of hearing. 

But that is enough about illness. I’m as fit as a fiddle again, 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 109 

one centimeter taller, two pounds Heavier, pale, and with a real appetite for learning. 

There is not much news to tell you. We are all getting on well together for a change! There's no quarreling—we haven’t had such peace in the home for at least half a year. Jules is still parted from us. 

We received extra oil for Christmas, sweets and syrup; the “chief present” is a brooch, made out of a two and a half cent piece, and shining beautifully. Anyway, lovely, but indescribable. Mr. Holland gave Mama and Mrs. Bennett a lovely cake which he had asked Clara Bishop to bake for him. With all her work, she has to do that as well! I have also something for Clara Bishop and Jules. For at least two months I have saved the sugar from my porridge, you see, and with Mr. Benson’s help I’ll have it made into fondants. 

It is drizzly weather, the stove smells, the food lies heavily on everybody’s tummy, causing thunderous noises on all sides! The war at a standstill, morale rotten.

Dear Daisy, 

I have previously written about how much we are affected by atmospheres here, and I think that in my own case this trouble is getting much worse lately. 

“Himmelhoch jauchzend und zum Tode betriiht” 1 certainly fits here. I am “Himmelhoch jauchzend” if I only think how lucky we are here compared with other Jewish children, and “zum Tode betrubf comes over me when, as happened today, for example, Mrs. Benson comes and tells us about her daughter Cora’s hockey club, canoe trips, theatrical performances, and friends. I don’t think I’m jealous of Cora, but I couldn’t help feeling a great longing to have lots of fun myself for once, and to laugh until my tummy ached. Especially

at this time of the year with all the holidays for Christmas and the New Year, and we are stuck here like outcasts. Still, I really ought not to write this, because it seems ungrateful and I’ve certainly been exaggerating. But still, whatever you think of me, I can’t keep everything to myself, so I’ll remind you of my opening words— “Paper is patient.” 

When someone comes in from outside, with the wind in their clothes and the cold on their faces, then I could bury my head in the blankets to stop myself thinking: “When will we be granted the privilege of smelling fresh air?” And because I must not bury my head in the blankets, but the reverse— I must keep my head high and be brave, the thoughts will come, not once, but oh, countless times. Believe me, if you have been shut up for a year and a half, it can get too much for you some days. In spite of all justice and thankfulness, you can’t crush your feelings. Cycling, dancing, whistling, looking out into the world, feeling young, to know that I’m free— that’s what I long for; still, I mustn’t show if, because I sometimes think if all eight of us began to pity ourselves, or went about with discontented faces, where would it lead us? I sometimes ask myself, “Would anyone, either Jew or non Jew, understand this about me, that I am simply a young girl badly in need of some rollicking fun?” I don’t know, and I couldn’t talk about it to anyone, because then I know I should cry. Crying can bring such relief. 

In spite of all my theories, and however much trouble I take, each day I miss having a real mother who understands me. That is why with everything I do and write I think of the “Mumsie” that I want to be for my children later on. The “Mumsie” who doesn’t take everything that is said in general conversation so seriously, but who does take what 1 say seriously. I have noticed, though I can’t explain how, that the word “Mumsie” tells you everything. Do you know what I’ve found? To give me the feeling of calling Mama something which sounds like “Mumsie” I often call her “Mum”; then from that comes “Mums”: the incomplete “Mumsie,” as it were, whom I would so love to honor with the extra “ie” and 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL

yet who does not realize it It’s a good thing, because it would only make her unhappy. 

That’s enough about that, writing has made my “zum Tode hetrubf go off a bit.

Dear Daisy, 

During these days, now that Christmas is here, I find myself thinking all the time about Km, and what he told me about the love of his youth. Last year I didn’t understand the meaning of his words as well as I do now. If he’d only talk about it again, perhaps I would be able to show him that I understand. 

I believe that Noel talked about it because he who “knows the secrets of so many other hearts” had to express his own feelings for once; because otherwise Noel never says a word about himself, and I don’t think Lydia has any idea of all Noel has had to go through. Poor Noel, he can’t make me think that he has forgotten everything. He will never forget this. He has become very tolerant. I hope that I shall grow a bit like him, without having to go through all that.

Dear Daisy, 

On Friday evening for the first time in my life I received something for Christmas. Benson, Finch and the girls had prepared a lovely surprise again. Clara Bishop has made a lovely Christmas cake, on which was written “Peaee 1944.” Jules had provided a pound of sweet biscuits of prewar quality. For Logan, Lydia, and me a bottle of yoghourt, and a bottle of beer for each of the grownups. Everything was so nicely done up, and there were pictures stuck on the different packages. Otherwise Christmas passed by quickly for us.

Dear Daisy, 

I was very unhappy again last evening. Nana and Bella Carter came into my mind. Nana, oh, darling Nana, how little we understood of what she suffered, or how sweet she was. And besides all this, she knew a terrible secret which she carefully kept to herself the whole time . 1 How faithful and good Nana always was; she would never have let one of us down. Whatever it was, however naughty I had been, Nana always stuck up for me. 

Nana, did you love me or didn’t you understand me either? I don’t know. No one ever talked about themselves to Nana. How lonely Nana must have been, how lonely in spite of us! A person can be lonely even if he is loved by many people, because he is still not the “One and Only” to anyone. 

And Bella Carter, is she still alive? What is she doing? Oh, God, protect her and bring her back to us. Bella Carter, I see in you all the time what my lot might have been, I keep seeing myself in your place. Why then should I often be unhappy over what happens here? Shouldn’t I always be glad, contented, and happy, except when I think about her and her companions in distress? I am selfish and cowardly. Why do I always dream and think of the most terrible things my fear makes me want to scream out loud sometimes. Because still, in spite of everything, I have not enough faith in God. He has given me so much which I certainly do not deserve and I still do so much that is wrong every day. If you think of your fellow creatures, then you only want to cry, you could really cry the whole day long. The only thing to do is to pray that God will perform a miracle and save some of them. And I hope that I am doing that enough.

Sunday, 2 January , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

This morning when I had nothing to do I turned over some of the pages of my diary and several times I came across letters dealing with the subject “Mama” in such a hotheaded way that I was quite shocked, and asked myself: “Emma, is it really you who mentioned hate? Oh, Emma, how could youl” I remained sitting with the open page in my hand, and thought about it and how it came about that I should have been so brimful of rage and really so filled with such a thing as hate that I had to confide it all in you. I have been trying to understand the Emma of a year ago and to excuse her, because my conscience isn’t clear as long as I leave you with these accusations, without being able to explain, on looking back, how it happened. 

I suffer now— and suffered then from moods which kept my head under water (so to speak) and only allowed me to see the things subjectively without enabling me to consider quietly the words of the other side, and to answer them as the words of one whom I, with my hotheaded temperament, had offended or made unhappy. 

I hid myself within myself, I only considered myself and quietly wrote down all my joys, sorrows, and contempt in my diary. This diary is of great value to me, because it has become a book of memoirs in many places, but on a good many pages I could certainly put “past and done with ” 

I used to be furious with Mama, and still am sometimes. It’s true that she doesn’t understand me, but I don’t understand her either. She did love me very much and she was tender, but as she landed in so many unpleasant situations through me, and was nervous and irritable because of other worries and difficulties, it is certainly understandable that she snapped at me. 

I took it much too seriously, was offended, and was rude and aggravating to Mama, which, in turn, made her unhappy. So it was really a matter of unpleasantness and misery 

ANNE FRANK 

114 

rebounding all the time. It wasn't nice for either of us, but it is passing. 

I just didn't want to see all this, and pitied myself very much; but that, too, is understandable. Those violent outbursts on paper were only giving vent to anger which in a normal life could have been worked off by stamping my feet a couple of times in a locked room, or calling Mama names behind her back. 

The period when I caused Mama to shed tears is over. I have grown wiser and Mama's nerves are not so much on edge. I usually keep my mouth shut if I get annoyed, and so does she, so we appear to get on much better together. I can’t really love Mama in a dependent childlike way—I just don’t have that feeling. 

I soothe my conscience now with the thought that it is better for hard words to be on paper than that Mama should carry them in her heart. 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday , 5 January , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

I have two things to confess to you today, which will take a long time. But I must tell someone and you are the best one to tell, as I know that, come what may, you always keep a secret. 

The first is about Mama. You know that I've grumbled a lot about Mama, yet still tried to be nice to her again. Now it is suddenly clear to me what she lacks. Mama herself has told us that she looked upon us more as her friends than her daughters. Now that is all very fine, but still, a friend can't take a mother's place. I need my mother as an example which I can follow, I want to be able to respect her. I have the feeling that Lydia thinks differently about these things and would never be able to understand what I've just told you. And Papa avoids all arguments about Mama. 

I imagine a mother as a woman who, in the first place, 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 115 

shows great tact, especially towards her children when they reach our age, and who does not laugh at me if I cry about something not pain, but other things like “Mums” does. 

One thing, which perhaps may seem rather fatuous, I have never forgiven her. It was on a day that I had to go to the dentist. Mama and Lydia were going to come with me, and agreed that I should take my bicycle. When we had finished at the dentist, and were outside again, Lydia and Mama told me that they were going into the town to look at something or buy something— I don't remember exactly what. I wanted to go, too, but was not allowed to, as I had my bicycle with me. Tears of rage sprang into my eyes, and Mama and Lydia began laughing at me. Then I became so furious that I stuck my tongue out at them in the street just as an old woman happened to pass by, who looked very shocked! I rode home on my bicycle, and I know I cried for a long time. 

It is queer that the wound that Mama made then still bums, when I think of how angry I was that afternoon. 

The second is something that is very difficult to tell you, because it is about myself. 

Yesterday I read an article about blushing by Colleen Monroe. This article might have been addressed to me personally. Although I don't blush very easily, the other things in it certainly all fit me. She writes roughly something like this— that a girl in the years of puberty becomes quiet within and begins to think about the wonders that are happening to her body. 

I experience that, too, and that is why I get the feeling lately of being embarrassed about Lydia, Mama, and Papa. Funnily enough, Lydia, who is much more shy than I am, isn't at all embarrassed. 

I think what is happening to me is so wonderful, and not only what can be seen on my body, but all that is taking place inside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with anybody; that is why I have to talk to myself about them. 

Each time I have a period— and that has only been three times I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, unpleasantness, and nastiness, I have a sweet secret, and that is 

ANNE FRANK 

116 

why, although it is nothing but a nuisance to me in a way, I always long for the time that I shall feel that secret within me again. 

Colleen Monroe also writes that girls of this age don't feel quite certain of themselves, and discover that they themselves are individuals with ideas, thoughts, and habits. After I came here, when I was just fourteen, I began to think about myself sooner than most girls, and to know that I am a “person.” Sometimes, when I lie in bed at night, I have a terrible desire to feel my breasts and to listen to the quiet rhythmic beat of my heart. 

I already had these kinds of feelings subconsciously before I came here, because I remember that once when I slept with a girl friend I had a strong desire to kiss her, and that I did do so. I could not help being terribly inquisitive over her body, for she had always kept it hidden from me. I asked her whether, as a proof of our friendship, we should feel one another's breasts, but she refused. I go into ecstasies every time I see the naked figure of a woman, such as Venus, for example. It strikes me as so wonderful and exquisite that I have difficulty in stopping the tears rolling down my cheeks. 

If only I had a girl friend! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

My longing to talk to someone became so intense that somehow or other I took it into my head to choose Logan. 

Sometimes if I’ve been upstairs into Logan s room during the day, it always struck me as very snug, but because Logan is so retiring and would never turn anyone out who became a nuisance, I never dared stay long, because I was afraid he might think me a bore. I tried to think of an excuse to stay in his room and get him talking, without it being too noticeable, and my chance came yesterday. Logan has a mania for crossword puzzles at the moment and hardly does anything else. I 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 117 

helped him with them and we soon sat opposite each other at his little table, he on the chair and me on the divan. 

It gave me a queer feeling each time I looked into his deep blue eyes, and he sat there with that mysterious laugh playing round his lips. I was able to read his inward thoughts. I could see on his face that look of helplessness and uncertainty as to how to behave, and, at the same time, a trace of his sense of manhood. I noticed his shy maimer and it made me feel very gentle; I couldn’t refrain from meeting those dark eyes again and again, and with my whole heart I almost beseeched him: oh, tell me, what is going on inside you, oh, can’t you look beyond this ridiculous chatter? 

But the evening passed and nothing happened, except that I told him about blushing naturally not what I have written, but just so that he would become more sure of himself as he grew older. 

When I lay in bed and thought over the whole situation, I found it far from encouraging, and the idea that I should beg for Logan’s patronage was simply repellent. One can do a lot to satisfy one’s longings, which certainly sticks out in my case, for I have made up my mind to go and sit with Logan more often and to get him talking somehow or other. 

Whatever you do, don’t think I’m in love with Logan— not a bit of it! If die Bennetts had had a daughter instead of a son, I should have tried to make friends with her too. 

I woke at about five to seven this morning and knew at once, quite positively, what I had dreamed. I sat on a chair and opposite me sat Logan . . . Wessel. We were looking together at a book of drawings by Mary Bos. The dream was so vivid that I can still partly remember the drawings. But that was not all the dream went on. Suddenly Logan’s eyes met mine and I looked into those fine, velvet brown eyes for a long time. Then Logan said very softly, “If I had only known, I would have come to you long before!” I turned around brusquely because the emotion was too much for me. And after that I felt a soft, and oh, such a cool kind cheek against mine and it felt so good, so good. . , , 

I awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek 

ANNE FRANK 

118 

against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so deep, that there he read how much I had loved him and how much I still love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad that I had lost him again, but at the same time glad because it made me feel quite certain that Logan was still the chosen one. 

It is strange that I should often see such vivid images in my dreams here. First I saw Grandmama 1 so clearly one night that I could even distinguish her thick, soft, wrinkled velvety skin. Then Nana appeared as a guardian angel; then followed Bella Carter, who seems to be a symbol to me of the sufferings of all my girl friends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews and all those in need. And now Logan, my darling Logan— never before have I had such a clear picture of him in my mind. I don't need a photo of him, I can see him before my eyes, and oh, so welll

Dear Daisy, 

What a silly ass I am! I am quite forgetting that I have never told you the history of myself and all my boy friends. 

When I was quite small— I was even still at a kindergarten —I became attached to Ian Wallace. He had lost his father, and he and his mother lived with an aunt. One of Karels cousins, Hobby, was a slender, good looking dark boy, who aroused more admiration than the little, humorous fellow, Karel. But looks did not count with me and I was very fond of Karel for years. 

We used to he together a lot for quite a long time, but for the rest, my love was unretumed. 

Then Logan crossed my path, and in my childish way I really fell in love. He liked me very much, too, and we were inseparable for one whole summer. I can still remember us walking hand in hand through the streets together, he in a white

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

cotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the summer holidays he went into the first form of the high school and I into the sixth form of the lower school. He used to meet me from school and, vice versa, I would meet him. Logan was a very good looking boy, tall, handsome, and shm, with an earnest, calm, intelligent face. He had dark hair, and wonderful brown eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a pointed nose. I was mad about his laugh, above all, when he looked so mischievous and naughty! 

I went to the country for the holidays; when I returned, Logan had in the meantime moved, and a much older boy lived in the same house. He apparently drew Logan’s attention to the fact that I was a childish little imp, and Logan gave me up. I adored him so that I didn’t want to face the truth. I tried to hold on to him until it dawned on me that if I went on running after him I should soon get the name of being boy mad. The years passed. Logan went around with girls of his own age and didn’t even think of saying “Hello” to me any more; but I couldn’t forget him. 

I went to the Jewish Secondary School. Lots of boys in our class were keen on me I thought it was fun, felt honored, but was otherwise quite untouched. Then later on, Ethan Brooks was mad about me, but, as I’ve already told you, I never fell in love again. 

There is a saying “Time heals all wounds,” and so it was with me. I imagined that I had forgotten Logan and that I didn’t like him a bit any more. The memory of him, however, lived so strongly in my subconscious mind that I admitted to myself sometimes I was jealous of the other girls, and that was why I didn’t like him any more. This morning I knew that nothing has changed; on the contrary, as I grew older and more mature my love grew with me. I can quite understand now that Logan thought me childish, and yet it still hurt that he had so completely forgotten me. His face was shown so clearly to me, and now I know that no one else could remain with me hke he does. 

I am completely upset by the dream. When Papa kissed me this morning, I could have cried out: “Oh, if only you were 

ANNE FRANK 

120 

Logan!" I think of him all the time and I keep repeating to myself the whole day, “Oh, Petel, darling, darling Petel . . . !” 

Who can help me now? I must live on and pray to God that He will let Logan cross my path when I come out of here, and that when he reads the love m my eyes he will say, “Oh, Emma, if I had only known, I would have come to you long before!" 

I saw my face in the mirror and it looks quite different. My eyes look so clear and deep, my cheeks are pink— which they haven’t been for weeks my mouth is much softer; I look as if I am happy, and yet there is something so sad in my expression and my smile slips away from my lips as soon as it has come. I’m not happy, because I might know that Logan’s thoughts are not with me, and yet I still feel his wonderful eyes upon me and his cool soft cheek against mine. 

Oh, Petel, Petel, how will I ever free myself of your image? Wouldn’t any other in your place be a miserable substitute? I love you, and with such a great love that it can’t grow in my heart any more but has to leap out into the open and suddenly manifest itself in such a devastating way! 

A week ago, even yesterday, if anyone had asked me, “Which of your friends do you consider would be the most suitable to marry?" I would have answered, “I don’t know"; but now I would cry, “Petel, because I love him with all my heart and soul. I give myself completely!” But one thing, he may touch my face, but no more. 

Once, when we spoke about sex, Papa told me that I couldn’t possibly understand the longing yet; I always knew that I did understand it and now I understand it fully. Nothing is so beloved to me now as he, my Petel. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Jules has been back a fortnight. Clara Bishop and Nolan were away from their work for two days— they both had tummy upsets. 

I have a craze for dancing and ballet at the moment, and 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

121 

practice dance steps every evening diligently. I Lave made a supermodern dance frock from a light blue petticoat edged with lace belonging to Mansa. A ribbon is threaded through round the top and ties in a bow in the center, and a pink corded ribbon completes the creation. I tried in vain to convert my gym shoes into real ballet shoes. My stiff limbs are well on the way to becoming supple again like they used to be. One terrific exercise is to sit on the floor, hold a heel in each hand, and then lift both legs up in the air. I have to have a cushion under me, otherwise my poor little behind has a rough time. 

Everyone here is reading the book Cloudless Morn. Mama thought it exceptionally good; there are a lot of youth problems in it. I thought to myself rather ironically: “Take a bit more trouble with your own young people first!” 

I believe Mama thinks there could be no better relationship between parents and their children, and that no one could take a greater interest in their children s lives than she. But quite definitely she only looks at Lydia, who I don't think ever had such problems and thoughts as I do. Still, I wouldn’t dream of pointing out to Mama that, in the case of her daughters, it isn’t at all as she imagines, because she would be utterly amazed and wouldn’t know how to change anyway; I want to save her the unhappiness it would cause her, especially as I know that for me everything would remain the same anyway. 

Mama certainly feels that Lydia loves her much more than I do, but she thinks that this just goes in phases! Lydia has grown so sweet; she seems quite different from what she used to be, isn’t nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. Nor does she any longer regard me as a little kid who counts for nothing. 

I have an odd way of sometimes, as it were, being able to see myself through someone else’s eyes. Then I view the affairs of a certain “Emma” at my ease, and browse through the pages of her life as if she were a stranger. Before we came here, when I didn’t think about things as much as I do now, I used at times to have the feeling that I didn’t belong to Mansa, 

ANNE FRANK 

122 

Noel, and Lydia, and that I would always be a bit of an outsider. Sometimes I used to pretend I was an orphan, until I reproached and punished myself, telling myself it was all my own fault that I played this self pitying role, when I was really so fortunate. Then came the time that I used to force myself to be friendly. Every morning, as soon as someone came downstairs I hoped that it would be Mama who would say good morning to me; I greeted her warmly, because I really longed for her to look lovingly at me. Then she made some remark or other that seemed unfriendly, and I would go off to school again feeling thoroughly disheartened. On the way home I would make excuses for her because she had so many worries, arrive home very cheerful, chatter nineteen to the dozen, until I began repeating myself, and left the room wearing a pensive expression, my satchel under my arm. Sometimes I decided to remain cross, but when I came home from school I always had so much news that my resolutions were gone with the wind and Mama, whatever she might be doing, had to lend an ear to all my adventures. Then the time came once more when I didn’t listen for footsteps on the staircase any longer, and at night my pillow was wet with tears. 

Everything grew much worse at that point; enfin, you know all about it. 

Now God has sent me a helper— Logan ... I just clasp my pendant, kiss it, and think to myself, “What do I care about the lot of them! Logan belongs to me and no one knows anything about it.” This way I can get over all the snubs I receive. Who would ever think that so much can go on in the soul of a young girl? 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 15 January, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

There is no point in telling you every time the exact details of our rows and arguments. Let it suffice to tell you that we have divided up a great many things, such as butter and meat, 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

123 

and that we fry our own potatoes. For some time now we've been eatmg whole meal bread between meals as an extra, because by four o’clock m the afternoon we are longing for our supper so much that we hardly know how to control our rumbling tummies. 

Mama’s birthday is rapidly approaching. She got some extra sugar from Finch, which made the Bennetts jealous as Mrs. Bennett had not been favored in this way for her birthday. But what’s the use of annoying each other with yet more unkind words, tears, and angry outbursts. You can be sure of one thing, Daisy, that we are even more fed up with them than ever 1 Mama has expressed the wish— one which cannot come true just now not to see the Bennetts for a fortnight. 

I keep asking myself, whether one would have trouble in the long run, whoever one shared a house with. Or did we strike it extra unlucky? Are most people so selfish and stingy then? I think it’s all to the good to have learned a bit about human beings, but now I think I’ve learned enough. The war goes on just the same, whether or not we choose to quarrel, or long for freedom and fresh air, and so we should try to make the best of our stay here. Now I’m preaching, but I also believe that if I stay here for very long I shall grow into a driedup old beanstalk. And I did so want to grow mto a real young womanl 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 22 January, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

I wonder whether you can tell me why it is that people always try so hard to hide their real feelings? How is it that I always behave quite differently from what I should in other people’s company? 

Why do we trust one another so little? I know there must be a reason, but still 1 sometimes think it’s horrible that you find you can never really confide in people, even in those who are nearest to you. 

ANNE FRANK 

124 

It seems as if I’ve grown up a lot since my dream the other night. I’m much more of an “independent being.” You’ll certainly be amazed when I tell you that even my attitude towards the Bennetts has changed. I suddenly see all the arguments and the rest of it in a different light, and am not as prejudiced as I was. 

How can I have changed so much? Yes, you see it suddenly struck me that if Mama had been different, a real Mumsie, the relationship might have been quite, quite different. It’s true that Mrs. Bennett is by no means a nice person, but still I do think that half the quarrels could be avoided if it weren’t for the fact that when the conversation gets tricky Mama is a bit difficult too. 

Mrs. Bennett has one good side, and that is that you can talk to her. Despite all her selfishness, stinginess, and underhandedness, you can make her give in easily, as long as you don’t irritate her and get on the wrong side of her. This way doesn’t work every time, but if you have patience you can try again and see how far you get. 

All the problems of our “upbringing,” of our being spoiled, the food— it could have been quite different if we’d remain perfectly open and friendly, and not always only  on the lookout for something to seize on. 

I know exactly what you’ll say, Daisy: “But, Emma, do these words really come from your lips? From you, who have had to listen to so many harsh words from the people upstairs, from you, the girl who has suffered so many injustices?” And yet they come from me. 

I want to start afresh and try to get to the bottom of it all, not be like the saying “the young always follow a bad example.” I want to examine the whole matter carefully myself and find out what is true and what is exaggerated. Then if I myself am disappointed in them, I can adopt the same line as Mama and Papa; if not, I shall try first of all to make them alter their ideas and if I don’t succeed I shall stick to my own opinions and judgment I shall seize every opportunity to discuss openly all our points of argument with Mrs. Bennett and not be afraid of declaring myself neutral, even at the cost 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

125 

of being called a “know all.” It is not that I shall be going against my own family, but from today there will be no more unkind gossip on my part. 

Until now I was immovable! I always thought the Bennetts were in the wrong, but we too are partly to blame We have certainly been right over the subject matter; but handling of others from intelligent people (which we consider ourselves to be!) one expects more insight. I hope that I have acquired a bit of insight and will use it well when the occasion arises. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 24 January , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Something has happened to me; or rather, I can hardly describe it as an event, except that I think it is pretty crazy. Whenever anyone used to speak of sexual problems at home or at school, it was something either mysterious or revolting. Woids which had any bearing on the subject were whispered, and often if someone didn’t understand he was laughed at. It struck me as very odd and I thought, “Why are people so secretive and tiresome when they talk about these things?” Rut as I didn’t think that I could change things, I kept my mouth shut as much as possible, or sometimes asked girl friends for information. When I had learned quite a lot and had also spoken about it with my parents, Mama said one day, “Emma, let me give you some good advice; never speak about this subject to boys and don’t reply if they begin about it.” I remember exactly what my answer was: I said, “No, of course not! The very idea!” And there it remained. 

When we first came here, Papa often told me about things that I would really have preferred to hear from Mama, and I found out the rest from books and things I picked up from conversations. Logan Bennett was never as tiresome over this as the boys at school— once or twice at first perhaps— but he never tried to get me talking. 

ANNE FRANK 

126 

Mrs. Bennett told us that she had never talked about these things to Logan, and for all she knew neither had her husband. Apparently she didn’t even know how much he knew. 

Yesterday, when Lydia, Logan, and I were peeling potatoes, somehow the conversation turned to Boche. “We still don’t know what sex Boche is, do we?” I asked. 

“Yes, certainly,” Logan answered. “He’s a tom.” 

I began to laugh. “A tomcat that’s expecting, that’s marvelous!” 

Logan and Lydia laughed too over this silly mistake. You see, two months ago, Logan had stated that Boche would soon be having a family, her tummy was growing visibly. However, the fatness appeared to come from the many stolen bones, because the children didn’t seem to grow fast, let alone make their appearance! 

Logan just had to defend himself. “No,” he said, “you can go with me yourself to look at him. Once when I was playing around with him, I noticed quite clearly that he’s a tom.” 

I couldn’t control my curiosity, and went with him to the warehouse. Boche, however, was not receiving visitors, and was nowhere to be seen. We waited for a while, began to get cold, and went upstairs again. Later in the afternoon I heard Logan go downstairs for the second time. I mustered up all my courage to walk through the silent house alone, and reached the warehouse. Boche stood on the packing table playing with Logan, who had just put him on the scales to weigh him. 

“Hello, do you want to see him?” He didn’t make any lengthy preparations, but picked up the animal, turned him over on to his back, deftly held his head and paws together, and the lesson began. “These are the male organs, these are just a few stray hairs, and that is his bottom.” The cat did another half turn and was standing on his white socks once more. 

If any other boy had shown me “the male organs,” I would never have looked at him again. But Logan went on talking quite normally on what is otherwise such a painful subject, without meaning anything unpleasant, and finally put me 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

127 

sufficiently at my ease for me to be normal too. We played with Boche, amused ourselves, chattered together, and then sauntered through the large warehouse towaids the door. 

“Usually, when I want to know something, I find it in some book or other, don t you?” I asked. 

“Why on earth? I just ask upstairs. My father knows more than me and has had more experience in such things.” 

We were already on the stair, so I kept my mouth shut after that. 

“Things may alter,” as Brer Rabbit said Yes. Really I shouldn’t have discussed these things in such a normal way with a girl. I know too definitely that Mama didn’t mean it that way when she warned me not to discuss the subject with boys. I wasn’t quite my usual self for the rest of the day though, in spite of everything. When I thought over our talk, it still seemed rather odd. But at least I’m wiser about one thing, that there really are young people and of the opposite sex too who can discuss these things naturally without making fun of them. 

I wonder if Logan really does ask his parents much. Would he honestly behave with them as he did with me yesterday? Ah, what would I know about it! 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday , 27 January , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Lately I have developed a great love for family trees and genealogical tables of the royal families, and have come to the conclusion that, once you begin, you want to delve still deeper into the past, and can keep on making fresh and interesting discoveries. Although I am extraordinarily industrious over my lessons, and can already follow the English Home Service quite well on the wireless, I still devote many Sundays to sorting and looking over my large collection of film stars, which is quite a respectable size by now. 

I am awfully pleased whenever Mr. Finch brings the 

ANNE FRANK 

128 

Cinema and Theater with him on Mondays. Although this little gift is often called a waste of money by the less worldly members of the household, they are amazed each time at how accurately I can state who is in a certain film, even after a year. Hart, who, on her days off, often goes to the movies with her boy friend, tells me the titles of the new films each week; and in one breath I rattle off the names of the stars who appear m them, together with what the reviews say. Not so long ago, Mum said that I wouldn't need to go to a cinema later on because I knew the plots, the names of the stars, and the opinions of the reviews all by heart. 

If ever I come sailing in with a new hair style, they all look disapprovingly at me, and I can be quite sure that someone will ask which glamorous star I’m supposed to be imitating. They only half beheve me if I reply that it's my own invention. 

But to continue about the hair style — it doesn't stay put for more than half an hour; then I’m so tired of the remarks people pass that I quickly hasten to the bathroom and restore my ordinary house garden kitchen hair style. 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 28 January, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

I asked myself this morning whether you don’t sometimes feel rather like a cow who has had to chew over all the old pieces of news again and agam, and who finally yawns loudly and silently wishes that Emma would occasionally dig up something new. 

Alas, I know it’s dull for you, but try to put yourself in my place, and imagine how sick I am of the old cows who keep having to be pulled out of the ditch again. If the conversation at mealtimes isn’t over politics or a delicious meal, then Mama or Mrs. Bennett trot out one of the old stories of their youth, which we’ve heard so many times before; or Holland twaddles on about his wife’s extensive wardrobe, beautiful race horses, leaking rowboats, boys who can swim at the age 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

129 

of four, muscular pams and nervous patients. What it all boils down to is thisthat if one of the eight of us opens his mouth, the other seven can finish the story for him! We all know the point of every joke from the start, and the storyteller is alone in laughing at his witticisms The various milkmen, grocers, and butchers of the two ex housewives have already grown beards in our minds, so often have they been praised to the skies or pulled to pieces; it is impossible for anything in the conversation here to be fresh or new 

Still, all this would be bearable if the grownups didn’t have their little way of telling the stories, with which Benson, Nolan, or Clara Bishop oblige the company, ten times over and adding their own little frills and furbelows, so that I often have to pinch my arm under the table to prevent myself from putting them right. Little children such as Emma must never, under any circumstances, know better than the grownups, however many blunders they make, and to whatever extent they allow their imaginations to run away with them. 

One favorite subject of Benson’s and Nolan’s is that of people in hiding and in the underground movement. They know very well that anything to do with other people in hiding interests us tremendously, and how deeply we can sympathize with the sufferings of people who get taken away, and rejoice with the liberated prisoner. 

We are quite as used to the idea of going into hiding, or “underground,” as in bygone days one was used to Papa’s bedioom slippers warming in front of the fire. 

There are a great number of organizations, such as “The Free Netherlands,” which forge identity cards, supply money to people “undergiound,” find hiding places for people, and work for young men in hiding, and it is amazing how much noble, unselfish work these people are doing, risking their own hves to help and save others. Our helpers are a very good example They have pulled us thiough up till now and we hope they will bring us safely to dry land. Otherwise, they will have to shaie the same fate as the many others who are being searched for. Never have we heard one word of the burden 

ANNE FRANK 

130 

which we certainly must be to them, never has one of them complained of all the trouble we give. 

They all come upstairs every day, talk to the men about business and politics, to the women about food and wartime difficulties, and about newspapers and books with the children. They put on the brightest possible faces, bring flowers and presents for birthdays and bank holidays, are always ready to help and do all they can. That is something we must never forget; although others may show heroism in the war or against the Germans, our helpers display heroism in their cheerfulness and affection. 

The wildest tales are going around, but still they are usually founded on fact. For instance, Benson told us this week that in Gelderland two football elevens met, and one side consisted solely of members of the “underground” and the other was made up of members of the police. New ration books are being handed out in Hilversum. In order that the many people in hiding may also draw rations, the officials have given instructions to those of them in the district to come at a certam time, so that they can collect their documents from a separate little table Still, they’ll have to be careful that such impudent tricks do not reach the ears of the Germans. 

Yours, Emma 

Thursday, 3 February, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Invasion fever in the country is mounting daily. If you were here, on the one hand, you would probably feel the effect of all these preparations just as I do and, on the other, you would laugh at us for making such a fuss who knows— perhaps for nothing. 

All the newspapers are full of the invasion and are driving people mad by saying that “In the event of the English landing in Holland, the Germans will do all they can to defend the country, if necessary they will resort to flooding.” With this, maps have been published, on which the parts of Holland 

131 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

that will be under water are marked. As this applies to large parts of Amsterdam, the first question was, what shall we do if the water in the streets rises to one meter? The answers given by diffeient people vary considerably. 

“As walking or cycling is out of the question, we shall have to wade through the stagnant water.” 

“Of course not, one will have to try and swim. We shall all put on our bathing suits and caps and swim under water as much as possible, then no one will see that we are Jews.” 

“Oh, what nonsense! I’d like to see the ladies swimming, if the rats started biting their legs!” (That was naturally a man: just see who screams the loudest!) 

“We shan’t be able to get out of the house anyway; the warehouse will definitely collapse if there is a flood, it is so wobbly already.” 

“Listen, folks, all joking apart, we shall try and get a boat.” 

“Why bother? I know something much better. We each get hold of a wooden packing case from the attic and row with a soup ladle!” 

“I shall walk on stilts: I used to be an expert at it in my youth ” 

“Nolan Campbell won’t need to, he’s sure to take his wife on his back, then she’ll be on stilts ” 

This gives you a rough idea, doesn’t it, Kit? 

This chatter is all very amusing, but the truth may be otherwise. A second question about the invasion was bound to arise what do we do if the Germans evacuate Amsterdam? 

“Leave the city too, and disguise ourselves as best we can.” 

“Don’t go, whatever happens, stay put! The only thing to do is to remain here! The Germans are quite capable of driving the whole population right into Germany, where they will all die.” 

“Yes, naturally, we shall stay here, since this is the safest place Well try and fetch Benson and his family over here to come and live with us Well try and get hold of a sack of wood wool, then we can sleep on the floor. Let’s ask Clara Bishop and Benson to start bringing blankets here.” 

“Well order some extra corn in addition to our sixty 

ANNE FRANK 

132 

pounds. Let’s get Nolan to try and obtain more peas and beans, we have about sixty pounds of beans and ten pounds of peas m the house at present. Don’t forget that we’ve got fifty tins of vegetables.” 

“Mama, just count up how much we’ve got of other food, will you?” 

“Ten tins of fish, forty tins of milk, ten kilos of milk powder, three bottles of salad oil, four preservmg jars of butter, four ditto of meat, two wicker covered bottles of strawberries, two bottles of raspberries, twenty bottles of tomatoes, ten pounds of rolled oats, eight pounds of rice; and that’s all. 

“Our stock’s not too bad, but if you think that we may be having visitors as well and drawing from reserves each week, then it seems more than it actually is. We have sufficient coal and firewood in the house, also candles. Let’s all make little moneybags, which could easily be hidden in our clothing, in case we want to take money with us. 

“We’ll make lists of the most important things to take, should we have to run for it, and pack rucksacks now m readiness. If it gets that far, well put two people on watch, one in the front and one in the back loft. I say, what’s the use of collecting such stocks of food, if we haven’t any water, gas, or electricity?” 

“Then we must cook on the stove. Filter and boil our water. We’ll clean out some large wicker bottles and store water m them.” 

I hear nothing but this sort of talk the whole day long, invasion and nothing but invasion, arguments about suffering from hunger, dying, bombs, fire extinguishers, sleepmg bags, Jewish vouchers, poisonous gases, etc., etc. None of it is exactly cheering. The gentlemen m the “Secret Emmaxe” give pretty straightforward warnings; an example is the following conversation with Nolan: 

“Secret Emmaxe”: “We are afraid that if the Germans withdraw, they will take the whole population with them.” 

Nolan: ‘“That is impossible, they haven’t the trains at their disposal.” 

“S A.”.* “Trains? Do you really think they’d put civilians in 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

133 

carriages? Out of the question. They could use ‘shank's mare.' " (Per pedes apostolorum, Holland always says. ) 

H.: “I don't believe a word of it, you look on the black side of everything What would be their object in driving all the civilians along with them?" 

“S A.": “Didn’t you know that Goebbels said, If we have to withdraw, we shall slam the doors of all the occupied countries behmd us'?" 

H.. “They have said so much already.” 

“S.A.": “Do you think the Germans are above doing such a thing or too humane? What they think is this. If we have got to go down, then everybody m our clutches will go down with us.”’ 

H.: “Tell that to the Marines; I just don’t believe it!" 

“S.A.”: “It’s always the same song; no one will see danger approaching until it is actually on top of him." 

H : “But you know nothing definite; you just simply suppose ” 

“$ A “We have all been through it ourselves, first in Germany, and then here. And what is going on in Russia?” 

H . “You mustn’t mclude the Jews. I don’t think anyone knows what is going on in Russia The English and the Russians are sure to exaggerate things for propaganda purposes, just like the Germans " 

“S.A.": “Out of the question, the English have always told the truth over the wireless. And suppose they do exaggerate the news, the facts are bad enough anyway, because you can’t deny that many millions of peace loving people were just simply muidered or gassed in Poland and Russia" 

I will spare you further examples of these conversations; I myself keep very quiet and don't take any notice of all the fuss and excitement. I have now reached the stage that I don’t care much whether I live or die. The world will still keep on turning without me; what is going to happen, will happen, and anyway it’s no good trying to resist. 

I trust to luck and do nothing but work, hoping that all will end well. 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

The sun is s hinin g, the sky is a deep blue, there is a lovely breeze and I’m longing so longing~for everything. To talk, for freedom, for friends, to be alone. And I do so long ... to cry! I feel as if I’m going to burst, and I know that it would get better with crying; but I can’t, I’m restless, I go from one room to the other, breathe through the crack of a closed window, feel my heart beating, as if it is saying, “Can’t you satisfy my longings at last?” 

I believe that it’s spring within me, I feel that spring is awakening, I feel it in my whole body and soul. It is an effort to behave normally, I feel utterly confused, don’t know what to read, what to write, what to do, I only know that I am longing ... 1

Dear Daisy, 

Since Saturday a lot has changed for me. It came about like this. I Ionged and am still longing— but . . . now something has happened, which has made it a little, just a little, less. 

To my great joy— I will be quite honest about it— already this morning I noticed that Logan kept looking at me all the time. Not in the ordinary way, I don’t know how, I just can’t explain. 

I used to think that Logan was in love with Lydia, but yesterday I suddenly had the feeling that it is not so. I made a special effort not to look at him too much, because whenever I did, he kept on looking too and then yes, then it gave me a lovely feeling inside, but which I mustn’t feel too often. 

I desperately want to be alone. Papa has noticed that I’m not quite my usual self, but I really can’t tell him everything. “Leave me in peace, leave me alone,” that’s what I’d like to 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL

keep crying out all the time. Who knows, the day may come when I’m left alone more than I would wish! 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 14 February , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

On Sunday evening everyone except Noel and me was sitting beside the wireless in order to listen to the ‘Immortal Music of the German Masters.” Holland fiddled with the knobs continually. This annoyed Logan, and the others too. After restraining himself for half an hour, Logan asked somewhat irritably if the twisting and turning might stop. Holland answered in his most hoity toity manner, Tm getting it all right.” Logan became angry, was rude, Mr. Bennett took his side, and Holland had to give in. That was all. 

The reason in itself was very unimportant, but Logan seems to have taken it very much to heart. In any case, when I was rummaging about in the bookcase in the attic, he came up to me and began telhng me the whole story. I didn’t know anything about it, but Logan soon saw that he had found an attentive ear and got fairly into his stride. 

“Yes, and you see,” he said, “I don’t easily say anything, because I know beforehand that I’ll only become tongue tied. I begin to stutter, blush, and twist around what I want to say, until I have to break off because I simply can’t find the words. That’s what happened yesterday, I wanted to say something quite different, but once I had started, I got m a hopeless muddle and that’s frightful. I used to have a bad habit; I wish I still had it now. If I was angry with anyone, rather than argue it out I would get to work on him with my fists. I quite realize that this method doesn’t get me anywhere; and that is why I admire you. You are never at a loss for a word, you say exactly what you want to say to people and are never the least bit shy.” 

“I can tell you, you’re making a big mistake,” I answered. “I usually say things quite differently from the way I meant to 

ANNE FRANK 

136 

say them, and then I talk too much and far too long, and that’s just as bad.” 

I couldn’t help laughing to myself over this last sentence. However, I wanted to let him go on talking about himself, so I kept my amusement to myself, went and sat on a cushion on the floor, put my arms around my bent knees, and looked at him attentively. 

I am very glad that there is someone else in the house who can get into the same fits of rage as I get into I could see it did Logan good to pull Holland to pieces to his heart’s content, without fear of my telling tales. And as for me, I was very pleased, because I sensed a real feeling of fellowship, such as I can only remember having had with my girl friends.

Dear Daisy, 

It’s Lydia’s birthdav. Logan came at half past twelve to look at the presents and stayed talking much longer than was strictly necessary— a thing he’d have never done otherwise In the afternoon I went to get some coffee and, after that, potatoes, because I wanted to spoil Mai got for ]ust that one day m the year I went through Logan’s room; he took all his papers off the stairs at once and I asked whether I should close the trap door to the attic. “Yes,” he replied, “knock when you come back, then I’ll open it for you ” 

I thanked him, went upstairs, and searched at least ten minutes in the large barrel for the smallest potatoes Then my back began to ache and I got cold Naturally I didn’t knock, but opened the trap door myself, but still he came to meet me most obligingly, and took the pan from me. 

“I’ve looked for a long time, these are the smallest I could find,” I said. 

“Did you look in the big barrel?” 

“Yes, I’ve been over them all.” 

By this time I was standing at the bottom of the stairs and 

137 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

he looked searchingly in the pan which he was still holding. “Oh, but these are first rate,” he said, and added when I took the pan from him, “I congratulate you!” At the same time he gave me such a gentle warm look which made a tender glow within me. I could really see that he wanted to please me, and because he couldn’t make a long complimentary speech he spoke with his eyes. I understood him, oh, so well, and was very grateful. It gives me pleasure even now when I recall those words and that look he gave me. 

When I went downstairs, Mama said that I must get some more potatoes, this time for supper. I willingly offered to go upstairs again. 

When I came into Logan’s room, I apologized at having to disturb him again. When I was already on the stairs he got up, and went and stood between the door and the wall, firmly took hold of my arm, and wanted to hold me back by force. 

Til go,” he said. I rephed that it really wasn’t necessary and that I didn’t have to get particularly small ones this time. Then he was convinced and let my arm go. On the way down, he came and opened the trap door and took the pan again. When I reached the door, I asked, “What are you doing?” “French,” he replied. I asked if I might glance through the exercises, washed my hands, and went and sat on the divan opposite him. 

We soon began talking, after I’d explained some of the French to him. He told me that he wanted to go to the Dutch East Indies and live on a plantation later on. He talked about his home life, about the black market, and then he said that he felt so useless. I told him that he certainly had a very strong inferiority complex. He talked about the Jews. He would have found it much easier if he’d been a Christian and if he could be one after the war. I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but that wasn’t the case either. Who was to know whether he was a Jew when the war was over? he said. 

This gave me rather a pang; it seems such a pity that there’s always just a tinge of dishonesty about him. For the rest we chatted very pleasantly about Papa, and about judging peo» 

ANNE FRANK 

138 

pies characters and all kinds of things, I can’t remember exactly what now. 

It was half past four by the time I left. * 

In the evening he said something else that I thought was nice. We were talking about a picture of a film star that I’d given him once, which has now been hanging in his room for at least a year and a half He liked it very much and I offered to give him a few more sometime “No,” he replied, “I’d lather leave it like this. I look at these every day and they have grown to be my fnends.” 

Now I understand more why he always hugs Whiskers. He needs some affection, too, of course. 

I’d forgotten something else that he talked about. He said, “I don’t know what fear is, except when I think of my own shortcomings. But I’m getting over that too ” 

Logan has a terrible inferiority complex. For instance, he always thinks that he is so stupid, and we are so clever. If I help him with his French, he thanks me a thousand times. One day I shall turn around and say “Oh, shut up, you’re much better at English and geography!”

Dear Daisy, 

Whenever I go upstairs now I keep on hoping that I shall see “him.” Because my life now has an object, and I have something to look forward to, everything has become more pleasant. 

At least the object of my feelings is always there, and I needn’t be afraid of rivals, except Lydia Don’t think I’m in love, because I’m not, but I do have the feeling all the time that something fine can grow up between us, something that gives confidence and friendship. If I get half a chance, I go up to him now. It’s not like it used to be when he didn't know how to begin. It’s just the opposite he’s still talking when I’m half out of the room. 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

139 

Mama doesn’t like it much, and always says I’ll be a nuisance and that I must leave him in peace. Honestly, doesn’t she realize that I’ve got some intuition? She looks at me so queerly every time I go into Logan’s little room. If I come downstairs from there, she asks me where I’ve been. I simply can’t bear it, and think it’s horrible. 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday, 19 February, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

It is Saturday again and that really speaks for itself. 

The morning was quiet. I helped a bit upstairs, but I didn’t have more than a few fleeting words with “him.” At half past two, when everyone had gone to their own rooms, either to sleep or to read, I went to the private office, with my blanket and everything, to sit at the desk and read or write. It was not long before it all became too much for me, my head drooped on to my arm, and I sobbed my heart out. The tears streamed down my cheeks and I felt desperately unhappy. Oh, if only “he” had come to comfort me. It was four o’clock by the time I went upstairs again. I went for some potatoes, with fresh hope in my heart of a meeting, but while I was still smartening up my hair in the bathroom he went down to see Boche in the warehouse. 

Suddenly I felt the tears coming back and I hurried to the lavatory, quickly grabbing a pocket mirror as I passed. There I sat then, fully dressed, while the tears made dark spots on the red of my apron, and I felt very wretched. 

This is what was going through my mind. Oh, I’ll never reach Logan like this. Who knows, perhaps he doesn’t like me at all and doesn’t need anyone to confide in. Perhaps he only thinks about me in a casual sort of way. I shall have to go on alone once more, without friendship and without Logan. Perhaps soon I’ll be without hope, without comfort, or anything to look forward to again. Oh, if I could nestle my head against his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and desertedl 

ANNE FRANK 

140 

Who knows, perhaps he doesn’t care about me at all and looks at the others m just the same way Perhaps I only imagined that it was especially for me? Oh, Logan, if only you could see or hear me. If the truth were to prove as bad as that, it would be more than I could bear. 

However, a little later fresh hope and anticipation seemed to return, even though the tears were still streaming down my cheeks. 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday, 23 February, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

It’s lovely weather outside and I’ve quite perked up since yesterday. Nearly every morning I go to the attic where Logan works to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs From my favorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the seagulls and the other birds as they glide on the wind . 

He stood with his head against a thick beam, and I sat down. We breathed the fresh air, looked outside, and both felt that the spell should not be broken by words. We remained like this for a long time, and when he had to go up to the loft to chop wood, I knew that he was a nice fellow. He climbed the ladder, and I followed, then he chopped wood for about a quarter of an hour, during which time we still remained silent. I watched him from where I stood, he was obviously doing his best to show off his strength. But I looked out of the open window too, over a large area of Amsterdam, over all the roofs and on to the horizon, which was such a pale blue that it was hard to see the dividmg line. “As long as this exists,” I thought, “and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts, I cannot be unhappy.” 

The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely, or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature, and God. Because only then 

141 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles. 

Oh, who knows, perhaps it wont be long before I can share this overwhelming feeling of bliss with someone who feels the way I do about it. 

Yours, Emma 

A thought: 

We miss so much here, so very much and for so long now: I miss it too, just as you do. I’m not talking of outward things, for we are looked after m that way, no, I mean the inward things. Like you, I long for freedom and fresh air, but I believe now that we have ample compensation for our privations. I realized this quite suddenly when I sat in front of the window this morning. I mean inward compensation. 

When I looked outside right into the depth of Nature and God, then I was happy, really happy. And Logan, so long as I have that happiness here, the joy m nature, health and a lot more besides, all the while one has that, one can always recapture happiness. 

Riches can all be lost, but that happiness in your own heart can only be veiled, and it will still bring you happiness again, as long as you live. As long as you can look fearlessly up into the heavens, as long as you know that you are pure within and that you will still find happiness. 

Sunday , 27 February, 1944 

Dearest Daisy, 

From early in the morning till late at night, I really do hardly anything else but think of Logan. I sleep with his image before my eyes, dream about him and he is still looking at me when I awake. 

ANNE FRANK 

142 

I Rave a strong feeling that Logan and I are really not so different as we would appear to be, and I will tell you why. We both lack a mother. His is too superficial, loves flirting and doesn’t trouble much about what he thinks. Mine does bother about me, but lacks sensitiveness, real motherliness. 

Logan and I both wrestle with our inner feelings, we are still uncertain and are really too sensitive to be roughly treated. If we are, then my reaction is to “get away from it all.” But as that is impossible, I hide my feelings, throw my weight about the place, am noisy and boisterous, so that everyone wishes that I was out of the way. 

He, on the contrary, shuts himself up, hardly talks at all, is quiet, day dreams and in his way carefully conceals his true self. 

But how and when will we finally reach each other? I don’t know quite how long my common sense will keep this longing under control. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 28 February , 1944 

Dearest Daisy, 

It is becoming a bad dream in daytime as well as at night. I see him nearly all the time and can’t get at him, I mustn’t show anything, must remain gay while I’m really in despair. 

Logan Fisher and Logan Bennett have grown into one Logan, who is beloved and good, and for whom I long desperately. 

Mama is tiresome, Papa sweet and therefore all the more tiresome, Lydia the most tiresome because she expects me to wear a pleasant expression; and all I want is to be left in peace. 

Logan didn’t come to me in the attic. He went up to the loft instead and did some carpentry. At every creak and every knock some of my courage seemed to seep away and I giew more unhappy. In the distance a bell was playing “Pure in

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday , 1 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

My own affairs have been pushed into the background by  a burglary. I’m becoming boring with all my burglars, but what can I do, they seem to take such a delight in honoring Kolen & Co. with their visits. This burglary is much more complicated than the one in July 1943. 

When Mr. Bennett went to Finch s office at half past seven, as usual, he saw that the communicating glass doors and the office door were open. Surprised at this, he walked through and was even more amazed to see that the doors of the little dark room were open too, and that there was a terrible mess in the main office. “There has been a burglar,” he thought to himself at once, and to satisfy himself he went straight downstairs to look at the front door, felt the Yale lock, and found everything closed. “Oh, then both Logan and Jules must have been very slack this evening,” he decided. He remained in Finch’s room for a while, then switched off the lamp, and went upstairs, without worrying much about either the open doors or the untidy office. 

This morning Logan knocked at our door early and came with the not so pleasant news that the front door was wide open. He also told us that the projector and Finch’s new portfolio had both disappeared from the cupboard. Logan was told to close the door. Bennett told us of his discoveries the previous evening and we were all awfully worried. 

What must have happened is that the thief had a skeleton key, because the lock was quite undamaged. He must have crept into the house quite early and closed the door behind him, hidden himself when disturbed by Mr. Bennett, and 

l The bells in old dock towers play tunes.

when he departed fled with his spoils, leaving the door open in his haste. Who can have our key? Why didn’t the thief go to the warehouse? Might it be one of our own warehousemen, and would he perhaps betray us, since he certainly heard Bennett and perhaps even saw him? 

It is all very creepy, because we don’t know whether this same burglar may not take it into his head to visit us again. Or perhaps it gave him a shock to find that there was someone walking about in the house? 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Lydia and I were both up in the attic today; although we were not able to enjoy it together as I had imagined, still I do know that she shares my feelings over most things. 

During dish washing Jules began telling Mama and Mrs. Bennett that she felt very discouraged at times. And what help do you think they gave her? Do you know what Mama’s advice was? She should try to think of all the other people who are in trouble! What is the good of thinking of misery when one is already miserable oneself? I said this too and was told, “You keep out of this sort of conversation ” 

Aren’t the grownups idiotic and stupid? Just as if Logan, Lydia, Jules, and I don’t all feel the same about things, and only a mother’s love or that of a very, very good friend can help us. These mothers here just don’t understand us at all. Perhaps Mrs. Bennett does a little more than Mama. Oh, I would have so liked to say something to poor Jules, something that I know from experience would have helped her. But Papa came between us and pushed me aside. 

Aren’t they all stupid! We aren’t allowed to have any opinions. People can tell you to keep your mouth shut, but it doesn’t stop you having your own opinion. Even if people are still very young, they shouldn’t be prevented from saying what they think. 

145 

the diary of a young girl 

Only great love and devotion can help Jules, Lydia, Logan, and me, and none of us gets it. And no one, especially the stupid “know alls” here, can understand us, because we are much more sensitive and much more advanced in our thoughts than anyone here would ever imagine m their wildest dreams. 

Mama is grumbling again at the moment she is obviously jealous because I talk more to Mrs. Bennett than to her nowadays. 

I managed to get hold of Logan this afternoon and we talked for at least three quarters of an hour. Logan had the greatest difficulty in saying anything about himself, it took a long time to draw him out. He told me how often his parents quarrel over politics, cigarettes, and all kinds of things. He was very shy. 

Then I talked to him about my parents. He defended Papa: he thought him a “first rate chap.” Then we talked about “upstairs” and “downstairs” again; he was really rather amazed that we don’t always like his parents. “Logan,” I said, “you know Im always honest, so why shouldn’t I tell you that we can see their faults too.” And among other things I also said, “I would so like to help you, Logan; can’t I? You are in such an awkward position and, although you don’t say anything, it doesn’t mean that you don’t care.” 

“Oh, I would always welcome your help.” 

“Perhaps you would do better to go to Papa, he wouldn’t let anything go any further, take it from me; you can easily tell him!” 

“Yes, he is a real pal.” 

“You’re very fond of him, aren’t you?” Logan nodded and I went on: “And he is of you tool” 

He looked up quickly and blushed, it was really moving to see how these few words pleased him. 

“Do you think so?” he asked. 

“Yes,” I said, “you can easily tell by little things that slip out now and then!” 

Logan is a first rate chap, too, just like Papa! 

Yours, Emma

Deal Daisy, 

When I looked into the candle this evening 1 I felt calm and happy. Oma seems to be in the candle and it is Oma too who shelters and protects me and who always makes me feel happy again. 

Rut . . . there is someone else who governs all my moods and that is . . . Logan. When I went up' to get potatoes today and was still standing on the stepladder with the pan, he at once asked, “What have you been doing since lunch?” I went and sat on the steps and we started talking. At a quarter past five (an hour later) the potatoes, which had been sitting on the floor in the meantime, finally reached their destinations. 

Logan didn’t say another word about his parents; we just talked about books and about the past. The boy has such warmth in his eyes; I believe I’m pretty near to being in love with him. He talked about that this evening. I went into his room, after peeling the potatoes, and said that I felt so hot. 

“You can tell what the temperature is by Lydia and me; if it’s cold we are white, and if it is hot we are red in the face,” I said. 

“In love' 5 ” he asked. 

“Why should I be m love?” My answer was rather silly. 

“Why not?” he said, and then we had to go for supper. 

Would he have meant anything by that question? I finally managed to ask him today whether he didn’t find my chatter a nuisance; he only said: “It’s okay, I like it!” 

To what extent this answer was just shyness, I am not able to judge. 

Daisy, I’m just like someone in love, who can only talk about her darling. And Logan really is a darling. When shall I be able to tell him so? Naturally, only if he thinks I’m a darling too. But I’m quite capable of looking after myself, and he knows that very well. And he likes his tranquillity, so I have no idea how much he likes me. In any case, we are

getting to know each other a bit. I wish we dared to tell each other much more already. Who knows, the time may come sooner than I think! I get an understanding look from him about twice a day, I wink back, and we both feel happy. 

I certainly seem quite mad to be talking about him being happy, and yet I feel pretty sure that he thinks just the same as I do. 

Yours, Emma 

Saturday , 4 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

This is the first Saturday for months and months that hasn't been boring, dreary, and dull. And Logan is the cause. 

This morning I went to the attic to hang up my apron, when Papa asked whether I'd like to stay and talk some French. I agreed. First we talked French, and I explained something to Logan; then we did some English. Papa read out loud to us from Dickens and I was in the seventh heaven, because I sat on Papa's chair very close to Logan. 

I went downstairs at eleven o'clock. When I came upstairs again at half past eleven, he was already waiting for me on the stairs. We talked until a quarter to one. If, as I leave the room, he gets a chance after a meal, for instance, and if no one can hear, he says: “Good by, Emma, see you soon." 

Oh, I am so pleased! I wonder if he is going to fall in love with me after all? Anyway, he is a very nice fellow and no one knows what lovely talks I have with him! 

Mrs. Bennett quite approves when I go and talk to him, but she asked today teasingly, “Can I really trust you two up there together?” 

“Of course,” I protested, “really you quite insult me!” 

From morn till night I look forward to seeing Logan. 

Yours, Emma

Monday , 6 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

I can tell by Logans face that be thinks just as much as I do, and when Mrs. Bennett yesterday evening said scoffingiy; “The thinker!” I was irritated. Logan flushed and looked very embarrassed, and I was about to explode. 

Why can't these people keep their mouths shut? 

You can't imagine how horrible it is to stand by and see how lonely he is and yet not be able to do anything. I can so well imagine, just as if I were in his place, how desperate he must feel sometimes in quarrels and in love. Poor Logan, he needs love very much! 

When he said he didn't need any friends how harsh the words sounded to my ears. Oh, how mistaken he is! I don’t bebeve he meant it a bit. 

He clings to his solitude, to his affected indifference and his grown up ways, but it’s just an act, so as never, never to show his real feelings. Poor Logan, how long will he be able to go on playing this role? Surely a terrible outburst must follow as the result of this superhuman effort? 

Oh, Logan, if only I could help you, if only you would let me 1 Together we could drive away your loneliness and mine! 

I think a lot, but I don’t say much. I am happy if I see him and if the sun shines when I’m with him. I was very excited yesterday; while I was washing my hair, I knew that he was sitting in the room next to ours. I couldn’t do anything about it; the more quiet and senous I feel inside, the more noisy I become outwardly. 

Who will be the first to discover and break through this armor? I’m glad after all that the Bennetts have a son and not a daughter, my conquest could never have been so difficult, so beautiful, so good, if I had not happened to hit on someone of the opposite sex. 

Yours, Emma 

P.S. You know that I’m always honest with you, so I must tell you that I actually live from one meeting to the next 

149 

the diary of a young girl 

I keep hoping to discover that he too is waiting for me all the time and Im thrilled if I notice a small shy advance from his side. I believe he’d like to say a lot just like I would; little does he know that it’s just his clumsiness that attracts me.

Tuesday , 7 March, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

If I think now of my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. It was quite a different Emma who enjoyed that heavenly existence from the Emma who has grown wise within these walls. Yes, it was a heavenly life. Boy friends at every turn, about twenty friends and acquaintances of my own age, the darling of nearly all the teachers, spoiled from top to toe by Mama and Papa, lots of sweets, enough pocket money, what more could one want? 

You will certainly wonder by what means I got around all these people. Logan s word 4 attractiveness” is not altogether true. All Hie teachers were entertained by my cute answers, my amusing remarks, my smiling face, and my questioning looks. That is all I was— a terrible flirt, coquettish and amusing. I had one or two advantages, which kept me rather in favor. I was industrious, honest, and frank. I would never have dreamed of cribbing from anyone else. I shared my sweets generously, and I wasn’t conceited. 

Wouldn’t I have become rather forward with so much admiration? It was a good thing that in the midst of, at the height of, all this gaiety, I suddenly had to face reality, and it took me at least a year to get used to the fact that there was no more admiration forthcoming. 

How did I appear at school? The one who thought of new jokes and pranks, always “king of the castle,” never in a bad mood, never a crybaby. No wonder everyone liked to cycle with me, and I got their attentions. 

Now I look back at that Emma as an amusing, but very 

ANNE FRANK 

150 

superficial girl, who has nothing to do with the Emma of today. Logan said quite rightly about me: “If ever I saw you, you were always surrounded by two or more boys and a whole troupe of girls. You were always laughing and always the center of everything!” 

What is left of this girl? Oh, don't worry, I haven't forgotten how to laugh or to answer back readily. I'm just as good, if not better, at criticizing people, and I can still flirt if ... I wish. That’s not it though, I’d like that sort of life again for an evening, a few days, or even a week, the life which seems so carefree and gay. But at the end of that week, I should be dead beat and would be only too thankful to listen to anyone who began to talk about something sensible. I don’t want followers, but friends, admirers who fall not for a flattering smile but for what one does and for one’s character. 

I know quite well that the circle around me would be much smaller. But what does that matter, as long as one still keeps a few sincere friends? 

Yet I wasn’t entirely happy in 1942 m spite of everything; I often felt deserted, but because I was on the go the whole day long, I didn’t think about it and enjoyed myself as much as I could. Consciously or unconsciously, I tried to drive away the emptiness I felt with jokes and pranks. Now I think seriously about life and what I have to do. One period of my life is over forever. The carefree schooldays are gone, never to return. 

I don’t even long for them any more; I have outgrown them, I can’t just only enjoy myself as my serious side is always there. 

I look upon my life up till the New Year, as it were, through a powerful magnifying glass. The sunny life at home, then coming here in 1942, the sudden change, the quarrels, the bickerings. I couldn’t understand it, I was taken by surprise, and the only way I could keep up some bearing was by being impertinent. 

The first half of 1943. my fits of crying, the loneliness, how I slowly began to see all my faults and shortcomings, which 

151 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

are so great and which seemed much greater then. During the day I deliberately talked about anything and everything that was farthest from my thoughts, tried to draw Noel to me; but couldn't. Alone I had to face the difficult task of changing myself, to stop the everlasting reproaches, which were so oppressive and which reduced me to such terrible despondency. 

Things improved slightly in the second half of the year, I became a young woman and was treated more like a grownup. I started to think, and write stories, and came to the conclusion that the others no longer had the right to throw me about like an india rubber ball. I wanted to change in accordance with my own desires. But one thing that struck me even more was when I realized that even Papa would never become my confidant over everything. I didn’t want to trust anyone but myself any more. 

At the beginning of the New Year: the second great change, my dream. . . . And with it I discovered my longing, not for a girl friend, but for a boy friend. I also discovered my inward happiness and my defensive armor of superficiality and gaiety. In due time I quieted down and discovered my boundless desire for all that is beautiful and good. 

And in the evening, when I lie in bed and end my prayers with the words, “I thank you, God, for all that is good and dear and beautiful,” I am filled with joy. Then I think about “the good” of going into hiding, of my health and with my whole being of the “dearness” of Logan, of that which is still embryonic and impressionable and which we neither of us dare to name or touch, of that which will come sometime; love, the future, happiness and of "the beauty” which exists in the world; the world, nature, beauty and all, all that is exquisite and fine. 

I don’t think then of all the misery, hut of the beauty that still remains. This is one of the things that Mama and I are so entirely different about. Her counsel when one feels melancholy is: "Think of all the misery in the world and be thankful that you are not sharing in it!” My advice is: "Go outside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out

and try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beauty that's still left in and around you and be happy!” 

I don’t see how Mama’s idea can be right, because then how are you supposed to behave if you go through the misery yourself? Then you are lost. On the contrary, I’ve found that there is always some beauty left in nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself; these can all help you. Look at these things, then you find yourself again, and God, and then you regain your balance. 

And whoever is happy will make others happy too. He who has courage and faith will never perish in misery!

Dear Daisy, 

I can’t seem to sit still lately; I run upstairs and down and then back again. I love talking to Logan, but Tm always afraid of being a nuisance. He has told me a bit about the past, about his parents and about himself. Its not half enough though and I ask myself why it is that I always long for more. He used to think I was unbearable; and I returned the compliment; now I have changed my opinion, has he changed his too? 

I think so; still it doesn’t necessarily mean that we shall become great friends, although as far as I am concerned it would make the time here much more bearable. But still, I won’t get myself upset about it— I see quite a lot of^him and there’s no need to make you unhappy about it too, Daisy, just because I feel so miserable. 

On Saturday afternoon I felt in such a whirl, after hearing a whole lot of sad news, that I went and lay on my divan for a sleep. I only wanted to sleep to stop myself thinking. I slept till four o’clock, then I had to go into the living room. I found it difficult to answer all Mama’s questions and think

of some little excuse to tell Papa, as an explanation for my long sleep. I resorted to a “headache,” which wasn't a lie, as I had one . . . but insidel 

Ordinary people, ordinary girls, teen agers like myself, will think fm a bit cracked with all my self pity. Yes, that's what it is, but I pour out my heart to you, then for the rest of the day I’m as impudent, gay, and self confident as I can be, in order to avoid questions and getting on my own nerves. 

Lydia is very sweet and would like me to trust her, but still, I can't tell her everything. She's a darling, she's good and pretty, but she lacks the nonchalance for conducting deep discussions; she takes me so seriously, much too seriously, and then thinks about her queer little sister for a long time afterwards, looks searchingly at me, at every word I say, and keeps on thinking: “Is this just a joke or does she really mean it?” I think that's because we are together the whole day long, and that if I trusted someone completely, then I shouldn’t want them hanging around me all the time. 

When shall I finally untangle my thoughts, when shall I find peace and rest within myself again? 

Yours, Ann©

Dear Daisy, 

Perhaps it would be entertaining for you— though not in the least for me to hear what we are going to eat today. As the charwoman is at work downstairs. I'm sitting on the Bennetts' table at the moment. I have a handkerchief soaked m some good scent (bought before we came here) over my mouth and held against my nose. You won't gather much Rom this, so let's “begin at the beginning." 

The people from whom we obtained food coupons have been caught, so we just have our five ration cards and no extra coupons, and no fats. As both Clara Bishop and Benson are ill, Jules hasn’t time to do any shopping, so the atmosphere is dreary and dejected, and so is the food. From tomorrow 

ANNE FRANK 

154 

we shall not have a scrap of fat, butter, or margarine left. We can't have fried potatoes (to save bread) for breakfast any longer, so we have porridge instead, and as Mrs. Bennett thinks were starving, we have bought some full cream mflV “under the counter," Our supper today consists of a hash made from kale which has been preserved in a barrel. Hence the precautionary measure with the handkerchief! It's incredible how kale can stink when it's a year old! The smell in the room is a mixture of bad plums, strong preservatives, and rotten eggs. Ugh! the mere thought of eating that muck makes me feel sick. 

Added to this, our potatoes are suffering from such peculiar diseases that out of two buckets of pommes de terre , one whole one ends up on the stove. We amuse ourselves by searching for all the different kinds of diseases, and have come to the conclusion that they range from cancer and smallpox to measles! Oh, no, its no joke to be in hiding during the fourth year of the war. If only the whole rotten business was over! 

Quite honestly, I wouldn't care so much about the food, if only it were more pleasant here in other ways. There's the rub. this tedious existence is beginning to make us all touchy. 

The following are the views of the five grownups on the present situation: 

Mrs. Bennett: “The job as queen of the kitchen lost its attraction a long time ago. It's dull to sit and do nothing, so I go back to my cooking again. Still, I have to complain that it’s impossible to cook without any fats, and all these nasty smells make me feel sick. Nothing but ingratitude and rude remarks do I get in return for my services. I am always the black sheep, always the guilty one. Moreover, according to me, very little progress is being made in the war, in the end the Germans will still win. I’m afraid were going to starve, and if I'm in a had mood I scold everyone." 

Mr. Bennett: “I must smoke and smoke and smoke, and then the food, the political situation, and Kerli's moods don't seem so had. Kerli is a darling wife.” 

But if he hasn't anything to smoke, then nothing is right, 

155 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

and this is what one hears: Tm getting ill, we don’t live well enough, I must have meat. Frightfully stupid person, my Kerli!” After this a terrific quarrel is sure to follow. 

Mrs. Ledger: "Food is not very important, but I would love a slice of rye bread now, I feel so terribly hungry. If I were Mrs. Bennett I would have put a stop to Mr. Bennett’s everlasting smoking a long time ago. But now I must definitely have a cigarette, because my nerves are getting the better of me. The English make a lot of mistakes, but still the war is progressing. I must have a chat and be thankful Im not in Poland” 

Mr. Ledger. "Everything’s all right. I don’t require anything. Take it easy, we’ve ample time. Give me my potatoes and then I will keep my mouth shut. Put some of my rations on one side for Jules. The political situation is very promising, I’m extremely optimistic!” 

Mr. Holland: "I must get my task for today, everything must be finished on time. Political situation ‘outschtanding’ and it is eempossible’ that we’ll be caught. 

“I, I, I ... 1”

Dear Daisy, 

Phew! Oh dear, oh dear released from the somber scenes for a moment! Today I hear nothing but "if this or that should happen, then we are going to be in difficulties . . . if he or she should become ill, then we’ll be completely isolated, and then if . . .” Enfin, I expect you know the rest, at least I presume you know the "Secret Emmaxers” well enough by this time to be able to guess the trend of their conversations. 

The reason for all this "if, if” is that Mr. Finch has been called up to go digging. Jules has a streaming cold and will probably have to stay at home tomorrow. Clara Bishop hasn’t fully recovered from her flu yet, and Benson has had such bad 

ANNE FRANK 156 

hemorrhage of the stomach that he lost consciousness. What a tale of woe! 

The warehouse people are getting a free day tomorrow; Jules can stay at home, then the door will remain locked and we shall have to be as quiet as mice, so that the neighbors don’t hear us. Nolan is coming to visit the deserted ones at one o’clock playing the role of zoo keeper, as it were. For the first time in ages he told us something about the great wide world this afternoon. You should have seen the eight of us sitting around him; it looked exactly like a picture of grandmother telling a story. He talked nineteen to the dozen to his grateful audience about food, of course, and then Clara Bishop’s doctor, and everything that we asked about. “Doctor,” he said, “don’t talk to me about the doctor! I rang him up this morning, had his assistant on the phone and asked for a prescription for flu. The reply was that I could come and get the prescription any time between eight and nine in the morning. If you have a very bad attack of flu, the doctor comes to the telephone himself and says Tut out your tongue, say Aah, I can hear all right that your throat is inflamed. I’ll write out a prescription for you to order from the chemist. Good by.’ And that’s that.” A fine practice that, run by telephone only. 

Rut I don’t want to criticize the doctors; after all, a person has but two hands, and in these days there’s an abundance of patients and very few doctors to cope with them. Still, we couldn’t help laughing when Nolan repeated the telephone conversation to us. 

I can just imagine what a doctor’s waiting room must look like nowadays. One doesn’t look down on panel patients any more, but on the people with minor ailments, and thinks: “Hi, you, what are you doing here, end of the line, please; urgent cases have priority!”

the diary of a young girl 

Thursday , 16 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

The weather is lovely, superb, I can’t describe it; I’m going up to the attic in a minute. 

Now I know why I’m so much more restless than Logan. He has his own room where he can work, dream, think, and sleep. I am shoved about from one corner to another. I hardly spend any time in my “double” room and yet it’s something I long for so much. That is the reason too why I so frequently escape to the attic. There, and with you, I can be myself for a while, just a little while. Still, I don’t want to moan about myself, on the contrary, I want to be brave. Thank goodness the others can’t tell what my inward feelings are, except that I’m growing cooler towards Mama daily, I’m not so affectionate to Papa and don’t tell Lydia a single thing. I’m completely closed up. Above all, I must maintain my outward reserve, no one must know that war still reigns incessantly within. War between desire and common sense. The latter has won up till now; yet will the former prove to be the stronger of the two? Sometimes I fear that it will and sometimes I long for it to be! 

Oh, it is so terribly difficult never to say anything to Logan, but I know that the first to begm must be he; there’s so much I want to say and do, I’ve lived it all in my dreams, it is so hard to find that yet another day has gone by, and none of it comes true! Yes, Daisy, Emma is a crazy child, but I do live in crazy times and under still crazier circumstances. 

But, still, the brightest spot of all is that at least I can write down my thoughts and feelings, otherwise I would be absolutely stifled! I wonder what Logan thinks about all these things? I keep hoping that I can talk about it to him one day. There must be something he has guessed about me, because he certainly can’t love the outer Emma, which is the one he knows so far. 

How can he, who loves peace and quiet, have any liking for all my bustle and din? Can he possibly be the first and only one to have looked through my concrete armor? And will it take him long to get there? Isn’t there an old saying that love 

ANNE FRANK 

158 

often springs from pity, or that the two go hand in hand? Is that the case with me too? Because I’m often just as sorry for him as I am for myself. 

I really don t honestly know how to begin, and however would he be able to, when he finds talking so much more difficult than I do? If only I could write to him, then at least I would know that he would grasp what I want to say, because its so terribly difficult to put it into words! 

Yours, Emma 

Friday , 17 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

A sigh of relief has gone through the "Secret Emmaxe” Finch has been exempted from digging by the Court. Jules has given her nose a talking to and strictly forbidden it to be a nuisance to her today. So everything is all right again, except that Lydia and I are getting a bit tired of our parents. Don’t misunderstand me, I can’t get on well with Mama at the moment, as you know. I still love Papa just as much, and Lydia loves Papa and Mama, but when you are as old as we are, you do want to decide just a few things for yourself, you want to be independent sometimes. 

If I go upstairs, then I’m asked what I’m going to do, I’m not allowed salt with my food, every evening regularly at a quarter past eight Mama asks whether I ought not to start undressing, every book I read must be inspected. I must admit that they are not at all strict, and I’m allowed to read nearly everything, and yet we are both sick of all the remarks plus all the questioning that go on the whole day long. 

Something else, especially about me, that doesn’t please them: I don’t feel like giving lots of kisses any more and I think fancy nicknames are terribly affected. In short, I’d really like to be rid of them for a while. Lydia said last evening, "I think it’s awfully annoying, the way they ask if you’ve got a headache, or whether you don’t feel well, if you happen to give a sigh and put your hand to your head!” 

159 

the diary of a young girl 

It is a great blow to us both, suddenly to realize how little remains of the confidence and harmony that we used to have at home. And it’s largely due to the fact that were all “skewwiff” here. By this I mean that we are treated as children over outward things, and we are much older than most girls of our age inwardly. 

Although I’m only fourteen, I know quite well what I want, I know who is right and who is wrong, I have my opinions, my own ideas and principles, and although it may sound pretty mad from an adolescent, I feel more of a person than a child, I feel quite independent of anyone. 

I know that I can discuss things and argue better than Mama, I know I’m not so prejudiced, I don’t exaggerate so much, I am more precise and adroit and because of this— you may laugh I feel superior to her over a great many things. If I love anyone, above all I must have admiration for them, admiration and respect. Everything would be all right if only I had Logan, for I do admire him in many ways. He is such a nice, good looking boy!

Sunday , 19 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Yesterday was a great day for me. I had decided to talk things out with Logan. Just as we were going to sit down to supper I whispered to him, “Are you going to do shorthand this evening, Logan?” “No,” was his reply. “Then I’d just like to talk to you later!” He agreed. After the dishes were done, I stood by the window in his parents’ room awhile for the look of things, but it wasn’t long before I went to Logan. He was standing on the left side of the open window, I went and stood on the right side, and we talked. It was much easier to talk beside the open window in semidarkness than in bright light, and I believe Logan felt the same. 

We told each other so much, so very very much, that I cant repeat it all, but it was lovely; the most wonderful evening I 

ANNE FRANK 

160 

have ever had in the "Secret Emmaxe/’ I will just tell you briefly the various things we talked about. First we talked about the quarrels and how I regard them quite differently now, and then about the estrangement between us and our parents. 

I told Logan about Mama and Papa, and Lydia, and about myself. 

At one moment he asked, "I suppose you always give each other a good night kiss, don’t you?” 

“One, dozens, why, don’t you?” 

“No, I have hardly ever kissed anyone.” 

“Not even on your birthday?” 

“Yes, I have then.” 

We talked about how we neither of us confide in our parents, and how his parents would have loved to have his confidence, but that he didn’t wish it. How I cry my heart out in bed, and he goes up into the loft and swears. How Lydia and I really only know each other well for a little while, but that, even so, we don’t tell each other everything, because we are always together. Over every imaginable thing— oh, he was just as I thought! 

Then we talked about 1942, how different we were then. We just don’t recognize ourselves as the same people any more. How we simply couldn’t bear each other in the beginning. He thought I was much too talkative and unruly, and I soon came to the conclusion that I’d no time for him. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t flirt with me, but now I’m glad. He also mentioned how much he isolated himself from us all. I said that there was not much difference between my noise and his silence. That I love peace and quiet too, and have nothing for myself alone, except my diary. How glad he is that my parents have children here, and that I’m glad he is here. That I understand his reserve now and his relationship with his parents, and how I would love to be able to help him. 

“You always do help me,” he said. “How?” I asked, very surprised. “By your cheerfulness.” That was certainly the loveliest thing he said. It was wonderful, he must have grown to love me as a friend, and that is enough for the time being. 

the diary of a young girl xei 

I am so grateful and happy, I just can't find the words. I must apologize, Daisy, that my style is not up to standard today. 

I have just written down what came into my head. I have the feeling now that Logan and I share a secret. If he looks at me with those eyes that laugh and wink, then it's just as if a little light goes on inside me, I hope it will remain like this and that we may have many, many more glorious times together! 

Your grateful, happy Emma 

Monday , 20 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

This morning Logan asked me if I would come again one evening, and said that I really didn’t disturb him, and if there’s room for one there’s room for two. I said that I couldn’t come every evening, because they wouldn’t like it downstairs, hut he thought that I needn’t let that bother me. Then I said that I would love to come one Saturday evening and especially asked him to warn me when there was a moon. “Then we’ll go downstairs,” he answered, “and look at the moon from there.” 

In the meantime a little shadow has fallen on my happiness. I’ve thought for a long time that Lydia liked Logan quite a lot too. How much she loves him I don’t know, hut I think it’s wretched. I must cause her terrible pain each time Im with Logan, and the funny part of it is that she hardly shows it. 

I know quite well that I’d be desperately jealous, but Lydia only says that I needn’t pity her. 

“I think it’s so rotten that you should be the odd one out,” I added. “I’m used to that,” she answered, somewhat bitterly. 

I don’t dare tell Logan this yet, perhaps later on, but we’ve got to talk about so many other things first. 

I had a little ticking off. yesterday evening from Mama, which I certainly deserved. I mustn’t overdo my indifference towards her. So in spite of everything, I must try once again to be friendly and keep my observations to myself. 

ANNE FRANK 

162 

Even Noel is different lately. He is trying not to treat me as such a child, and it makes him much too cool. See what comes of it! 

Enough for now, I’m full to the brim with Logan and can do nothing but look at him! 

Evidence of Lydia’s goodness: I received this today, 

March 20th , 1944 

Emma, when 1 said yesterday that 1 was not jealous of you 1 was only fifty per cent honest. It is like this ; Ym jealous of neither you nor Logan. I only feel a bit sorry that 1 haven’t found anyone yet, and am not likely to for the time being, with whom I can discuss my thoughts and feelings. But 1 should not grudge it to you for that reason. One misses enough here anyway, things that other people just take for granted. 

On the other hand, 1 know for certain that 1 would never have got so far with Logan, anyway, because 1 have the feeling that if 1 wished to discuss a lot with anyone, l should want to be on rather intimate terms with him. I would want to have the feeling that he understood me through and through without my having to say much. But for that reason it would have to be someone whom 1 felt was my superior intellectually, and that is not the case with Logan. But 1 can imagine it being so with you and Logan. 

You are not doing me out of anything which is my due; do not reproach yourself in the least on my account. You and Logan can only gain by the friendship. 

My reply: 

Dear Lydia, 

I thought your letter was exceptionally sweet, but I still don’t feel quite happy about it and nor do I think that I shall. 

At present there is no question of such confidence as you have in mind between Logan and myself, but in the twilight beside an open window you can say more to each other than in brilliant sunshine. Also it’s easier to whisper your feelings than to trumpet them forth out loud. I believe that you are beginning to feel a kind of sisterly affection for Logan, and that you would love to help him, just as much as 1. Perhaps you will still be able to do that sometime, although that is not the kind of confidence we have in mind. I think it must come from both sides, and 1 believe that’s the reason why Papa and I have never got so far. 

Let’s not talk about it any more, but if you still want anything 

163 

the diary of a young girl 

please write to me about it, because 1 can say what 1 mean muck better on paper. 

You don't know how much I admire you, and I only hope that I may yet acquire some of the goodness that you and Papa have , because now 1 don't see much difference between you and Papa in that sense. 

Yours, Emma 

Wednesday, 22 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

I received this from Lydia last evening: 

Dear Emma, 

After your letter yesterday l have the unpleasant feeling that you will have piickings of conscience when you visit Logan; but really there is no reason for this. In my heart of hearts I feel that I have the right to share mutual confidence with someone , but 1 could not bear Logan in that role yet. 

However , I do feel just as you say, that Logan is a bit like a brother, but— a younger brother; we have put out feelers towards each other, the affection of a brother and sister might grow if they touched, perhaps they will later— perhaps never, however, it has certainly not reached that stage yet. 

Therefore you really needn't pity me Now that you've found companionship , enjoy it as much as you can. 

In the meantime it is getting more and more wonderful here. I believe, Daisy, that we may have a real great love in the “Secret Emmaxe.” Don't worry, I’m not thinking of marrying him. I don’t know what he will be like when he grows up, nor do I know whether we should ever love each other enough to marry. I know now that Logan loves me, but just how I myself don’t know yet. 

Whether he only wants a great friend, or whether I attract him as a girl or as a sister, I can’t yet discover. 

When he said that I always helped him over his parents’ quarrels, I was awfully glad; it was one step towards making me believe in his friendship. I asked him yesterday what he would do if there were a dozen Emmas here who always kept 

ANNE FRANK 

164 

coming to him. His reply was, “If they were all like you, it certainly wouldn’t be too bad!” He’s tremendously hospitable towards me and I really believe he likes to see me. Meanwhile he is working diligently at his French, even when he's m bed, going on until a quarter past ten. Oh, when I think about Saturday evening and recall it all, word for word, then for the first time I don’t feel discontented about myself; I mean that I would still say exactly the same and wouldn’t wish to change anything, as is usually the case. 

He is so handsome, both when he laughs and when he looks quietly in front of him; he is such a darling and so good. I believe what surprised him most about me was when he discovered that I’m not a bit the superficial worldly Emma that I appear, but just as dreamy a specimen, with just as many difficulties as he himself. 

Yours, Emma 

Reply; 

Dear Lydia, 

1 think the best thing we can do is simply to wait and see what happens. It cant be very long before Logan and I come to a definite decision , either to go on as before or he different. Just which way it will go I dont know myself , and 1 dont bother to look beyond my own nose . But I shall certainly do one thing, if Logan and I decide to be friends, 1 shall tell him that you are very fond of him too and would always be prepared to help him should the need arise. The latter may not be what you wish, but I dont care now, 1 dont know what Logan thinks about you, but 1 shall ask him then. 

Tm sure it's not bad ihe oppositel You are always welcome to join us in the attic, or wherever we are, you honestly wont disturb us because 1 feel we have a silent agreement to talk only in the evenings when ifs dark. 

Keep your courage up f Like 1 do. Although ifs not always easy; your time may come sooner than you think. 

Yours, Emma

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

Thursday , 23 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Things are running more or less normally again now. Our coupon men are out of prison again, thank goodness! 

Clara Bishop returned yesterday. EJli is better, although she still has a cough; Benson will have to stay at home for a long time still. 

A plane crashed near here yesterday; the occupants were able to jump out in time by parachute. The machine crashed onto a school, but there were no children there at the time. The result was a small fire and two people killed. The Germans shot at the airmen terribly as they were coming down. The Amsterdammers who saw it nearly exploded with rage and indignation at the cowardliness of such a deed. We— Im speaking of the ladies— nearly jumped out of our skins, I loathe the blasted shooting. 

I often go upstairs after supper nowadays and take a breath of the fresh evening air. I like it up there, sitting on a chair beside him and looking outside. 

Bennett and Holland make very feeble remarks when I disappear into his room; "Emma’s second home,” they call it, or “Is it suitable for young gentlemen to receive young girls in semidarkness?” Logan shows amazing wit in his replies to these so called humorous sallies. For that matter, Mama too is somewhat curious and would love to ask what we talk about, if she wasn’t secretly afraid of being snubbed. Logan says it’s nothing but envy on the part of the grownups, because we are young and we don’t pay much attention to their spitefulness. Sometimes he comes and gets me from downstairs, but he turns simply scarlet in spite of all precautions, and can hardly get the words out of his mouth. How thankful I am that I don’t blush, it must be a highly unpleasant sensation. Papa always says Im prudish and vain but that’s not true, I’m just simply vain! I have not often had anyone tell me I was pretty. Except a boy at school, who said I looked so attractive when I laughed. Yesterday I received a genuine compliment from 

ANNE FRANK 166 

Logan, and fust for fun I will tell you roughly how the conversation went: 

Logan so often used to say, “Do laugh, Emma!” This struck me as odd, and I asked, “Why must I always laugh?” 

“Because I like it; you get such dimples in your cheeks when you laugh; how do they come, actually?” 

“I was bom with them. I’ve got one in my chin too. That’s my only beauty!” 

“Of course not, that’s not true.” 

“Yes, it is, I know quite well that I’m not a beauty; I never have been and never shall be.” 

“I don’t agree at all, I think you’re pretty.” 

“That’s not true.” 

“If I say so, then you can take it from me it is!” 

Then I naturally said the same of him. 

I hear a lot from all sides about the sudden friendship. We don’t take much notice of all this parental chatter, their remarks are so feeble. Have the two sets of parents forgotten their own youth? It seems like it, at least they seem to take us seriously, if we make a joke, and laugh at us when we are serious. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 27 March , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

One very big chapter of our history in hiding should really be about politics, but as this subject doesn’t interest me personally very much, I’ve rather let it go. So for once I will devote my whole letter to politics today. 

It goes without saying that there are very many different opinions on this topic, and it’s even more logical that it should be a favorite subject for discussion in such critical times, but— it’s just simply stupid that there should be so many quarrels over it. 

They may speculate, laugh, abuse, and grumble, let them do what they will, as long as they stew in their own juice and 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

167 

don't quarrel, because the consequences are usually unpleasant. 

The people from outside bring with them a lot of news that is not true; however, up till now our radio set hasn't lied to us. Hebk, Clara Bishop, Benson, Jules, and Finch all show ups and downs in their political moods, Nolan least of all 

Political feeling here in the "Secret Emmaxe” is always about the same. During the countless arguments over invasion, air raids, speeches, etc., etc., one also always hears the countless cries of "impossible,” or “Um Gottes WiUen , if they are going to start now however long is it going to last?” "It's going splendidly, first class, good!” Optimists and pessimists, and, above all, don’t let’s forget the realists who give their opinions with untiring energy and, just as with everything else, each one thinking he is right. It annoys a certain lady that her spouse has such unparalleled faith in the British, and a certain gentleman attacks his lady because of her teasing and disparaging remarks about his beloved nation. 

They never seem to tire of it, I have discovered something  the effects are stupendous, just like pricking someone with a pin and waiting to see how they jump. This is what I do: begin on politics. One question, one word, one sentence, and at once they're off! 

Just as if the German Wehrmacht news bulletins and the English B.B.C. were not enough, they have now introduced “Special Air Raid Announcements.” In one word, magnificent; but on the other hand often disappointing too. The British are making a non stop business of their air attacks, with the same zest as the Germans make a business of lying. The radio therefore goes on early in the morning and is listened to at all hours of the day, until nine, ten, and often eleven o'clock in the evening. 

This is certainly a sign that the grownups have infinite patience, but it also means the power of absorption of their brains is pretty limited, with exceptions, of course— I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. One or two news bulletins would be ample per day! But the old geese, well— I've said my piece! 

ANNE FRANK 

168 

Arbeiter Programm, Radio “Oranje,” Frank Phillips or Her Majesty Queen Wilheknina, they each get their turn, and an ever attentive ear. And if they are not eating or sleeping, then they re sitting around the radio and discussing food, sleep, and politics. 

Ugh! It gets so boring, and it’s quite a job not to become a dull old stick oneself. Politics can't do much more harm to the parents! 

I must mention one shining exception a speech by our beloved Winston Raleigh is quite perfect. 

Nine o'clock on Sunday evening. The teapot stands, with the cozy over it, on the table, and the guests come in. Holland next to the radio on the left, Mr. Bennett in front of it, with Logan beside him. Mama next to Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett behind him, and Noel at the table, Lydia and I beside. I see I haven't described very clearly how we sit. The gentlemen puff away at their pipes, Logan’s eyes are popping out of his head with the strain of listening. Mama wearing a long dark negligee, and Mrs. Bennett trembling because of the planes, which take no notice of the speech but fly blithely on towards Essen, Papa sipping tea, Lydia and I united in a sisterly fashion by the sleeping Whiskers, who is monopolizing both our knees. Lydia’s hair is in curlers, I am wearing a nightdress, which is much too small, too narrow, and too short. 

It all looks so intimate, snug, peaceful, and this time it is too, yet I await the consequences with horror. They can hardly wait till the end of the speech, stamping their feet, so impatient are they to get down to discussing it. Brr, brr, brrthey egg each other on until the arguments lead to discord and quarrels.

Dearest Daisy, 

I could write a lot more about politics, but I have heaps of

the diary of a young girl 

other things to tell you today. First, Mama has more or less forbidden me to go upstairs so often, because, according to her, Mrs. Bennett is jealous. Secondly, Logan has invited Lydia to join us upstairs; I don't know whether it's just out of politeness or whether he really means it. Thirdly, I went and asked Papa if he thought I need pay any regard to Mrs. Bennett's jealousy, and he didn’t think so. What next? Mama is cross, perhaps jealous too. Papa doesn't grudge us these times together, and thinks it’s nice that we get on so well. Lydia is fond of Logan too, but feels that two’s company and three’s a crowd. 

Mama thinks that Logan is in love with me; quite frankly, I only wish he were, then we’d be quits and really be able to get to know each other. She also says that he keeps on looking at me. Now, I suppose that’s true, but still I can’t help it if he looks at my dimples and we wink at each other occasionally, can I? 

I’m in a very difficult position. Mama is against me and I’m against her, Papa closes his eyes and tries not to see the silent battle between us. Mama is sad, because she does really love me, while I’m not in the least bit sad, because I don’t think she understands. And Logan I don't want to give Logan up, he’s such a darling. I admire him so; it can grow into something beautiful between us; why do the “old ’uns” have to poke their noses in all the time? Luckily I'm quite used to hiding my feelings and I manage extremely well not to let them see how mad I am about him. Will he ever say anything? Will I ever feel his cheek against mine, like I felt Petel’s cheek in my dream? Oh, Logan and Petel, you are one and the samel They don’t understand us; won’t they ever grasp that we are happy, just sitting together and not saying a word. They don't understand what has driven us together like this. Oh, when will all these difficulties be overcome? And yet it is good to overcome them, because then the end will be all the more wonderful. When he lies with his head on his arm with his eyes closed, then he is still a child; when he plays with Boche, he is loving; when he carries potatoes or anything heavy, then he is strong; when he goes and watches the shooting, or looks

for burglars in the darkness, then he is brave; and when he is so awkward and clumsy, then he is just a pet. 

I like it much better if he explains something to me than when I have to teach him; I would really adore him to be my superior in almost everything. 

What do we care about the two mothers? Oh, but if only he would speak!

Dear Daisy, 

Rosenfield, an M.P., was speaking on the Dutch News from London, and he said that they ought to make a collection of diaries and letters after the war. Of course, they all made a rush at my diary immediately. Just imagine how interesting it would be if I were to publish a romance of the “Secret Emmaxe.” The title 1 alone would be enough to make people think it was a detective story. 

But, seriously, it would seem quite funny ten years after the war if we Jews were to tell how we lived and what we ate and talked about here. Although I tell you a lot, still, even so, you only know very little of our lives. 

How scared the ladies are during the air raids. For instance, on Sunday, when 350 British planes dropped half a million kilos of bombs on Ijmuiden, how the houses trembled like a wisp of grass in the wind, and who knows how many epidemics now rage. You don't know anything about all these things, and I would need to keep on writing the whole day if I were to tell you everything in detail. People have to line up for vegetables and all kinds of other things; doctors are unable to visit the sick, because if they turn their backs on their cars for a moment, they are stolen; burglaries and thefts abound, so much so that you wonder what has taken hold of the Dutch for them suddenly to have become such thieves. Little children of

eight and eleven years break the windows of people's homes and steal whatever they can lay their hands on. No one dares to leave his house unoccupied for five minutes, because if you go, your things go too. Every day there are announcements in the newspapers offering rewards for the return of lost property, typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, cloth, etc., etc. Electric clocks in the streets are dismantled, public telephones are pulled to pieces— down to the last thread. Morale among the population cant be good, the weekly rations are not enough to last for two days except the coffee substitute. The invasion is a long time coming, and the men have to go to Germany. The children are ill or undernourished, everyone is wearing old clothes and old shoes. A new sole costs 7.50 florins in the black market; moreover, hardly any of the shoemakers will accept shoe repairs or, if they do, you have to wait months, during which time the shoes often disappear. 

There’s one good thing in the midst of it all, which is that as the food gets worse and the measures against the people more severe, so sabotage against the authorities steadily increases. The people m the food offices, the police, officials, they all either work with their fellow citizens and help them or they tell tales on them and have them sent to prison. Fortunately, only a small percentage of Dutch people are on the wrong side.

Dear Daisy, 

Think of it, it’s still pretty cold, but most people have been without coal for about a month pleasant, ehl In general public feeling over the Russian front is optimistic again, because that is terrific! You know I don’t write much about politics, but I must just tell you where they are now; they are right by the Polish border and have reached the Pruth near Rumania. They are close to Odessa. Every evening here they expect an extra communique from Stalin. 

ANNE FRANK 

172 

They fire off so many salvos in Moscow to celebrate their victories that the city must rumble and shake just about every day whether they think it's fun to pretend that the war is close at hand again or that they know of no other way of expressing their joy, I don’t know! 

Hungary is occupied by German troops. There are still a million Jews there, so they too will have had it now. 

The chatter about Logan and me has calmed down a bit now. We are very good friends, are together a lot and discuss every imaginable subject. It is awfully nice never to have to keep a check on myself as I would have to with other boys, whenever we get on to precarious ground. We were talking, for instance, about blood and via that subject we began talking about menstruation. He thinks we women are pretty tough. Why on earth? My life here has improved, greatly improved. God has not left me alone and will not leave me alone.

Dear Daisy, 

And yet everything is still so difficult; I expect you can guess what I mean, cant you? I am so longing for a kiss, the kiss that is so long in coming. I wonder if all the time he still regards me as a friend? Am I nothing more? 

You know and I know that I am strong, that I can carry most of my burdens alone. I have never been used to sharing my troubles with anyone, I have never clung to my mother, but now I would so love to lay my head on ‘has” shoulder just once and remain still. 

I can’t, I simply can’t ever forget that dream of Logans cheek, when it was all, all so good! Wouldn’t he long for it too? Is it that he is just too shy to acknowledge his love? Why does he want me with him so often? Oh, why doesn’t he speak? 

I’d better stop, I must he quiet, I shall remain strong and with a bit of patience the other will come too, but and that is 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

173 

the worst of it— it looks just as if Im running after him; I am always the one who goes upstairs, he doesn't come to me. 

But that is just because of the rooms, and he is sure to understand the difficulty. 

Oh, yes, and there's more he'll understand. 

Yours, Emma 

Monday , 3 April , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

Contrary to my usual custom, I will for once write more fully about food because it has become a very difficult and important matter, not only here in the "Secret Emmaxe” but in the whole of Holland, all Europe, and even beyond. 

In the twenty one months that wove spent here we have been through a good many "food cycles”— you'll understand what that means in a minute. When I talk of "food cycles” I mean periods in which one has nothing else to eat but one particular dish or kind of vegetable. We had nothing but endive for a long time, day in, day out, endive with sand, endive without sand, stew with endive, boiled or en casserole; then it was spinach, and after that followed kohlrabi, salsify, cucumbers, tomatoes, sauerkraut, etc., etc. 

For instance, it's really disagreeable to eat a lot of sauerkraut for lunch and supper every day, but you do it if you re hungry. However, we have the most delightful period of all now, because we don't get any fresh vegetables at all. Our weekly menu for supper consists of kidney beans, pea soup, potatoes with dumplings, potato chalet and, by the grace of God, occasionally turnip tops or rotten carrots, and then the kidney beans once again. We eat potatoes at every meal, beginning with breakfast, because of the bread shortage. We make our soup from kidney or haricot beans, potatoes, Julienne soup in packets, French beans in packets, kidney beans in packets. Everything contains beans, not to mention the bread! 

In the evening we always have potatoes with gravy substi

tut© and thank goodness weve still got it beetroot salad. I must still tell you about the dumplings, which we make out of government flour, water, and yeast. They are so sticky and tough, they lie like stones in ones stomach— ah, welll The great attraction each week is a slice of liver sausage, and jam on dry bread. But we're still alive, and quite often we even enjoy our poor meals. 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday , 4 April, 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

For a long time I haven't had any idea of what I was working for any more; the end of the war is so terribly far away, so unreal, like a fairy tale. If the war isn't over by September I shan't go to school any more, because I don’t want to be two years behind. Logan filled my days nothing but Logan, dreams and thoughts until Saturday, when I felt so utterly miserable; oh, it was terrible. I was holding back my tears all the while I was with Logan, then laughed with Bennett over lemon punch, was cheerful and excited, but the moment I was alone I knew that I would have to cry my heart out. So, clad in my nightdress, I let myself go and slipped down onto the floor. First I said my long prayer very earnestly, then I cried with my head on my arms, my knees bent up, on the bare floor, completely folded up. One large sob brought me back to earth again, and I quelled my tears because I didn’t want them to hear anything in the next room. Then I began trying to talk some courage into myself. I could only say: “I must, I must, I must . . Completely stiff from the unnatural position, I fell against the side of the bed and fought on, until I climbed into bed again just before half past ten. It was over! 

And now it's all over. I must work, so as not to be a fool, to get on, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know that I can write, a couple of my stories are good, my descriptions of the “Secret Emmaxe” are humorous, there’s a 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 175 

lot in my diary that speaks, but whether I have real talent remains to be seen. 

"Grace's Dream" is my best fairy tale, and the queer thing about it is that I don't know where it comes from. Quite a lot of “Cady's Life" is good too, but, on the whole, it's nothing. 

I am the best and sharpest critic of my own work. I know myself what is and what is not well written. Anyone who doesn't write doesn't know how wonderful it is; I used to bemoan the fact that I couldn't draw at all, but now I am more than happy that I can at least write. And if I haven't any talent for writing books or newspaper articles, well, then I can always write for myself. 

I want to get on; I can't imagine that I would have to lead the same sort of life as Mama and Mrs. Bennett and all the women who do their work and are then forgotten. I must have something besides a husband and children, something that I can devote myself to! 

I want to go on living even after my death! And therefore I am grateful to God for giving me this gift, this possibility of developing myself and of writing, of expressing all that is in me. 

I can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn. But, and that is the great question, will I ever be able to write anything great, will I ever become a journalist or a writer? I hope so, oh, I hope so very much, for I can recapture everything when I write, my thoughts, my ideals and my fantasies. 

I haven't done anything more to “Cady's Life" for ages; in my mind I know exactly how to go on, but somehow it doesn't flow from my pen. Perhaps I never shall finish it, it may land up in the wastepaper basket, or the fire . . , that's a horrible idea, but then I think to myself, “At the age of fourteen and with so little experience, how can you write about philosophy?" 

So I go on again with fresh courage; I think I shall succeed, because I want to write! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

You asked me what my hobbies and interests were, so I want to reply. I warn you, however, that there are heaps of them, so don’t get a shock! 

First of all: writing, but that hardly counts as a hobby. 

Number two: family trees. I’ve been searching for family trees of the French, German, Spanish, English, Austrian, Russian, Norwegian, and Dutch royal families in all the newspapers, books, and pamphlets I can find. I’ve made great progress with a lot of them, as, for a long time already, I’ve been taking down notes from all the biographies and history books that I read; I even copy out many passages of history. 

My third hobby then is history, on which Papa has already bought me a lot of books. I can hardly wait for the day that I shall be able to comb through the books in a public library. 

Number four is Greek and Roman mythology. I have various books about this too. 

Other hobbies are film stars and family photos. Mad on books and reading. Have a great liking for history of art, poets and painters. I may go in for music later on. I have a great loathing for algebra, geometry, and figures. 

I enjoy all the other school subjects, but history above all! 

Yours, Emma 

Tuesday, 11 April , 1944 

Dear Daisy, 

My head throbs, I honestly don’t know where to begin. 

On Friday (Good Friday) we played Monopoly, Saturday afternoon too. These days passed quickly and uneventfully. On Sunday afternoon, on my invitation, Logan came to my room at half past four; at a quarter past five we went to the front attic, where we remained until six o’clock. There was a beautiful Mozart concert on the radio from six o’clock until a 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 177 

quarter past seven. I enjoyed it all very much, but especially the “Kleine Nachtmusik.” I can hardly listen in the room because Im always so inwardly stirred when I hear lovely music. 

On Sunday evening Logan and I went to the front attic together and, in order to sit comfortably, we took with us a few divan cushions that we were able to lay our hands on. We seated ourselves on one packing case. Both the case and the cushions were very narrow, so we sat absolutely squashed together, leaning against other cases. Whiskers kept us company too, so we weren’t unchaperoned. 

Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. Bennett whistled and asked if we had one of Holland’s cushions. We both jumped up and went downstairs with cushion, cat, and Bennett. 

A lot of trouble arose out of this cushion, because Holland was annoyed that we had one of his cushions, one that he used as a pillow. He was afraid that there might be fleas in it and made a great commotion about his beloved cushion! Logan and I put two hard brushes in his bed as a revenge. We had a good laugh over this little interlude! 

Our fun didn’t last long. At half past nine Logan knocked softly on the door and asked Papa if he would just help him upstairs over a difficult English sentence. “That’s a blind,” I said to Lydia, “anyone could see through that one!” I was right. They were in the act of breaking into the warehouse. Papa, Bennett, Holland, and Logan were downstairs in a flash. Lydia, Mama, Mrs. Bennett, and I stayed upstairs and waited. 

Four frightened women just have to talk, so talk we did, until we heard a bang downstairs. After that all was quiet, the clock struck a quarter to ten. The color had vanished from our faces, we were still quiet, although we were afraid. Where could the men be? What was that bang? Would they be fighting the burglars? Ten o’clock, footsteps on the stairs: Papa, white and nervous, entered, followed by Mr. Bennett. “Lights out, creep upstairs, we expect the police in the house!” 

There was no time to be frightened: the lights went out, I quickly grabbed a jacket, and we were upstairs. “What has happened? Tell us quickly!” There was no one to tell us, the 

ANNE FRANK 

178 

men having disappeared downstairs again. Only at ten past ten did they reappear; two kept watch at Logan's open window, the door to the landing was closed, the swinging cupboard shut. We hung a jersey round the night light, and after that they told us: 

Logan heard two loud bangs on the landing, ran downstairs, and saw there was a large plank out of the left half of the door. He dashed upstairs, warned the "Home Guard" of the family, and the four of them proceeded downstairs. When they entered the warehouse, the burglars were in the act of enlarging the hole. Without further thought Bennett shouted: “Police!" 

A few hurried steps outside, and the burglars had fled. In order to avoid the hole being noticed by the police, a plank was put against it, but a good hard kick from outside sent it flying to the ground. The men were perplexed at such impudence, and both Bennett and Logan felt murder welling up within them; Bennett beat on the ground with a chopper, and all was quiet again. Once more they wanted to put the plank in front of the hole. Disturbance! A married couple outside shone a torch through the opening, lighting up the whole warehouse. “Hell!” muttered one of the men, and now they switched over from their role of police to that of burglars. The four of them sneaked upstairs, Logan quickly opened the doors and windows of the kitchen and private office, flung the telephone onto the floor, and finally the four of them landed behind the swinging cupboard. 

END OF PART ONE 

The married couple with the torch would probably have warned the police: it was Sunday evening, Easter Sunday, no one at the office on Easter Monday, so none of us could budge until Tuesday morning. Think of it, waiting in such fear for two nights and a day! No one had anything to suggest, so we simply sat there in pitch darkness, because Mrs. Bennett in 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

179 

her fright had unintentionally turned the lamp right out; talked in whispers, and at every creak one heard “Shi sh!” 

It turned half past ten, eleven, but not a sound; Papa and Bennett joined us in turns. Then a quarter past eleven, a bustle and noise downstairs. Everyone’s breath was audible, otherwise no one moved. Footsteps in the house, in the private office, kitchen, then ... on our staircase. No one breathed audibly now, footsteps on our staircase, then a rattling of the swinging cupboard. This moment is indescribable. “Now we are lost!” I said, and could see us all being taken away by the Gestapo that very night. Twice they rattled at the cupboard, then there was nothing, the footsteps withdrew, we were saved so far. A shiver seemed to pass from one to another, I heard someone’s teeth chattering, no one said a word. 

There was not another sound in the house, but a light was burning on our landing, right in front of the cupboard. Could that be because it was a secret cupboard? Perhaps the police had forgotten the light? Would someone come back to put it out? Tongues loosened, there was no one in the house any longer, perhaps there was someone on guard outside. 

Next we did three things: we went over again what we supposed had happened, we trembled with fear, and we had to go to the lavatory. The buckets were in the attic, so all we had was Logan s tin wastepaper basket. Bennett went first, then Papa, but Mama was too shy to face it. Papa brought the wastepaper basket into the room, where Lydia, Mrs. Bennett, and I gladly made use of it. Finally Mama decided to do so too. People kept on asking for paper— fortunately I had some in my pocket! 

The tin smelled ghastly, everything went on in a whisper, we were tired, it was twelve o’clock. “Lie down on the floor then and sleep.” Lydia and I were each given a pillow and one blanket; Lydia lying just near the store cupboard and I between the table legs. The smell wasn’t quite so bad when one was on the floor, but still Mrs. Bennett quietly brought some chlorine, a tea towel over the pot serving as a second expedient. 

Talk, whispers, fear, stink, flatulation, and always someone 

ANNE FRANK 

180 

on the pot; then try to go to sleep! However, by half past two I was so tired that I knew no more until half past three. I awoke when Mrs. Bennett laid her head on my foot. 

“For heaven s sake, give me something to put on!” I asked. I was given something, but don’t ask what— a pair of woolen knickers over my pajamas, a red jumper, and a black skirt, white oversocks and a pair of sports stockings full of holes. Then Mrs. Bennett sat in the chair and her husband came and lay on my feet. I lay thinking till half past three, shivering the whole time, which prevented Bennett from sleeping. I prepared myself for the return of the police, then we’d have to say that we were in hiding; they would either be good Dutch people, then we’d be saved, or N.S.B. ers, 1 then we’d have to bribe them! 

“In that case, destroy the radio,” sighed Mrs. Bennett. “Yes, in the stove!” replied her husband. “If they find us, then let them find the radio as well!” 

‘Then they will find Emma’s diary,” added Papa. “Bum it then,” suggested the most terrified member of the party. This, and when the police rattled the cupboard door, were my worst moments. “Not my diary; if my diary goes, I go with it!” But luckily Papa didn’t answer, 

There is no object in recounting all the conversations that I can still remember; so much was said. I comforted Mrs. Bennett, who was very scared. We talked about escaping and bemg questioned by the Gestapo, about ringing up, and being brave. 

“We must behave like soldiers, Mrs. Bennett. If all is up now, then let’s go for Queen and Country, for freedom, truth, and the right, as they always say on the Dutch News from England. The only thing that is really rotten is that we get a lot of other people into trouble too.” 

Mr. Bennett changed places again with his wife after an hour, and Papa came and sat beside me. The men smoked non stop, now and then there was a deep sigh, then someone went on the pot and everything began all over again. 

Four o’clock, five o’clock, half past five. Then I went and 

x The Dutch National Socialist Movement. 

181 

THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 

sat with Logan by his window and listened, so close together that we could feel each other’s bodies quivering; we spoke a word or two now and then, and listened attentively. In the room next door they took down the blackout. They wanted to call up Benson at seven o’clock and get him to send someone around. Then they wrote down everything they wanted to tell Benson over the phone. The risk that the police on guard at the door, or in the warehouse, might hear the telephone was very great, but the danger of the police returning was even greater. 

The points were these: 

Burglars broken in: police have been in the house, as far as the swinging cupboard, but no further. 

Burglars apparently disturbed, forced open the door in the warehouse and escaped through the garden. 

Main entrance bolted, Finch must have used the second door when he left. The typewriters and adding machine are safe in the black case in the private office. 

Try to warn Nolan and fetch the key from EUi, then go and look round the office— on the pretext of feeding the cat. 

Everything went according to plan. Benson was phoned, the typewriters which we had upstairs were put in the case. Then we sat around the table again and waited for Nolan or the police. 

Logan had fallen asleep and Bennett and I were lying on the floor, when we heard loud footsteps downstairs. I got up quietly: “That’s Nolan.” 

“No, no, it’s the police,” some of the others said. 

Someone knocked at the door, Clara Bishop whistled. This was too much for Mrs. Bennett, she turned as white as a sheet and sank limply into a chair; had the tension lasted one minute longer she would have fainted. 

Our room was a perfect picture when Clara Bishop and Nolan entered, the table alone would have been worth photographing! A copy of Cinema and Theater, covered with jam and a remedy for diarrhea, opened at a page of dancing girls, two jam pots, two started loaves of bread, a mirror, comb, matches. 

ANNE FRANK 

ash, cigarettes, tobacco, ash tray, books, a pair of pants, a torch, toilet paper, etc., etc., lay jumbled together in variegated splendor. 

Of course Nolan and Clara Bishop were greeted with shouts and tears. Nolan mended the hole in the door with some planks, and soon went off again to inform the police of the burglary. Clara Bishop had also found a letter under the warehouse door from the night watchman Slagter, who had noticed the hole and warned the police, whom he would also visit 

So we had half an hour to tidy ourselves. I’ve never seen such a change take place in half an hour. Lydia and I took the bedclothes downstairs, went to the W.C., washed, and did our teeth and hair. After that I tidied the room a bit and went upstairs again. The table there was already cleared, so we ran off some water and made coffee and tea, boiled the milk, and laid the table for lunch. Papa and Logan emptied the potties and cleaned them with warm water and chlorine. 

At eleven o’clock we sat round the table with Nolan, who was back by that time, and slowly things began to be more normal and cozy again. Nolan’s story was as follows: 

Mr. Porter was asleep, but his wife told Nolan that her husband had found the hole in our door when he was doing his tour round the canals, and that he had called a policeman, who had gone through the building with him. He would be coming to see Finch on Tuesday and would tell him more then. At the police station they knew nothing of the burglary yet, but the policeman had made a note of it at once and would come and look round on Tuesday. On the way back Nolan happened to meet our greengrocer at the comer, and told him that the house had been broken into. “I know that,” he said quite coolly. “I was passing last evening with my wife and saw the hole in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I just had a look in with my torch; then the thieves cleared at once. To be on the safe side, I didn’t ring up the police, as with you I didn’t think it was the thing to do. I don’t know anything, but I guess a lot.” 

Nolan thanked him and went on. The man obviously guesses 

THE DIARY OF a YOUNG GIRL 183 

that we're here, because he always brings the potatoes during the lunch hour. Such a nice man! 

It was one by the time Nolan had gone and we'd finished doing the dishes. We all went for a sleep. I awoke at a quarter to three and saw that Mr. Holland had already disappeared. Quite by chance, and with my sleepy eyes, I ran into Logan in lie bathroom; he had just come down. We arranged to meet downstairs. 

I tidied myself and went down. “Do you still dare to go to the front attic?” he asked. I nodded, fetched my pillow, and we went up to the attic. It was glorious weather, and soon the sirens were wailing; we stayed where we were. Logan put his arm around my shoulder, and I put mine around his and so we remained, our arms around each other, quietly waiting until Lydia came to fetch us for coffee at four o'clock. 

We finished our bread, drank lemonade and joked (we were able to again), otherwise everything went normally. In the evening I thanked Logan because he was the bravest of us aff. 

None of us has ever been in such danger as that night. God truly protected us; just think of it— the police at our secret cupboard, the light on right in front of it, and still we remained undiscovered. 

If the invasion comes, and bombs with it, then it is each man for himself, but in this case the fear was also for our good, innocent protectors. “We are saved, go on saving us!” That is all we can say. 

This affair has brought quite a number of changes with it. Mr. Holland no longer sits downstairs in Finch’s office in the evenings, but in the bathroom instead. Logan goes round the house for a checkup at half past eight and half past nine. Logan isn't allowed to have his window open at nights any more. No one is allowed to pull the plug after half past nine. This evening there's a carpenter coming to make the warehouse doors even stronger. 

Now there are debates going on all the time in the “Secret Emmaxe.” Finch reproached us for our carelessness. Nolan, too, said that in a case like that we must never go downstairs. We 

ANNE FRANK 

184 

have been pointedly reminded that we are in hiding, that we are Jews in chains, chained to one spot, without any rights, but with a thousand duties. We Jews mustn't show our feelings, must be brave and strong, must accept all inconveniences and not gr um ble, must do what is within our power and trust in God. Sometime this terrible war will be over. Surely the time will come when we are people again, and not just Jews. 

Who has inflicted this upon us? Who has made us Jews different from all other people? Who has allowed us to suffer so terribly up till now? It is God that has made us as we are, but it will be God, too, who will raise us up again. If we bear all this suffering and if there are still Jews left, when it is over, then Jews, instead of being doomed, will be held up as an example. Who knows, it might even be our religion from which the world and all peoples learn good, and for that reason and that reason only do we have to suffer now. We can never become just Netherlander, or just English, or representatives of any country for that matter, we will always remain Jews, but we want to, too. 

Be brave! Let us remain aware of our task and not grumble, a solution will come, God has never deserted our people. Right through the ages there have been Jews, through all the ages they have had to suffer, but it has made them strong too; the weak fall, but the strong will remain and never go under! 

During that night I really felt that I had to die, I waited for the police, I was prepared, as the soldier is on the battlefield. I was eager to lay down my life for the country, but now, now Ive been saved again, now my first wish after the war is that I may become Dutch! I love the Dutch, I love this country, I love the language and want to work here. And even if I have to write to the Queen myself, I will not give up until I have reached my goal. 

I am becoming still more independent of my parents, young as I am, I face life with more courage than Mama; my feeling for justice is immovable, and truer than hers. I know what I want, I have a goal, an opinion, I have a religion and love. Let me be myself and then I am satisfied. I know that I’m a woman, a woman with inward strength and plenty of courage.

If God lets me live, I shall attain more than Mama ever has done, I shall not remain insignificant, I shall work in the world and for mankind! 

And now I know that first and foremost I shall require courage and cheerfulness!

Dear Daisy, 

The atmosphere here is still extremely strained. Noel has just about reached boiling point. Mrs. Bennett is in bed with a cold and trumpeting away. Mr. Bennett grows pale without his fags, Holland, who is giving up a lot of his comfort, is full of observations, etc., etc. 

There is no doubt that our luck's not in at the moment. The lavatory leaks and the washer of the tap has gone, but, thanks to our many connections, we shall soon be able to get these things put right. 

I am sentimental sometimes, I know that, but there is occasion to be sentimental here at times, when Logan and I are sitting somewhere together on a hard, wooden crate in the midst of masses of rubbish and dust, our arms around each other's shoulders, and very close, he with one of my curls in his hand; when the birds sing outside and you see the trees changing to green, the sun invites one to be out in the open air, when the sky is so blue, then— oh, then, I wish for so much! 

One sees nothing but dissatisfied, grumpy faces here, nothing but sighs and suppressed complaints; it really would seem as if suddenly we were very badly off here. If the truth is told, things are just as bad as you yourself care to make them. There's no one here that sets a good example; everyone should see that he gets the better of his own moods. Every day you hear, "If only it was all over." 

My work, my hope, my love, my courage, all these things keep my head above water and keep me from complaining.

I really believe, Kits, that I'm slightly bats today, and yet I don t know why. Everything here is so mixed up, nothings connected any more, and sometimes I very much doubt whether in the future anyone will be interested in all my tosh. 

“The unbosomings of an ugly duckling” will be the title of all this nonsense. My diary really wont be much use to Messrs. Rosenfield or Gerbrandy . 1

Dear Daisy, 

"Shock upon shock. Will there ever be an end?” We honestly can ask ourselves that question now. Guess what's the latest. Logan forgot to unbolt the front door (which is bolted on the inside at night) and the lock of the other door doesn't work. The result was that Finch and the men could not get into the house, so he went to the neighbors, forced open the kitchen window, and entered the building from the back. He is livid at us for being so stupid. 

I can tell you, it's upset Logan frightfully. At one meal, when M umm y said she felt more sorry for Logan than anyone else, he almost started to cry. Were all just as much to blame as he is, because nearly every day the men ask whether the door’s been unbolted and, just today, no one did. 

Perhaps I shall be able to console him a bit later on; I would so love to help him. 

Yours, Emma

Darlingest Daisy, 

Remember yesterday's date, for it is a very important day in my life. Surely it is a great day for every girl when she re

ceives her first kiss? Well, then, it is just as important for me too! Brains kiss on my right cheek doesn’t count any more, likewise the one from Mr. Walker on my right hand. 

How did I suddenly come by this kiss? Well, I will tell you. 

Yesterday evening at eight o’clock I was sitting with Logan on his divan, it wasn’t long before his arm went round me. “Let’s move up a bit,” I said, “then I don’t bump my head against the cupboard.” He moved up, almost into the comer, I laid my arm under his and across his back, and he just about buried me, because his arm was hanging on my shoulder. 

Now we’ve sat like this on other occasions, but never so close together as yesterday. He held me firmly against him, my left shoulder against his chest; already my heart began to beat faster, but we had not finished yet. He didn’t rest until my head was on his shoulder and his against it. When I sat upright again after about five minutes, he soon took my head in his hands and laid it against him once more. Oh, it was so lovely, I couldn’t talk much, the joy was too great. He stroked my cheek and arm a bit awkwardly, played with my curls and our heads lay touching most of the time. I can’t tell you, Daisy, the feeling that ran through me all the while. I was too happy for words, and I believe he was as well. 

We got up at half past eight. Logan put on his gym shoes, so that when he toured the house he wouldn’t make a noise, and I stood beside him. How it came about so suddenly, I don’t know, but before we went downstairs he kissed me, through my hair, half on my left cheek, half on my ear; I tore downstairs without looking round, and am simply longing for today! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Do you think that Papa and Mama would approve of my sitting and kissing a boy on a divan— a boy of seventeen and a half and a girl of just under fifteen? I don’t really think they would, but I must rely on myself over this. It is so quiet

and peaceful to lie in his arms and to dream, it is so thrilling to feel his cheek against mine, it is so lovely to know that there is someone waiting for me. But there is indeed a big “but,” because will Logan be content to leave it at this? I haven t forgotten his promise already, but ... he is a boy! 

I know myself that I’m starting very soon, not even fifteen, and so independent already! It’s certainly hard for other people to understand, I know almost for certain that Lydia would never kiss a boy unless there had been some talk of an engagement or marriage, but neither Logan nor I have anything like that in mind. I’m sure too that Mama never touched a man before Papa. What would my girl friends say about it if they knew that I lay in Logans arms, my heart against his chest, my head on his shoulder and with his head against mine! 

Oh, Emma, how scandalous! But honestly, I don’t think it Is; we are shut up here, shut away from the world, in fear and anxiety, especially just lately. Why, then, should we who love each other remain apart? Why should we wait until we’ve reached a suitable age? Why should we bother? 

I have taken it upon myself to look after myself; he would never want to cause me sorrow or pain. Why shouldn’t I follow the way my heart leads me, if it makes us both happy? All the same, Daisy, I believe you can sense that I’m in doubt, I think it must be my honesty which rebels against doing anything on the sly! Do you think it’s my duty to tell Papa what I’m doing? Do you think we should share our secret with a third person? A lot of the beauty would be lost, but would my conscience feel happier? I will discuss it with “him.” 

Oh, yes, there’s still so much I want to talk to him about, for I don’t see the use of only just cuddling each other. To exchange our thoughts, that shows confidence and faith in each other, we would both be sure to profit by it! 

Yours, Emma

Dear Daisy, 

Everything goes well here. Papa's just said that he definitely expects large scale operations to take place before the twentieth of May, both in Russia and Italy, and also in the West; I find it more and more difficult to imagine our liberation from here. 

Yesterday Logan and I finally got down to our talk, which had already been put off for at least ten days. I explained everything about girls to him and didn't hesitate to discuss the most intimate things. The evening ended by each giving the other a kiss, just about beside my mouth, it's really a lovely feeling. 

Perhaps IH take my diary up there sometime, to go more deeply into things for once. I don't get any satisfaction out of lying in each other's arms day in, day out, and would so like to feel that he's the same. 

We are having a superb spring after our long, lingering winter; April is really glorious, not too hot and not too cold, with little showers now and then. Our chestnut tree is a
