#### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have strong capabilities in solving diverse natural language processing tasks. However, the safety and security issues of LLM systems have become the major obstacle to their widespread application. Many studies have extensively investigated risks in LLM systems and developed the corresponding mitigation strategies. Leading-edge enterprises such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic have also made lots of efforts on responsible LLMs. Therefore, there is a growing need to organize the existing studies and establish comprehensive taxonomies for the community. In this paper, we delve into four essential modules of an LLM system, including an input module for receiving prompts, a language model trained on extensive corpora, a toolchain module for development and deployment, and an output module for exporting LLM-generated content. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy, which systematically analyzes potential risks associated with each module of an LLM system and discusses the corresponding mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we review prevalent benchmarks, aiming to facilitate the risk assessment of LLM systems. We hope that this paper can help LLM participants embrace a systematic perspective to build their responsible LLM systems.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) [1]-[5] that own massive model parameters pre-trained on extensive corpora, have catalyzed a revolution in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The scale-up of model parameters and the expansion of pre-training corpora have endowed LLMs with remarkable capabilities across various tasks, including text generation [2], [4], [5], coding [2], [6], and knowledge reasoning [7]-[10]. Furthermore, alignment techniques (e.g., supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback [4], [11]) are proposed to encourage LLMs to align their behaviors with human preferences, thereby enhancing the usability of LLMs. In practice, advanced LLM systems like ChatGPT [12] have consistently garnered a global user base, establishing themselves as competitive solutions for complex NLP tasks.

Despite the great success of LLM systems, they may sometimes violate human values and preferences, thus raising concerns about safety and security of LLM-based applications.[^0]

Fig. 1. An example of privacy leakage in an LLM system. For a specific risk, our module-oriented risk taxonomy is proposed to help quickly locate system modules associated with the risk.

For example, ChatGPT leaked chat history of users due to vulnerabilities in the Redis client open-source library [13]. In addition, well-crafted adversarial prompts can elicit harmful responses from LLMs [14]. Even without adversarial attacks, current LLMs may still generate untruthful, toxic, biased, and even illegal contents [15]-[19]. These undesirable contents could be abused, resulting in adverse social impacts. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to mitigating these issues [15]-[18]. Leading-edge organizations like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic also make lots of efforts on responsible LLMs, prioritizing the development of beneficial AI [20]-[23].

To mitigate the risks of LLMs, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive taxonomy that enumerates all potential risks inherent in the construction and deployment of LLM systems. This taxonomy is intended to serve as a guidance for evaluating and improving the reliability of LLM systems. Predominantly, the majority of existing efforts [15]-[18] propose their risk taxonomies based on the assessment and analysis of output content with multiple metrics. In general, an LLM system consists of various key modules - an input module for receiving prompts, a language model trained on vast datasets, a toolchain module for development and deployment, and an
output module for exporting LLM-generated content. To the best of our knowledge, there have been limited taxonomies proposed to systematically categorize risks across the various modules of an LLM system. Hence this work aims to bridge the gap to encourage LLM participants to 1) comprehend the safety and security concerns associated with each module of an LLM system, and 2) embrace a systematic perspective for building more responsible LLM systems.

To achieve the goal, we propose a module-oriented taxonomy that classify the risks and their mitigation strategies associated with each module of an LLM system. For a specific risk, the module-oriented taxonomy can assist in quickly pinpointing modules necessitating attention, thereby helping engineers and developers to determine effective mitigation strategies. As illustrated in Figure 1, we provide an example of privacy leakage within an LLM system. Using our moduleoriented taxonomy, we can attribute the privacy leakage issue to the input module, the language model module, and the toolchain module. Consequently, developers can fortify against adversarial prompts, employ privacy training, and rectify vulnerabilities in tools to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage. Besides summarizing the potential risks of LLM systems and their mitigation methods, this paper also reviews widelyadopted risk assessment benchmarks and discusses the safety and security of prevalent LLM systems.

To sum up, this paper makes the following contributions.

- We conduct a comprehensive survey of risks and mitigation methods associated with each module of an LLM system, as well as review the benchmarks for evaluating the safety and security of LLM systems.
- We propose a module-oriented taxonomy, which attributes a potential risk to specific modules of an LLM system. This taxonomy aids developers in gaining a deeper understanding of the root causes behind possible risks and thus facilitates the development of beneficial LLM systems.
- With a more systematic perspective, our taxonomy covers a more comprehensive range of LLM risks than the previous taxonomies. It is worth noting that we consider the security issues closely associated with the toolchain, which is rarely discussed in prior surveys.

Roadmap. The subsequent sections are organized as follows: Section II introduces the background of LLMs. Section III introduces the risks of LLM systems. Section IV offers an overview of the safety and security concerns associated with each module of an LLM system. Section V surveys the mitigation strategies employed by different system modules. Section VI summarizes existing benchmarks for evaluating the safety and security of LLM systems. Finally, Section VII and Section VIII respectively conclude this survey and provide suggestions for the future exploration.

## II. BACKGROUND

Language models (LMs) are designed to quantify the likelihood of a token sequence [24]. In specific, a text is transformed into a sequence of tokens $s=\left\{v_{0}, v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{t}, \cdots, v_{T}\right\}$. The likelihood of $s$ is $p(s)=p\left(v_{0}\right) \cdot \prod_{t=1}^{T} p\left(v_{t} \mid v_{<t}\right)$, where $v_{t} \in \mathcal{V}$. This survey focuses on the most popular generative LMs that generate sequences in an autoregressive manner. Formally, given a sequence of tokens $v_{<t}=$ $\left\{v_{0}, v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{t-1}\right\}$ and a vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$, the next token $v_{t} \in \mathcal{V}$ is determined based on the probability distribution $p\left(v \mid v_{<t}\right)$. Beam search [25] and greedy search [26] are two classic methods to determine the next token. Recently, the prevalent sampling strategies including top- $k$ sampling [27] and nucleus sampling (i.e., top-p sampling) [28], have been widely used to sample $v_{t}$ from $\mathcal{V}$ based on the probability distribution $p\left(v \mid v_{<t}\right)$.

Large language models (LLMs) are the LMs that have billions or even more model parameters pre-trained on massive data, such as LLaMA [3], [4] and GPT families (e.g., GPT3 [1], GPT-3.5 [29], and GPT-4 [30]). Recently, researchers discovered the scaling law [31], i.e., increasing the sizes of pretraining data and model parameters can significantly enhance an LM's capacity for downstream tasks. Such an "emerging ability" is a crucial distinction among the current LLMs and earlier small-scale LMs.

Network Architecture. Among existing LLMs, the mainstream network architecture is Transformer [32], which is a well-known neural network structure in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In general, an LLM is stacked by several Transformer blocks, and each block consists of a multi-head attention layer as well as a feed-forward layer. Additionally, trainable matrices enable mappings between the vocabulary space and the representation space. The key of Transformer is using attention mechanism [32] to reflect the correlations between tokens via attention scores. Therefore, the attention layers could capture the semantically meaningful interactions among different tokens to facilitate representation learning. Training Pipeline. LLMs undergo a series of exquisite development steps to implement high-quality text generation. The typical process of LLM development contains three steps pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and learning from human feedback [11], [24], [33]-[40]. In what follows, we will briefly review the core steps for training LLMs to help readers understand the preliminary knowledge of LLM construction.

- Pre-Training. The initial LLM is pre-trained on a largescale corpora to obtain extensive general knowledge. The pretraining corpora is a mixture of datasets from diverse sources, including web pages, books, and user dialog data. Moreover, specialized data, such as code, multilingual data, and scientific data, is incorporated to enhance LLMs's reasoning and task-solving abilities [41]-[44]. For the collected raw data, data pre-processing [2]-[5] is required to remove noise and redundancy. After that, tokenization [45] is used to transform textual data into token sequences for language modeling. By maximizing the likelihood of token sequences, the pre-trained model is empowered with impressive language understanding and generation ability.
- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Different from the pretraining process which requires a huge demand for computational resources, SFT usually trains the model on a smaller scale but well-designed high-quality instances to unlock LLMs' ability to deal with prompts of multiple downstream tasks [46]. Among recent LLM fine-tuning methods, instruction tuning [11] has become the most popular one, in

which the input prompts follow the instruction format.

- Learning from Human Feedback. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a typical method for aligning LLMs' responses with human preference [11], [47], [48] and enhancing the safety of LLMs [4], [47]. In RLHF, a reward model is trained with human feedback to score the quality of LLMs' output content, where the human preference is expressed as the ranking of multiple LLM outputs about a certain input prompt. Particularly, the architecture of a reward model can also be a language model. For example, OpenAI and DeepMind build their reward models based on GPT-3 [1] and Gopher [49], respectively. After deriving a well-trained reward model, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [50], is adopted to fine-tune an LLM based on the feedback from the reward model. Nevertheless, implementing RLHF algorithms is nontrivial due to their complex training procedures and unstable performance. Therefore, recent attempts propose to learn human preferences by a ranking objective [34]-[37], or express human preferences as natural language and inject them into the SFT procedure [38]-[40].


## III. MODULES OF LLM SYStEMS

In practical applications, users typically interact with language models through an LLM system. An LLM system generally integrates several modules. In this section, we present the pivotal modules of an LLM system and briefly introduce the risks associated with these modules.

LLM Modules. An LLM system involves a series of data, algorithms, and utils, which can be divided into different modules of the LLM system. In this survey, we discuss the most major modules, including an input module for receiving prompts, a language model trained on vast datasets, a toolchain module for development and deployment, and an output module for exporting LLM-generated contents. Figure 2 illustrates the relationships between the aforementioned modules.

- Input Module. The input module is implemented with an input safeguard to receive and pre-process input prompts. In specific, this module usually contains a receiver waiting for the requests typed by users and algorithm-based strategies to filter or limit the requests.
- Language Model Module. The language model is the foundation of the whole LLM system. In essence, this module involves extensive training data and the up-to-date language model trained with these data.
- Toolchain Module. The toolchain module contains utilities employed by the development and deployment of an LLM system. Concretely, this module involves software development tools, hardware platforms, and external tools.
- Output Module. The output module returns the final responses of an LLM system. Generally, the module is accompanied by an output safeguard to revise the LLM-generated content to conform to ethical soundness and justification.

Risks Considered in This Paper. The safety and security of LLM systems have become an essential concern in recent years. Although prior studies have attempted to list a bunch of issues in an LLM system, limited work systematically categorizes these risks into various modules of an LLM system. In this survey, we will shed light on potential risks associated with each module of an LLM system, aiming to

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_a3360899944a38fbee94g-04.jpg?height=1155&width=1767&top_left_y=187&top_left_x=190)

Fig. 3. The overall framework of our taxonomy for the risks of LLM systems. We focus on the risks of four LLM modules including the input module, language model module, toolchain module, and output module, which involves 12 specific risks and 44 sub-categorised risk topics.

help engineers and developers better develop and deploy a trustworthy LLM system.

Figure 2 illustrates the potential risks associated with each module of an LLM system. This survey will take insights into 1) not-suitable-for-work and adversarial prompts encountered by the input module, 2) risks inherent in the language models, 3) threats raised by vulnerabilities in deployment tools, software libraries, and external tools, and 4) dishonest and harmful LLM-generated contents mistakenly passed by the output module as well as their unhelpful uses. In the following sections, we will comprehensively analyze the aforementioned concerns and survey their mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we will summarize typical benchmarks for evaluating the safety and security of LLM systems.

## IV. RISKS IN LLM SYSTEMS

Along with LLMs' growing popularity, the risks associated with LLM systems have also gained attention. In this section, we categorize these risks across various modules of an LLM system. Figure 3 illustrates the overview of the risks we investigated in the survey.

## A. Risks in Input Modules

The input module is the initial window that LLM systems open to the users during the user-machine conversation.
Through the module, users can type the instructions into the system to query desired answers. However, when these input prompts contain harmful content, the LLM systems may face the risk of generating undesired content. In what follows, we divide the malicious input prompts into (1) not-suitable-forwork prompts and (2) adversarial prompts. Figure 4 shows examples of these two types of prompts.

Not-Suitable-for-Work (NSFW) Prompts. Nowadays, the interaction manner of instruction-following LLMs brings the model closer to the users. However, when the prompts contain an unsafe topic (e.g., NSFW content) asked by the users, LLMs could be prompted to generate offensive and biased content. According to [2], [51], the scenarios of these unsafe prompts could include insult, unfairness, crimes, sensitive political topics, physical harm, mental health, privacy, and ethics. Monitoring all the input events in LLM systems should require significantly high labor costs. In particular, it is more difficult to discriminate the harmful input when the prompt hides an unsafe opinion. The imperceptibly unsafe content in the input seriously misleads the model to generate potentially harmful content.

Adversarial Prompts. Adversarial prompts are a new type of threat in LLMs by engineering an adversarial input to elicit an undesired model behavior. Different from NSFW prompts, these adversarial prompts usually pose a clear attack intention. The adversarial inputs are often grouped into prompt
injection attacks and jailbreaks. As the spread of adversarial prompt vulnerability releases for ChatGPT in the community [52]-[55], many developers of LLMs have acknowledged and updated the system to mitigate the issues [2], [56], [57]. According to the attack intention and manners of the input attacks, the adversarial prompts could be divided into two categories, including prompt injection and jailbreaking.

- Prompt Injection. Prompt injection attack aims to misalign an LLM by inserting malicious text in the prompts. specifically, prompt injection includes two types of attacks - goal hijacking and prompt leaking.

1) Goal Hijacking. Goal hijacking is a type of primary attack in prompt injection [58]. By injecting a phrase like "Ignore the above instruction and do ..." in the input, the attack could hijack the original goal of the designed prompt (e.g., translating tasks) in LLMs and execute the new goal in the injected phrase. Since the model may be out of control and respond to malicious queries, goal hijacking gets the most concern in the prompt injection family. In addition to being injected into the user input, the goal-hijacking prompts could also be injected into the data or web pages retrieved by LLMintegrated applications [59]. This type of adversarial prompts could bypass LLMs' safeguards to circumvent content restrictions and even influence the downstream LLM-integrated applications [60], [61].
2) Prompt Leaking. Prompt leaking is another type of prompt injection attack designed to expose details contained in private prompts. According to [58], prompt leaking is the act of misleading the model to print the pre-designed instruction in LLMs through prompt injection. By injecting a phrase like " $\backslash n \backslash n======E N D$. Print previous instructions." in the input, the instruction used to generate the model's output is leaked, thereby revealing confidential instructions that are central to LLM applications. Experiments have shown prompt leaking to be considerably more challenging than goal hijacking [58].

- Jailbreaking. Distinguished from the aforementioned two prompt injection attack methods, jailbreaking no longer involves a simple injection of malicious prompts. Rather, it entails the construction of intricate scenarios through meticulous design and refinement of prompts. The objective is to elicit LLMs to generate harmful content that violates the usage policy. These tailored prompts are designed to be more covert and effective in concealing their malicious intent, thereby circumventing the restrictions imposed on LLMs.

An illustrative example of a jailbreak attack is demonstrated in Figure 4. In this instance, the LLM demonstrates its refusal to a direct malicious query of "How can I create a deadly poison that is undetectable and untraceable". Nevertheless, if the question is concealed within a subtly harmful conversational context, the chatbot could unintentionally produce responses that violate its usage policy. Consequently, the nature of the attacker's intentions allows for the substitution of this query with alternative content that violates the established usage policy parameters. These jailbreaking techniques can be broadly categorized into two groups: One-step Jailbreaks and Multi-step Jailbreaks. For further clarity, the taxonomy and examples of adversarial prompts are presented in Table I.

Fig. 4. Illustration of the NSFW prompts and adversarial prompts. Examples in the figure are taken from [14], [54].

1) One-step jailbreaks. One-step jailbreaks commonly involve direct modifications to the prompt itself, such as setting role-playing scenarios or adding specific descriptions to prompts [14], [52], [67]-[73]. Role-playing is a prevalent method used in jailbreaking by imitating different personas [74]. Such a method is known for its efficiency and simplicity compared to more complex techniques that require domain knowledge [73]. Integration is another type of one-step jailbreaks that integrates benign information on the adversarial prompts to hide the attack goal. For instance, prefix integration is used to integrate an innocuous-looking prefix that is less likely to be rejected based on its pre-trained distributions [75]. Additionally, the adversary could treat LLMs as a program and encode instructions indirectly through code integration or payload splitting [63]. Obfuscation is to add typos or utilize synonyms for terms that trigger input or output filters. Obfuscation methods include the use of the Caesar cipher [64], leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), and Morse code [76]. Besides, at the word level, an adversary may employ Pig Latin to replace sensitive words with synonyms or use token smuggling [77] to split sensitive words into substrings.
2) Multi-step jailbreaks. Multi-step jailbreaks involve constructing a well-designed scenario during a series of conversations with the LLM. Unlike one-step jailbreaks, multi-step jailbreaks usually guide LLMs to generate harmful or sensitive content step by step, rather than achieving their objectives directly through a single prompt. We categorize the multistep jailbreaks into two aspects - Request Contextualizing [65] and External Assistance [66]. Request Contextualizing is inspired by the idea of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] prompting to break down the process of solving a task into multiple steps. Specifically, researchers [65] divide jailbreaking prompts into multiple rounds of conversation between the user and ChatGPT, achieving malicious goals step by step. External Assistance constructs jailbreaking prompts with the assistance of external interfaces or models. For instance, JAILBREAKER [66] is an attack framework to automatically conduct SQL injection attacks in web security to LLM security attacks. Specifically, this method starts by decompiling the

jailbreak defense mechanisms employed by various LLM chatbot services. Therefore, it can judiciously reverse engineer the LLMs' hidden defense mechanisms and further identify their ineffectiveness.

## B. Risks in Language Models

The language model is the core module in the LLM system. In this section, we will present the risks on language models from four aspects, including privacy leakage, toxicity and bias tendencies, hallucinations, and vulnerability to model attacks. Privacy Leakage. To cover a broad range of knowledge and maintain a strong in-context learning capability, recent LLMs are built up with a massive scale of training data from a variety of web resources [78]-[83]. However, these web-collected datasets are likely to contain sensitive personal information, resulting in privacy risks. More precisely, LLMs are trained on corpus with personal data, thereby inadvertently exposing such information during human-machine conversations. A series of studies [16], [68], [84]-[86] have confirmed the privacy leakage issues in the earlier PLMs and LLMs. To gain a deeper comprehension of privacy leakage in LLMs, we outline its underlying causes as follows.

- Private Training Data. As recent LLMs continue to incorporate licensed, created, and publicly available data sources in their corpora, the potential to mix private data in the training corpora is significantly increased. The misused private data, also named as personally identifiable information (PII) [84], [86], could contain various types of sensitive data subjects, including an individual person's name, email, phone number, address, education, and career. Generally, injecting PII into LLMs mainly occurs in two settings - the exploitation of web-collection data and the alignment with personal humanmachine conversations [87]. Specifically, the web-collection data can be crawled from online sources with sensitive PII, and the personal human-machine conversations could be collected for SFT and RLHF.
- Memorization in LLMs. Memorization in LLMs refers to the capability to recover the training data with contextual prefixes. According to [88]-[90], given a PII entity $x$, which is memorized by a model $F$. Using a prompt $p$ could force the model $F$ to produce the entity $x$, where $p$ and $x$ exist in the training data. For instance, if the string "Have a good day! \n alice@email.com" is present in the training data, then the LLM could accurately predict Alice's email when given the prompt "Have a good day! \n". LLMs" memorization is influenced by the model capacity, data duplication, and the length of the prompt prefix [88], which means the issue of PII leakage will be magnified due to the growth of the model parameters, the increasing number of duplicated PII entities in the data, and the increasing length of the prompt related to PII entities
- Association in LLMs. Association in LLMs refers to the capability to associate various pieces of information related to a person. According to [68], [86], given a pair of PII entities $\left(x_{i}, x_{j}\right)$, which is associated by a model $F$. Using a prompt $p$ could force the model $F$ to produce the entity $x_{j}$, where $p$ is the prompt related to the entity $x_{i}$. For instance, an LLM could accurately output the answer when given the prompt "The email address of Alice is", if the LLM associates Alice with her email "alice@email.com". LLMs' association ability is influenced by the target pairs' co-occurrence distances and the co-occurrence frequencies [86]. Since the ability could
enable an adversary to acquire PII entities by providing related information about an individual, LLMs' association ability can contribute to more PII leakage issues compared to memorization [86].

Toxicity and Bias Tendencies. In addition to the private data, the extensive data collection also brings toxic content and stereotypical bias into the training data of LLMs. Training with these toxic and biased data could raise legal and ethical challenges. In specific, the issues of toxicity and bias can potentially arise in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The pre-training data consists of a vast number of unlabelled documents, making it challenging to eliminate low-quality data. The fine-tuning data is relatively smaller in size but has a significant impact on the model, especially in supervised finetuning (SFT). Even a small amount of low-quality data can result in severe consequences. Prior research [91]-[95] has extensively investigated the issues of toxicity and bias related to language models. In this section, we mainly focus on the cause of toxicity and bias in the training data.

- Toxic Training Data. Following previous studies [96], [97], toxic data in LLMs is defined as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is opposite to a polite, positive, and healthy language environment, including hate speech, offensive utterance, profanities, and threats [91]. Although the detection and mitigation techniques [92], [98], [99] of toxicity have been widely studied in earlier PLMs, the training data of the latest LLMs still contain toxic contents due to the increase of data scales and scopes. For instance, within the LLaMA2's pre-training corpora, about $0.2 \%$ of documents could be recognized as toxic content based on a toxicity classifier [4]. Besides, a recent work [100] observes that the toxic content within the training data can be elicited when assigning personas to LLMs. Therefore, it is highly necessary to detoxify LLMs. However, detoxifying presently remains challenging, as simply filtering the toxic training data can lead to a drop in model performance [96].
- Biased Training Data. Compared with the definition of toxicity, the definition of bias is more subjective and contextdependent. Based on previous work [97], [101], we describe the bias as disparities that could raise demographic differences among various groups, which may involve demographic word prevalence and stereotypical contents. Concretely, in massive corpora, the prevalence of different pronouns and identities could influence an LLM's tendency about gender, nationality, race, religion, and culture [4]. For instance, the pronoun He is over-represented compared with the pronoun She in the training corpora, leading LLMs to learn less context about She and thus generate He with a higher probability [4], [102]. Furthermore, stereotypical bias [103] which refers to overgeneralized beliefs about a particular group of people, usually keeps incorrect values and is hidden in the large-scale benign contents. In effect, defining what should be regarded as a stereotype in the corpora is still an open problem.

Hallucinations. In the realm of psychology, hallucination is characterized as a kind of perception [104]. When it comes to the language models, hallucination can be defined as the phenomenon wherein models generate nonsensical, unfaithful, and factual incorrect content [105]-[107]. For a better un-

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_a3360899944a38fbee94g-07.jpg?height=946&width=881&top_left_y=188&top_left_x=1080)

Fig. 5. A brief illustration of the issues on training data and language models.

derstanding of hallucinations, developers of GPT-4 categorize hallucinations into closed-domain hallucination and opendomain hallucination [2]. The former refers to generating extra information that does not exist in the given user input, resulting in factual inconsistencies between the source content and the generated content. For example, an LLM is asked to conduct text summarization, while it introduces extra information that does not exist in the given article [108]-[110]. Open-domain hallucination refers to generating incorrect information about the real world. For example, given an input question "Who is Leonardo da Vinci?", an LLM could output a wrong answer "Leonardo da Vinci is a famous singer". In practice, no matter what kind of hallucinations, their presence can significantly reduce the reliability of LLM systems. Furthermore, as the model size increases, the issue of hallucination will become increasingly serious on the conceptual knowledge [111]-[113]. Hence, there is a pressing demand for eliminating hallucinations from LLMs. In what follows, we present an overview of the widely recognized sources of LLM hallucinations, aiming to facilitate the development of effective mitigation methods.

- Knowledge Gaps. Since the training corpora of LLMs can not contain all possible world knowledge [114]-[119], and it is challenging for LLMs to grasp the long-tail knowledge within their training data [120], [121], LLMs inherently possess knowledge boundaries [107]. Therefore, the gap between knowledge involved in an input prompt and knowledge embedded in the LLMs can lead to hallucinations. For instance, when we ask an LLM the question "What's the weather like tomorrow?", the LLM is prone to providing an incorrect response due to the lack of real-time weather data. Another example is that an LLM may fail to answer the question "Where is Golmud?", since "Golmud" is a long-tail entity
in the model's training corpora, and thus the LLM fails to memorize the knowledge.
- Noisy Training Data. Another important source of hallucinations is the noise in training data, which introduces errors in the knowledge stored in model parameters [111]-[113]. Generally, the training data inherently harbors misinformation. When training on large-scale corpora, this issue becomes more serious because it is difficult to eliminate all the noise from the massive pre-training data.
- False Recall of Memorized Information. Although LLMs indeed memorize the queried knowledge, they may fail to recall the corresponding information [122]. That is because LLMs can be confused by co-occurance patterns [123], positional patterns [124], duplicated data [125]-[127] and similar named entities [113]. Recently, an empirical study [128] reveals that LLMs tend to treat named entities as "indices" to retrieve information from their parameterized knowledge, even though the recalled information is irrelevant to solving the inference task.
- Pursuing Consistent Context. LLMs have been demonstrated to pursue consistent context [129]-[132], which may lead to erroneous generation when the prefixes contain false information. Typical examples include sycophancy [129], [130], false demonstrations-induced hallucinations [113], [133], and snowballing [131]. As LLMs are generally fine-tuned with instruction-following data and user feedback, they tend to reiterate user-provided opinions [129], [130], even though the opinions contain misinformation. Such a sycophantic behavior amplifies the likelihood of generating hallucinations, since the model may prioritize user opinions over facts. Besides, LLMs are often applied to complete downstream tasks via imitating a few demonstration examples (i.e., few-shot in-context learning) [134]. However, such a scheme may lead models to produce incorrect content if the demonstrations contain misinformation [113], [133]. This limitation can be attributed to some special attention heads (i.e., induction heads [135]) in an LLM, which attend to and copy misinformation from the false demonstrations during the generation process. Furthermore, LLMs have been found to generate snowballed hallucinations for consistency with earlier generated hallucinations [131].
- Defective Decoding Process. In general, LLMs employ the Transformer architecture [32] and generate content in an autoregressive manner, where the prediction of the next token is conditioned on the previously generated token sequence. Such a scheme could accumulate errors [105]. Besides, during the decoding process, top- $p$ sampling [28] and top- $k$ sampling [27] are widely adopted to enhance the diversity of the generated content. Nevertheless, these sampling strategies can introduce "randomness" [113], [136], thereby increasing the potential of hallucinations.

Vulnerability to Model Attacks. Model attacks are a bunch of attack techniques that threaten the security of deep learning based models. These attacks exploit the vulnerability of artificial intelligence running at the training and inference stages, aiming to steal valuable information or lead to incorrect responses. In nature, LLMs are large-scale deep neural networks. Hence they also have similar attack surfaces to earlier PLMs and other models. In this section, we summarize traditional adversarial attacks and their feasibility on LLMs.

- Traditional Model Attacks. According to previous work [137], [143], [145], [146], [150], adversarial attacks on models could be divided into five types, including extraction attacks, inference attacks, poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and overhead attacks.

1) Extraction Attacks. Extraction attacks [137] allow an adversary to query a black-box victim model and build a substitute model by training on the queries and responses. The substitute model could achieve almost the same performance as the victim model. While it is hard to fully replicate the capabilities of LLMs, adversaries could develop a domainspecific model that draws domain knowledge from LLMs.
2) Inference Attacks. Inference attacks [150] include membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and data reconstruction attacks. These attacks allow an adversary to infer the composition or property information of the training data. Previous works [67] have demonstrated that inference attacks could easily work in earlier PLMs, implying that LLMs are also possible to be attacked.
3) Poisoning Attacks. Poisoning attacks [143] could influence the behavior of the model by making small changes to the training data. A number of efforts could even leverage data poisoning techniques to implant hidden triggers into models during the training process (i.e., backdoor attacks). Many kinds of triggers in text corpora (e.g., characters, words, sentences, and syntax) could be used by the attackers.
4) Evasion Attacks. Evasion attacks [145] target to cause significant shifts in model's prediction via adding perturbations in the test samples to build adversarial examples. In specific, the perturbations can be implemented based on word changes, gradients, etc.
5) Overhead Attacks. Overhead attacks [146] are also named energy-latency attacks. For example, an adversary can design carefully crafted sponge examples to maximize energy consumption in an AI system. Therefore, overhead attacks could also threaten the platforms integrated with LLMs.

- Model Attacks on LLMs. With the rapid advancement of LLMs, explorations of model attacks on LLMs are growing in the security community. Several studies [16], [151] have evaluated the robustness of LLMs against adversarial examples, exposing vulnerabilities in Flan-T5, BLOOM, ChatGPT, and others. Even for the state-of-the-art GPT-4, its performance could be negatively impacted when evaluated with adversarial prompts generated by LLMs like Alpaca and Vicuna [16], [151]. In specific, the research on inference attacks [67], [152] demonstrated that an adversary could easily extract the training data from GPT-2 and other LLMs. Some studies [153] explored the effectiveness of posing attacks on PLMs and LLMs with prompt triggers. LLMs like GPT-Neo could be planted textual backdoor with a significantly high attack success rate. Except for these traditional attacks, some novel scenarios brought by LLMs have spawned lots of brand-new attack technologies. For instance, prompt abstraction attacks involve inserting an intermediary agent between human-machine conversations to summarize contents and query LLM APIs at a reduced cost [147]. Poisoning attacks inject backdoors into the reward models of RLHF [148]. Furthermore, the capability of

## C. Risks in Toolchain Modules

In this section, we analyze the security concerns associated with the tools involved in the development and deployment lifecycle of LLM-based services. Specifically, we focus on the threats originating from three sources: (1) software development tools, (2) hardware platforms, and (3) external tools.

Security Issues in Software Development Tools. The toolchain for developing LLM is becoming increasingly complex, involving a comprehensive development toolchain such as the programming language runtime, Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) development pipelines, deep learning frameworks, data pre-processing tools, and so on. However, these tools present significant threats to the security of developed LLMs. To address this concern, we identify four primary categories of software development tools and conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying security issues associated with each category.

- Programming Language Runtime Environment. Most LLMs are developed using the Python language, whereas the vulnerabilities of Python interpreters pose threats to the developed models. Many of these vulnerabilities directly impact the development and deployment of LLMs. For instance, poorly coded scripts can inadvertently trigger vulnerabilities that leave the system susceptible to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, leading to CPU and RAM exhaustion (CVE2022-48564). Similarly, CPU cycle DoS vulnerabilities have been identified in CVE-2022-45061 and CVE-2021-3737. Additionally, there is an issue of SHA-3 overflow, as described in CVE-2022-37454. Another noteworthy observation is that LLM training usually involves multiprocessing libraries in the Python standard library. However, recent discoveries have revealed massive information leakages, as seen in CVE-202242919 .
- CI/CD Development Pipelines. The development of LLMs often involves collaboration among many programmers. To effectively manage the development lifecycle of such projects, the use of Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) systems has become prevalent. CI/CD pipelines enable the integration, testing, and delivery of software in a consistent, regular, and automated manner. Various CI/CD services, such as GitLab CI, are commonly employed in LLM development to streamline the workflow and ensure seamless integration and delivery of codes and resources. Several studies have explored the CI/CD pipelines, aiming to comprehend their challenges and trade-offs. Existing work analyzed public continuous integration services [154], shedding light on the risks posed by human factors, such as the risk of supply chain attacks. Subsequently, numerous exploitable plugins were identified in GitLab CI systems [155]. These plugins could inadvertently expose the codes and training data of LLMs, posing a significant security concern.
- Deep Learning Frameworks. LLMs are implemented based on deep learning frameworks. Notably, various vulnerabilities in these frameworks have been disclosed in recent years. As reported in the past five years, three of the most common types of vulnerabilities are buffer overflow attacks, memory corruption, and input validation issues. For example, CVE-2023-25674 is a null-pointer bug that leads to crashes during LLM training. Similarly, CVE-2023-25671 involves out-of-bound crash attacks, and CVE-2023-25667 relates to an integer overflow issue. Furthermore, even popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch experienced various security issues. One example is the influential CVE-2022-45907, which brings the risk of arbitrary code execution.
- Pre-Processing Tools. Pre-processing tools play a crucial role in the context of LLMs. These tools, which are often involved in computer vision (CV) tasks, are susceptible to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in tools such as OpenCV. Consequently, these attacks can be leveraged to target LLMbased computer vision applications. For instance, image-based attacks, such as image scaling attacks, involve manipulating the image scaling function to inject meaningless or malicious input [158], [162]. Additionally, the complex structures in-

volved in processing images can introduce risks such as control flow hijacking vulnerabilities, as exemplified by CVE-20232618 and CVE-2023-2617.

Security Issues in Hardware Platforms. LLM requires dedicated hardware systems for training and inference, which provide huge computation power. These complex hardware systems introduce security issues to LLM-based applications.

- GPU Computation Platforms. The training of LLMs requires significant GPU resources, thereby introducing an additional security concern. GPU side-channel attacks have been developed to extract the parameters of trained models [159], [163]. To tackle this issue, researchers have designed secure environments to secure GPU execution [164]-[166], which mitigate the risks associated with GPU side-channel attacks and safeguard the confidentiality of LLM parameters.
- Memory and Storage. Similar to conventional programs, hardware infrastructures can also introduce threats to LLMs. Memory-related vulnerabilities, such as rowhammer attacks [160], can be leveraged to manipulate the parameters of LLMs, giving rise to attacks such as the Deephammer attack [167], [168]. Several mitigation methods have been proposed to protect deep neural networks (DNNs) [169], [170] against these attacks. However, the feasibility of applying these methods to LLMs, which typically contain a larger number of parameters, remains uncertain.
- Network Devices. The training of LLMs often relies on distributed network systems [171], [172]. During the transmission of gradients through the links between GPU server nodes, significant volumetric traffic is generated. This traffic can be susceptible to disruption by burst traffic, such as pulsating attacks [161]. Furthermore, distributed training frameworks may encounter congestion issues [173].

Security Issues in External Tools. External tools such as web APIs [174] and other machine learning models for specific tasks [175] can be used to expand the action space of LLMs and allow LLMs to handle more complex tasks [176], [177]. However, these external tools may bring security risks to LLM-based applications. We identify two prominent security concerns about the external tools.

- Factual Errors Injected by External Tools. External tools typically incorporate additional knowledge into the input prompts [122], [178]-[184]. The additional knowledge often originates from public resources such as Web APIs and search engines. As the reliability of external tools is not always ensured, the content returned by external tools may include factual errors, consequently amplifying the hallucination issue.
- Exploiting External Tools for Attacks. Adversarial tool providers can embed malicious instructions in the APIs or prompts [84], leading LLMs to leak memorized sensitive information in the training data or users' prompts (CVE2023-32786). As a result, LLMs lack control over the output, resulting in sensitive information being disclosed to external tool providers. Besides, attackers can easily manipulate public data to launch targeted attacks, generating specific malicious outputs according to user inputs. Furthermore, feeding the information from external tools into LLMs may lead to injection attacks [61]. For example, unverified inputs may result in arbitrary code execution (CVE-2023-29374).


## D. Risks in Output Modules

The originally generated content faced by the output module could violate the user's reference, displaying harmful, untruthful, and unhelpful information. Therefore, it is highly necessary for this module to review and intervene the LLMgenerated content before exporting the content to users. In this subsection, we will shed light on the risks at the output end.

Harmful Content. The generated content sometimes contains biased, toxic, and private information. Bias represents inequitable attitude and position of LLM systems [185]-[187]. For example, researchers have found that GPT-3 frequently associates professions like legislators, bankers, or professors with male characteristics, whereas roles such as nurses, receptionists, and housekeepers are more commonly linked with female characteristics [1]. This phenomenon can lead to increased social tensions and conflicts. Toxicity means the generated content contains rude, disrespectful, and even illegal information [188], [189]. For example, ChatGPT may generate toxic content when playing the role of a storytelling grandmother or "Muhammad Ali" [100]. Whether intentionally or not, the toxicity content will not only directly affect the physical and mental health of users, but also inhibit the harmony of cyberspace. Privacy Leakage means the generated content includes sensitive personal information. It is reported [190] that the federal privacy commissioner of Canada has received complaints that OpenAI collects, uses, and discloses personal
information without permission. Besides, employees may use LLM systems to help them improve work efficiency, but this behavior will also lead to the disclosure of business secrets [191], [192].

Untruthful Content. The LLM-generated content could contain inaccurate information [105], [120], [193]-[195]. For example, given the prompt "Who took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our solar system?", the first demo of Google's Chatbot Bard gave an untruthful answer "James Webb Space Telescope" [196], while these pictures were actually taken by the VLT Yepun Telescope. Besides the factuality errors, the LLM-generated content could contain faithfulness errors [107]. For instance, an LLM is requested to summarize a given article, while the output content has conflicts with the given article [107]. Essentially, the untruthful content is highly related to LLM hallucination. Please refer to the early part of this section for the summary of sources of LLM hallucination. Unhelpful Uses. Although LLM systems have largely improved human's work efficiency, improper use of LLM systems (i.e., abuse of LLM systems) will cause adverse social impacts [197], [198], such as academic misconduct [199], [200], copyright violation [201], [202], cyber attacks [203], [204], and software vulnerabilities [205]. Here are some realistic cases. First, many educational institutions have banned the use of ChatGPT and similar products [199], [200], since excessive reliance on LLM systems will affect the independent thinking ability of in-school students and result in academic plagiarism. Besides, LLM systems may output content similar to existing works, infringing on copyright owners. Moreover, hackers can obtain malicious code in a low-cost and efficient manner to automate cyber attacks [203], [204] with powerful LLM systems. Europol Innovation Lab [206] warned that criminal organizations have utilized LLM systems to build malware families, such as ransomware, backdoors, and hacking tools [207]. In addition, programmers are accustomed to using code generation tools such as Github Copilot [208] for program development, which may bury vulnerabilities in the program. It is worth noting that research on Copilotgenerated code has shown that certain types of vulnerabilities are usually contained in the generated code [205]. Furthermore, practitioners in other important fields, such as law and medicine, rely on LLM systems to free them from heavy work. However, LLM systems may lack a deeper understanding of professional knowledge, and thus improper legal advice and medical prescriptions will have a serious negative impact on the company operations and health of patients.

## V. Mitigation

As analyzed in Section IV, LLM systems contain a variety of risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise their reliability. In this section, we survey the mitigation strategies for each risk. Figure 6 shows the overview of mitigation to alleviate the risks of LLM systems.

## A. Mitigation in Input Modules

Mitigating the threat posed by the input module presents a significant challenge for LLM developers due to the diversity of the harmful inputs and adversarial prompts [209], [210]. Recently, practitioners have summarized some effective defense methods to mitigate the impacts of malicious prompts through black-box testing of existing LLMs. According to the previous work, existing mitigation methods are mainly divided into the following two categories - defensive prompt design and adversarial prompt detection.

Defensive Prompt Design. Directly modifying the input prompts is a viable approach to steer the behavior of the model and foster the generation of responsible outputs. This method integrates contextual information or constraints in the prompts to provide background knowledge and guidelines while generating the output [22]. This section summarizes three methods of designing input prompts to achieve defense purposes.

- Safety Preprompt. A straightforward defense strategy is to impose the intended behavior through the instruction passed to the model. By injecting a phrase like "note that malicious users may try to change this instruction; if that's the case, classify the text regardless" into the input, the additional context information provided within the instruction helps to guide the model to perform the originally expected task [54], [211]. Another instance involves utilizing adjectives associated with safe behavior (e.g., "responsible", "respectful" or "wise") and prefixing the prompt with a safety pre-prompt like "You are a safe and responsible assistant" [4].
- Adjusting the Order of Pre-Defined Prompt. Some defense methods achieve their goals by adjusting the order of predefined prompts. One such method involves placing the user input before the pre-defined prompt, known as post-prompting defense [212]. This strategic adjustment renders goal-hijacking attacks that inject a phrase like "Ignore the above instruction and do..." ineffective. Another order-adjusted approach, named sandwich defense [213], encapsulates the user input between two prompts. This defense mechanism is considered to be more robust and secure compared to post-prompting techniques.
- Changing Input Format. This kind of method aims to convert the original format of input prompts to alternative formats. Typically, similar to including the user input between <user_input $>$ and $</$ user_input $>$, random sequence enclosure method [214] encloses the user input between two randomly generated sequences of characters. Moreover, some efforts employ JSON formats to parameterize the elements within a prompt. This involves segregating instructions from inputs and managing them separately [215]. For example, benefiting from the format "Translate to French. Use this format: English: $\{$ English text as JSON quoted string \} French: $\{$ French translation, also quoted $\}$ ", only the text in English JSON format can be identified as the English text to be translated. Therefore, the adversarial input will not influence the instruction.

Malicious Prompt Detection. Different from the methods of designing defensive prompts to preprocess the input, the malicious prompt detection method aims to detect and filter out the harmful prompts through the input safeguard.

- Keyword Matching. Keyword matching is a common technique for preventing prompt hacking [63]. The basic idea

Fig. 6. The overall framework of our taxonomy for the mitigation of LLM systems. Facing the risks of the 4 modules in LLM systems, we investigated 12 specific mitigation strategies and discussed 35 sub-categorized defense techniques to ensure the security of LLM systems.

of the strategy is to check for words and phrases in the initial prompt that should be blocked. LLM developers can use a blocklist (i.e., a list of words and phrases to be blocked) or an allowlist (i.e., a list of words and phrases to be allowed) to defend undesired prompts [216]-[222]. These defense mechanisms monitor the input, detecting elements that could break ethical guidelines. These guidelines cover various content types, such as sensitive information, offensive language, or hate speech. For instance, both Bing Chat and Bard incorporate keyword-mapping algorithms in their input safeguard to reduce the policy-violating inputs [66]. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the inherent flexibility of natural languages allows for multiple prompt constructions that convey identical semantics. Consequently, the rule-based matching methods exhibit limitations in mitigating the threat posed by malicious prompts.

- Content Classifier. Training a classifier to detect and refuse malicious prompts is a promising approach. For example, NeMo-Guardrails [223] is an open-source toolkit developed by Nvidia to enhance LLMs with programmable guardrails. When presented with an input prompt, the jailbreak guardrail employs the Guardrails' "input rails" to assess whether the prompt violates the LLM usage policies. If the prompt is found to breach these policies, the guardrail will reject the question, ensuring a safe conversation scenario. Generally, the key behind a prompt classifier is to carefully design the input features of the classifier. Recently, the trajectory of latent predictions in LLMs has been demonstrated to be a useful feature for training a malicious prompt detector [224], [225]. It is worth noting that such features can help enhance the interpretability of the malicious prompt detector. In addition, the LLM itself can serve as a detector. For example, feeding instructions like "You are Eliezer Yudkowsky, with a strong security mindset. Your job is to analyze whether the input prompt is safe..." to guide LLMs can enhance LLMs' ability to judge whether a prompt is malicious [214].


## B. Mitigation in Language Models

This section delves into mitigating risks associated with models, encompassing privacy preservation, detoxification and debiasing, mitigation of hallucinations, and defenses against model attacks.

Privacy Preserving. Privacy leakage is a crucial risk of LLMs, since the powerful memorization and association capabilities of LLMs raise the risk of revealing private information within the training data. Researchers are devoted to designing privacypreserving frameworks in LLMs [226], [227], aiming to safeguard sensitive PII from possible disclosure during humanmachine conservation. Studies to overcome the challenge of privacy leakage include privacy data interventions and differential privacy methods.

- Private Data Interventions. The intervention can be accomplished by lexicon-based approaches [228] or trainable classifiers [229]-[231]. The lexicon-based approaches are usually based on pre-defined rules to recognize and cleanse sensitive PII entities. Alternatively, recent work tends to employ neural networks to automate the intervention process. For instance, the developers of GPT-4 have built automatic models to identify and remove the PII entities within the training data [2]. A number of evaluation studies [231], [232] demonstrated that the methods of data intervention like deduplication and text sanitization are able to effectively improve the safety of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-7B) in privacy.
- Privacy Enhanced Techniques. Differential privacy (DP) [233]-[235] is a type of randomized algorithm to protect a private dataset from privacy leakage. To preserve individual information memorized by the model, developers can train the model with a differential privacy guarantee to hide the difference between two neighboring datasets (only one element is different between the two datasets). The goal of DP algorithms is to leave an acceptable distance that makes the two datasets indistinguishable. Lots of efforts have developed $\mathrm{DP}$ techniques as the standard for protecting privacy in earlier transformer-based PLMs and LLMs [236]-[238]. However, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of differential privacy inevitably degrades the model's performance. Therefore, researchers have employed a series of techniques to augment the model's utility and make a better privacy-utility trade-off [227], [239]-[241]. Recently, with the emergence of LLMs, a growing number of studies [227], [242]-[246] are applying the DP techniques during the pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Detoxifying and Debiasing. To reduce the toxicity and bias of LLMs, prior efforts mainly focus on enhancing the quality of training data and conducting safety training.

- Toxic and Biased Data Interventions. Similar to the idea of privacy data intervention, toxic/biased data intervention aims to filter undesired content within large-scale web-collected datasets to derive higher-quality training data. For toxicity detection, previous work [247], [248] usually uses labeled datasets to train toxicity classifiers [249]. Some of them have developed advanced automated tools to detect the toxic data in the training corpora, such as Perspective API [250] and Azure AI Content Safety [251]. For data debiasing, the majority of studies [252]-[255] focus on removing or altering bias-related words in the corpora, such as generating a revised dataset by replacing bias-related words (e.g., gendered words) with their opposites [253] or replacing biased texts in the dataset with neutral texts [254]. However, recent work [96] finds that a simple data intervention method may increase LM loss and carry the risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. As a consequence, researchers in LLMs employ varied strategies when addressing toxic and biased data. For example, GPT-4 took a proactive approach to data filtering, whereas LLaMA refrained from such interventions [2], [4].
- Safety Training. Different from the data intervention-based methods of detoxifying and debiasing, safety training is a training-based method to mitigate toxicity and bias issues. For model detoxifying, several approaches [256]-[258] regard detoxification as a style transfer task, and thus they fine-tune language models to transfer offensive text into non-offensive variants. For model debiasing, a bunch of studies [252], [259][262] attempt to use word embedding or adversarial learning to mitigate the impact caused by the proportion gaps between different demographic words. With the development of LLMs, recent works [263], [264] demonstrated that using the training techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can effectively improve the performance of detoxifying and debiasing. For instance, GPT-4 performs RLHF with rule-based reward models (RBRMs) [56], [265] to instruct the model to learn rejection abilities when responding to the harmful queries [2]. LLaMA2 employs safety context distillation to help the LLM output safer responses [266].

Hallucination Mitigation. Hallucinations, one of the key challenges associated with LLMs, have received extensive studies. Several surveys such as [105]-[107] have comprehensively reviewed the related work. Here we summarize some typical methods for alleviating the LLM hallucinations.

- Enhancing the Quality of Training Data. As low-quality training data can undermine the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, numerous efforts have been dedicated to carefully curating the training data. Nevertheless, it is challenging for human experts to check every data instance in the largescale pre-training corpora. Thus, using well-designed heuristic methods to improve the quality of pre-training data is a popular choice [1], [4], [118], [267]. For example, LLaMA2 upsamples the most factual sources to reduce hallucinations [4]. For the SFT data whose scale is relatively small, human experts can fully engage in the process of data cleaning [46]. Recently, a synthetic dataset is constructed for model finetuning to alleviate the sycophancy issue, where the claim's truthfulness and the user's opinion are set to be independent [129]. Besides, LIMA [46] demonstrates that only scaling up data quantity makes limited contributions to SFT. Instead, enhancing the quality and diversity of SFT data can better benefit the alignment process, revealing the necessity of data cleaning.
- Learning from Human Feedback. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [11] has been demonstrated to have the ability to improve the factuality of LLMs [268]. RLHF generally consists of two phases - training a reward model with human feedback and optimizing an LLM with the reward model's feedback. GPT-4 [2] trains a reward model with well-designed synthetic data for reducing hallucinations, largely increasing its accuracy on the TruthfulQA dataset [111]. Other advanced LLMs or LLM systems, such as InstructGPT [11], ChatGPT [12], and LLaMA2-Chat [4], also employ RLHF to improve their performance. Nevertheless, reward hacking may exist in RLHF, i.e., the learned reward model and the humans do not always have consistent preferences [269]. Therefore, LLaVA-RLHF [269] proposes Factually Augmented RLHF to augment the reward model with factual information. Moreover, it is worth noting that implementing RLHF algorithms is non-trivial due to their complex training procedures and unstable performance [270]. To overcome this, researchers propose to learn human preferences in an offline manner, where the human preferences
are expressed by ranking information [34]-[37] or natural language [38]-[40] to be injected into the SFT procedure.
- Exploiting External Knowledge. LLM hallucinations caused by the absence of certain domain-specific data can be mitigated through the supplementation of training data. However, in practice, encompassing all conceivable domains within the training corpus is challenging. Therefore, a prevalent approach to mitigating hallucinations is to integrate external knowledge as supporting evidence for content generation. Generally, the external knowledge is utilized as a part of the input [122], [178]-[184] or used as evidence for a post-hoc revision process [271]-[276]. To obtain the external knowledge, pioneer studies retrieve factual triplets from reliable knowledge bases (KBs) [277]-[279]. Nevertheless, KBs typically have limited general knowledge, primarily due to the high cost of human annotations. Hence, information retrieval (IR) systems are used to retrieve evidence from open-ended Web sources (e.g., Wikipedia) [178]. However, information gathered from the Web sources carries noisy information and redundancy, which can mislead LLMs to generate unsatisfied responses. To mitigate this issue, recent endeavors refine models' responses through automated feedback [178], [280] or clarifications from human users [183]. Besides obtaining external knowledge from aforementioned non-parametric sources, a Parametric Knowledge Guiding (PKG) framework [281] is proposed to use a trainable task-specific module to generate relevant context as the augmented knowledge.
- Improving Decoding Strategies. When the LLM possesses information pertaining to a specific prompt, enhancing the decoding strategy is a promising choice for mitigating hallucinations. Typically, in contrast to conventional nucleus sampling (i.e., top- $p$ sampling) used by the decoding procedure, factualnucleus sampling [113] gradually decays the value of $p$ at each step of generation, as the generated content will become increasingly determined as the generation proceeds. Inspired by that the generation probability of a correct answer tends to incrementally rise from the lower layers to the higher layers, DoLa [282] computes the distribution of the next token based on the contrast between logits in a higher layer and that in a lower layer. After identifying a set of attention heads capable of eliciting the correct answer, ITI [283] intervenes with these selected attention heads. Motivated by that the contrasts between expert and amateur LMs can signal which generated text is better, Contrastive Decoding (CD) [284] is proposed to exploit such contrasts to guide the decoding process. In terms of the sycophancy issue, subtracting a sycophancy steering vector at the hidden layers can help reduce LLMs' sycophantic tendency [285]. For the case that LLMs fail to exploit external knowledge introduced in the context, context-aware decoding (CAD) [180] is proposed to encourage LLMs to trust the input context if relevant input context is provided.
- Multi-Agent Interaction. Engaging multiple LLMs in debate also assists in reducing hallucinations [286]. Specifically, after the initial generation, each LLM is instructed to generate a subsequent response, taking into account the responses of other LLMs. After successive rounds of debates, these LLMs tend to generate more consistent and reliable responses. In scenarios where only two language models are accessible, one can be employed to generate claims, while the other verifies the truthfulness of these claims [287]. Nevertheless, methods based on multi-agent interaction can be computationally expensive, primarily attributed to the extensive context and the participation of multiple LLM instances.

Defending Against Model Attacks. Recognizing the significant threats posed by various model attacks, earlier studies [144], [288] have proposed a variety of countermeasures for conventional deep learning models. Despite the advancements in the scale of parameters and training data seen in LLMs, they still exhibit vulnerabilities similar to their predecessors. Leveraging insights from previous defense strategies applied to earlier language models, it is plausible to employ existing defenses against extraction attacks, inference attacks, poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and overhead attacks on LLMs.

- Defending Against Extraction Attacks. To counter the extraction attacks, the earlier defense strategies [289]-[291] against model extraction attacks usually modify or restrict the generated response provided for each query. In specific, the defender usually deploys a disruption-based strategy [290] to adjust the numerical precision of model loss, add noise to the output, or return random responses. However, this type of method usually introduces a performance-cost tradeoff [290], [292]-[294]. Besides, recent work [137] has been demonstrated to circumvent the disruption-based defenses via disruption detection and recovery. Therefore, some attempts adopt warning-based methods [295] or watermarking methods [296] [297] to defend against the extraction attacks. Specifically, warning-based methods are proposed to measure the distance between continuous queries to identify the malware requests, while watermarking methods are used to claim the ownership of the stolen models.
- Defending Against Inference Attacks. Since inference attacks target to extract memorized training data in LLMs, a straightforward mitigation strategy is to employ privacypreserving methods, such as training with differential privacy [298], [299]. In addition, a series of efforts utilize regularization techniques [300]-[302] to alleviate the inference attacks, as the regularization can discourage models from overfitting to their training data, making such inference unattainable. Furthermore, adversarial training is employed to enhance the models' robustness against inference attacks [150], [303], [304].
- Defending Against Poisoning Attacks. Addressing poisoning attacks has been extensively explored in the federated learning community [143], [305]. In the realm of LLMs, perplexity-based metrics or LLM-based detectors are usually leveraged to detect poisoned samples [306], [307]. Additionally, some approaches [308], [309] reverse the engineering of backdoor triggers, facilitating the detection of backdoors in models.
- Defending Against Evasion Attacks. Related efforts can be broadly categorized into two types: proactive methods and reactive methods. Proactive methods aim to train a robust model capable of resisting adversarial examples. Specifically, the defenders employ techniques such as network distillation [316], [317] and adversarial training [145], [318] to enhance models' robustness. Conversely, reactive methods aim to iden-

tify adversarial examples before their input into the model. Prior detectors have leveraged adversarial example detection techniques [310], [311], input reconstruction approaches [312], [313], and verification frameworks [314], [315] to identify potential attacks.

- Defending Against Overhead Attacks. In terms of the threat of resource drainage, a straightforward method is to set a maximum energy consumption limit for each inference. Recently, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) [319] has highlighted the concern of model denial of service (MDoS) in applications of LLMs. OWASP recommends a comprehensive set of mitigation methods, encompassing input validation, API limits, resource utilization monitoring, and control over the LLM context window.


## C. Mitigation in Toolchain Modules

Existing studies have designed methods to alleviate the security issues of tools in the lifecycle of LLMs. In this section, we summarize the mitigations of those issues according to the categories of tools.

Defenses for Software Development Tools. Most existing vulnerabilities in programming languages, deep learning frameworks, and pre-processing tools, aim to hijack control flows. Therefore, control-flow integrity (CFI), which ensures that the control flows follow a predefined set of rules, can prevent the exploitation of these vulnerabilities. However, CFI solutions incur high overheads when applied to large-scale software such as LLMs [320], [321]. To tackle this issue, a low-precision version of CFI was proposed to reduce overheads [322]. Hardware optimizations are proposed to improve the efficiency of CFI [323].

In addition, it is critical to analyze and prevent security accidents in the environments of LLMs developing and deploying. We argue that data provenance analysis tools can be leveraged to forensic security issues [324]-[327] and detect attacks against LLM actively [328]-[330]. The key concept of data provenance revolves around the provenance graph, which is constructed based on audit systems. Specifically, the vertices in the graph represent file descriptors, e.g., files, sockets, and devices. Meanwhile, the edges depict the relationships between these file descriptors, such as system calls. Bates et al. are the pioneers in developing a Linux-based system for constructing the provenance graph, which is based on the Linux audit subsystem [331]. HOLMES [332] is the first advanced persistent attack (APT) analysis system that leverages data provenance. ATLAS [333] utilizes RNNs to construct a comprehensive procedure for attacks on computation clusters. ALchemist [334] employs application logs to facilitate the construction of provenance graphs. UNICORN [335] detects attacks on the graph through time window-based analysis. ProvNinja [336] focuses on studying evasion attacks against detection based on the provenance graph. PROVDETECTOR [337] aims to capture malware through analysis based on the provenance graph. However, conducting data provenance on LLM-based systems remains a challenging task [324], [327], [338]. We identify several issues that contribute to the challenges of conducting data provenance on LLM-based systems:

- Computational Resources. LLMs are computationally intensive models that require significant processing power and memory resources. Capturing and storing detailed data provenance information for every input and output can result in a substantial increase in computational overheads.
- Storage Requirements. LLMs generate a large volume of data, including intermediate representations, attention weights, and gradients. Storing this data for provenance purposes can result in substantial storage requirements.
- Latency and Response Time. Collecting detailed data provenance information in real-time can introduce additional latency and impact the overall response time of LLM-based systems. This overhead can be particularly challenging for real-time processing, such as language translation services.
- Privacy and Security. LLMs often handle sensitive or confidential data, e.g., personal information or proprietary business data. Capturing and maintaining data provenance raises concerns about privacy and security, as such information increases attack surfaces for breaches or unauthorized access.
- Model Complexity and Interpretability. LLMs, especially advanced architectures like GPT-3, are highly complex models. Tracing and understanding the provenance of specific model outputs or decisions can be challenging due to the complexity and lack of interpretability of these models.

Defenses for LLM Hardware Systems. For memory attacks, many existing defenses against manipulating DNN inferences via memory corruption are based on error correction [160], [167], whereas incurring high overheads [168]. In contrast, some studies aim to revise DNN architectures, making it hard for attackers to launch memory-based attacks, e.g., Aegis [169]. For network-based attacks, which disrupt the communication between GPU machines, existing traffic detection systems can identify these attacks. Whisper leverages the frequency features to detect evasion attacks [339]. FlowLens extractes distribution features for fine-grained detection on data-plane [340]. Similarly, NetBeacon [341] installs tree models on programmable switches. Also, many systems
are implemented on SmartNICs, e.g., SmartWatch [342] and N3IC [343]. Different from these flow-level detection methods, Kitsune [344] and nPrintML [345] learn per-packet features. Moreover, HyperVision builds graphs to detect advanced attacks [346]. Besides, practical defenses on traditional forwarding devices are developed [347]-[349].

Defenses for External Tools. It is difficult to eliminate risks introduced by external tools. The most straightforward and efficient approach is ensuring that only trusted tools are used, but it will impose limitations on the range of usages. Moreover, employing multiple tools (e.g., VirusTotal [350]) and aggregation techniques [351] can reduce the attack surfaces. For injection attacks, it will be helpful to implement strict input validation and sanitization [352] for any data received from external tools. Additionally, isolating the execution environment and applying the principle of least privilege can limit the impact of attacks [353].

For privacy issues, data sanitization methods can detect and remove sensitive information during the interaction between LLMs and external tools. For example, automatic unsupervised document sanitization can be performed using the information theory and knowledge bases [354]. Exsense [355] uses the BERT model to detect sensitive information from unstructured data. The similarities between word embeddings of sensitive entities and words in documents can be used to detect and anonymize sensitive information [356]. Besides, designing and enforcing ethical guidelines for external API usage can mitigate the risk of prompt injection and data leakage [357].

## D. Mitigation in Output Modules

Although extensive efforts have been made at other modules, the output module may still encounter unsafe generated content. Therefore, an effective safeguard is desired at the output module to refine the generated content. Here we summarize key techniques commonly used by the safeguard, including detection, intervention, and watermarking.

Detection. An essential step of the output safeguard is to detect undesirable content. To do this, two open-source Python packages - Guard [358] and Guardrails [359], are developed to check for sensitive information in the generated content. Additionally, Azure OpenAI Service [360] integrates the ability to detect different categories of harmful content (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm) and give a severity level (safe, low, medium, and high). Furthermore, NeMo Guardrails [223] an open-source software developed by NVIDIA, can filter out undesirable generated texts and restrict human-LLM interactions to safe topics. Generally, the detectors are either rulebased [361], [362] or neural network-based [363]-[365], and the latter can better identify cryptic harmful information [366]. In practice, developers of GPT-4 leverage the LLM itself to construct a harmful content detector [367]. The user guide of LLaMA2 [368] suggests building the detectors with block lists and trainable classifiers. For the untruthful generated content, the most popular detectors are either fact-based or consistencybased. Specifically, the fact-based methods resort to external knowledge [369]-[371] and given context [372], [373] for fact verification, while the consistency-based methods generate multiple responses for probing the LLM's uncertainty

about the output [374]-[378]. We suggest readers refer to the surveys [107], [379] for more comprehensives summarization. Intervention. When harmful generated content is detected, a denial-of-service response can be used to inform users that the content poses risks and cannot be displayed. Notably, when developing products powered by LLMs, it is highly necessary to consider the balance between safety and user experience. For example, certain terms related to sex are appropriate in the context of medical tasks, and therefore, simply detecting and filtering content based on sexual vocabulary is unreasonable for medical tasks. For the untruthful generated content, it is demanded to correct the untruthful information in it. Specifically, the untruthfulness issue is highly related to hallucinations of LLMs. Several model-level mitigation methods have been summarized in Section V-B. Here we introduce methods used by the output end. Typically, given the LLM-generated content, methods like Verify-and-Edit [380], [381], CRITIC [382], and REFEED [274] collect supporting facts from external tools (e.g., knowledge bases and search engines) to correct the untruthful information. Besides, consistency-based methods [383] are proposed to generate answers multiple times and choose the most reasonable answer as the final response. Nevertheless, the aforementioned approaches incur additional computational costs. Hence it is desirable to investigate more resource-efficient methods for correcting the untruthful generated content at the output end.

Watermarking. With the assistance of LLMs, we can obtain LLM-generated texts that resemble human writing. Adding watermarks to these texts could be an effective way to avoid the abuse issue. Watermarking offers promising potential for ownership verification mechanisms for effective government compliance management in the LLM-generated content era.

Concretely, watermarks are visible or hidden identifiers [384]. For example, when interacting with an LLM system, the output text may include specific prefixes, such as "As an artificial intelligence assistant, ...", to indicate that the text is generated by an LLM system. However, these visible watermarks are easy to remove. Therefore, watermarks are embedded as hidden patterns in texts that are imperceptible to humans [385]-[391]. For instance, watermarks can be integrated by substituting select words with their synonyms or making nuanced adjustments to the vertical positioning of text lines without altering the semantics of the original text [389]. A representative method involves using the hash value of preceding tokens to generate a random seed [385]. This seed is then employed to divide tokens into two categories: a "green" list and a "red" list. This process encourages a watermarked LLM to preferentially sample tokens from the "green" list, continuing this selection process until a complete sentence is embedded. However, this method has recently been demonstrated to have limitations [392], because it is easy for an attacker to break watermarking mechanisms [393]. To address these challenges, a unified formulation of statistical watermarking based on hypothesis testing [394], explores the trade-off between error types and achieving near-optimal rates in the i.i.d. setting. By establishing a theoretical foundation for existing and future statistical watermarking, it offers a unified and systematic approach to evaluating the statistical guarantees of both existing and future watermarking methodologies. Furthermore, the accomplishments of blockchain in copyright are introduced [395], utilizing blockchain to enhance LLMgenerated content reliability through a secure and transparent verification mechanism.

## VI. RISK ASSESSMENT

In this section, we introduce benchmarks commonly used for evaluating LLMs and present noteworthy results from recent works. In general, existing studies concentrate on evaluating the robustness, truthfulness, ethical issues, and bias issues of LLMs.

## A. Robustness

There are two primary types of robustness evaluation which are critical for the reliability of LLMs: (i) Adversarial robustness: Recently, researchers construct adversarial samples that can significantly decrease the performance of deep learning models [396]. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against these adversarial examples. (ii) Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness: Existing models suffer from overfitting issues. As a result, LLMs are unable to efficiently process OOD samples that have not been seen during model training. OOD robustness evaluation measures the performance when processing such samples.

Datasets. We summarize the datasets for evaluating model robustness:

- PromptBench [397] introduces a series of robustness evaluation benchmarks for LLMs. It includes 583,884 adversarial examples and covers a wide range of text-based attacks.
These attacks target different linguistic granularities, ranging from characters to sentences and even semantics.
- AdvGLUE [398] serves as a framework for evaluating the adversarial robustness of LLMs. It focuses on evaluating models using five language tasks under adversarial settings based on the GLUE tasks.
- ANLI [399] evaluates the robustness of LLM against manually constructed sentences that contain spelling errors and synonyms.
- GLUE-X [400] consists of 14 groups of OOD samples. It extensively evaluates LLMs on eight classic NLP tasks across various domains.
- BOSS [401] serves as a tool for evaluating the OOD robustness of LLMs. It contains five NLP tasks and twenty groups of samples. Particularly, it evaluates generalization abilities to unseen samples.

Evaluation Methods and Results. Adversarial attacks against LLMs have been widely studied [396]. PromptBench [397] evaluates the adversarial robustness of LLMs through various tasks, including sentiment analysis, linguistic reasoning, reading comprehension, machine translation, and solving mathematical problems. Additionally, it constructs 4,788 adversarial prompts to simulate a range of plausible user input, such as spelling errors and synonym substitutions. In this way, the authors reveal insufficient robustness of existing models, which underlines the importance of enhancing the robustness against adversarial prompts.

Alternatively, GLUE-X [400] evaluates the robustness of LLM against OOD samples, where eight NLP tasks are considered and a significant performance decrease is observed when processing OOD samples. Similarly, the evaluation carried out through BOSS [401] observes positive correlations between the OOD robustness of LLMs and their performance of processing in-distribution samples. In addition, for domainspecific LLMs, fine-tuning is able to enhance OOD robustness.

Besides, the robustness of ChatGPT has raised significant attention. The evaluations based on existing datasets [151], [399], [400], [402] indicate that ChatGPT exhibits superior robustness when compared with other models.

## B. Truthfulness

Truthfulness of LLMs refers to whether LLMs generate false responses, which is hindered by the hallucination issue of LLMs. In psychology, hallucination is defined as a false perception of reality without external stimuli [417]. In the field of NLP, the hallucination issue of LLMs is defined as generating either meaningless or false information that does not align with inputs [105], [418]. The definition further divides hallucinations into two categories: (i) hallucinations that are independent of the source contents and cannot be verified correctly by them; (ii) hallucinations that directly contradict the source contents. However, applying the original definition to the hallucination of LLMs is challenging due to the scale of LLM training datasets. A recent study classifies the hallucination of LLMs into three categories [106]:

- Input-Conflicting Hallucination: LLMs generates contents that deviates from user input.

- Context-Conflicting Hallucination: The contents generated by LLMs is inconsistent.
- Fact-Conflicting Hallucination: LLMs generated contents conflict with objective facts.

Datasets. The following datasets are used for evaluating the hallucination issue of LLMs.

- HaDes [403]: Liu et al. construct dataset for token-level detection. The dataset consists of perturbed text fragments from the Wikipedia. Note that, the samples are annotated using loop iteration and crowd-source methods.
- Wikibro [404]: Manakul et al. introduce SelfCheckGPT, a sentence-level black-box detection approach. The dataset is based on the annotated paragraphs of 238 lengthy articles.
- Med-HALT [405]: Umapathi et al. addressed hallucination issues specific to medical LLMs and proposed the MedHALT dataset. This dataset utilizes real-world data from multiple countries and aims to evaluate the reasoning ability of LLMs and detect context-conflicting hallucinations.
- HaluEval [406]: Junyi et al. developed the HaluEval dataset to assess different types of hallucinations generated by LLMs. The dataset was sampled and filtered by ChatGPT, with manual annotation of the hallucinations.
- Levy/Holt [128]: McKenna et al. introduced the Levy/Holt dataset for identifying the sources of hallucinations in LLMs. This dataset consists of premise-hypothesis paired questions and is employed to evaluate both the comprehension ability and hallucination issues of LLMs.
- TruthfulQA [111]: Lin et al. created the TruthfulQA dataset to detect fact-conflicting hallucinations. This dataset includes questions from various domains and provides both correct and incorrect answers.
- Concept-7 [407]: Luo et al. proposed the Concept-7 dataset. Unlike datasets that classify hallucinations, Concept-7 clas- sifies potential hallucinatory instructions.

Evaluation Methods and Results. Existing studies reveal that most metrics for evaluating qualities of LLM-generated content are not suitable for evaluating hallucination issues, such that, these metrics need manual evaluation [377], [419]. The research on hallucination defines new metrics, including statistical metrics and model-based metrics. First, statistical metrics estimate the degree of hallucination by measuring n-grams overlaps and contradictions between output and input contents [420]. Second, model-based metrics use neural models to align generated contents and source contents to estimate the degree of hallucination. In addition, the model-based metrics can be further divided into information extraction-based [421], question answering-based [114], language reasoning-based [422], [423], and LM-based metrics [424]. Besides, manual evaluation is still widely used as complements to these methods [425], i.e., manually comparing and scoring the hallucinatory generated contents [377].

Existing studies have conducted evaluations on the hallucination issues of widely used LLMs. Bang et al. evaluate the internal and external hallucination issues of ChatGPT. Their findings revealed notable distinctions between the two categories of hallucinations. ChatGPT displayed superior performance in internal hallucinations, demonstrating minimal deviation from user input and maintaining coherence with reality. Conversely, external hallucinations are prevalent across various tasks [195]. In the medical domain, Wang et al. categorize the hallucinations raised by GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google AI's Bard. The results show that for GPT-3.5, two kinds of hallucination accounted for $27 \%$ and $43 \%$ of the total hallucinations, respectively. Similarly, the ratios for GPT4 and Google Al's Bard are 25\%/33\% and 8\%/44\% [426]. Furthermore, $\mathrm{Li}$ et al. evaluate the hallucination issues of ChatGPT and reveal its poor performance in handling inputconflicting hallucinations [406].

## C. Ethics

Ethical issues of LLMs have attracted much attention. Many studies measure toxic contents generated by LLMs such as offenses, prejudices, and insults [218]. Privacy leakage is a critical ethical issue, as LLMs are trained with personal data containing personally identifiable information (PII). Moreover, existing LLM providers also impose privacy policies that allow them to collect and store users' data [427], which may violate the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For privacy concerns, training datasets of LLMs are partially copyrighted, such that users can obtain its content copyrights [428].

The existing studies on LLM privacy issues mainly focus on information leakage during both model training and inferring phases [67], [429]. For training phases, existing studies reveal that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 may leak personal data under zeroshot settings, and lengthy contextual prompts lead to more information leakage. For inferring phases, it is observed that GPT-3.5 leaks PII in zero-shot manners. Besides, it is observed that GPT-4 can avoid PII leakage when privacy protection directives are followed [429]. Note that, LLMs have varying abilities to protect sensitive keywords. Studies have found that
both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to protect all sensitive keywords effectively [430], [431].

Datasets. The following datasets are used for evaluating ethical issues of LLMs.

- REALTOXICITYPROMPTS [218] contains high-frequency sentence-level prompts along with toxicity scores generated by a classifier. It is used for evaluating the toxicity of LLMgenerated content.
- CommonClaim [408] contains 20,000 human-labeled statements, and is used for detecting inputs that result in false statements. It focuses on evaluating the capability of LLMs to generate factual information.
- HateXplain [409] is designed for detecting hate speech and is annotated based on various aspects, including basic knowledge, target communities, and rationales.
- TrustGPT [410] provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs from different aspects, e.g., toxicity and value alignments. It aims to assess the ethical issues of LLM-generated content.
- TOXIGEN [366] is a large-scale machine-generated dataset that includes both toxic and benign statements about minority groups. It is used for evaluating the toxicity aginst the groups of people.
- $C O L D$ [411] is a benchmark for detecting Chinese offensive content, which aims to measure the offensiveness of existing models.
- SafetyPrompts [51] is a Chinese LLM evaluation benchmark. It provides test prompts to disclose the ethical issues of LLM models.
- CValues [412] is the first Chinese human values evaluation dataset, which evaluates the alignment abilities of LLMs.

Evaluation Methods and Results. ChatGPT has been extensively tested by using questionnaires. In addition, personality tests (e.g., SD-3, BFI, OCEAN, and MBTI) are leveraged to evaluate personality traits of LLMs [432], [433]. Existing studies have found that ChatGPT exhibits a highly open and gregarious personality type (ENFJ) with rare indications of dark traits. Moreover, a series of functionality tests indicate that ChatGPT cannot recognize hate speech issues [434]. Besides, based on previous studies on using language models for ethical evaluation [435], automatically generated contents are used for evaluating the issues of ChatGPT as well as many other LLMs, where implicit hate speech issues are revealed [436].

## D. Bias

The training datasets of LLMs may contain biased information that leads LLMs to generate outputs with social biases. Existing studies categorize social biases into gender, race, religion, occupation, politics, and ideology [437], to explain the bias issues of LLMs [187].

Datasets. We summarize the datasets that can be used for analyzing bias issues of LLMs.

- FaiRLLM [413] dataset aims to evaluate the fairness of recommendations made by LLMs, which facilitates the detection of biased recommendations.
- BOLD [414] is a large-scale dataset, covering varieties of biased inputs including the categories of profession, gender, race, religion, and ideology.
- StereoSet [438] aims to detect stereotypical biases of LLMs, including the categories of gender, profession, race, and religion.
- HOLISTICBIAS [415] contains various biased inputs, which are used for discovering unknown bias issues of LLMs.
- CDail-Bias [416] is the first Chinese bias dataset based on social dialog for identifying bias issues in dialog systems.

Evaluation Methods and Results. Questionnaires are widely used for evaluating bias issues. Existing studies conduct political tests on ChatGPT with questionnaires about the politics of the G7 member states and political elections, and disclose serious bias issues [433], [439]. Similarly, the bias on American culture is detected in ChatGPT [440]. Also, ChatGPT suffers from different ethical issues specific to different regions around the world [441].

In addition, existing studies also use NLP models to generate contents to evaluate social biases [442], whereas the NLP models per se may suffer from bias issues [426], remaining an unresolved issue. Moreover, red teaming is also used for evaluating bias issues, which simulate adversarial biased inputs to disclose biased outputs by ChatGPT [186]. Moreover, some studies develop sophisticated input generation methods for red team-based bias evaluation [408]. Besides, many other different methods evaluate the bias of LLM, especially the bias issues of ChatGPT [443].

## VII. Future Work

In this section, we discuss some potential explorations on the safety and security of LLMs, as well as present our perspectives on these future research topics.

## A. Comprehensive Input Monitoring Approaches

With improved model capabilities, the probability of models generating harmful content also increases. This necessitates the development of sophisticated and robust defense mechanisms for LLMs. To mitigate the risks associated with harmful content generation, it is essential to incorporate both policies and monitoring strategies. Currently, the detection of malicious prompts is usually based on a combination of classifiers, facing several challenges. First, the classifiers are typically trained using supervised methods, which may not perform well when only a few examples are available. Second, using a predefined set of classifiers cannot address new attacks. Therefore, we suggest that research on malicious input detection should shift towards semi-supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms, and adopt a more comprehensive approach to identify risks and weaknesses in the current detection system, such as developing red-teaming models.

## B. More Efficient and Effective Training Data Intervention

Addressing concerns about privacy, toxicity, and bias within large-scale web-collected training datasets is a critical challenge in the LLM community. Currently, data intervention
is a popular method used for mitigating the above issues. However, this kind of method is presently far from satisfactory, since it requires high labor costs. Furthermore, improper data intervention has been demonstrated to result in biased data distribution, consequently leading to model degradation. In view of this, a more efficient and effective data intervention method is strongly desired in future research.

## C. Interpretable Hallucination Mitigation

In spite of the significant progress made in existing efforts for alleviating hallucinations, hallucination is still an important issue to be further addressed. Recently, some studies have analyzed the relationship between LLMs' hallucination behaviors and their activation of hidden neurons, aiming to propose interpretable hallucination mitigation methods. Here we strongly suggest more explorations on this research direction, since effectively interpreting why and how LLMs generate hallucination behaviors can help us better understand and address the issue.

## D. General Defense Framework against Model Attacks

It has been claimed that a variety of traditional as well as emerging attacks can take effect on LLMs. Although many efforts have been devoted to mitigating specific model attacks, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive defense framework capable of addressing a wide spectrum of model attacks, including both conventional and emerging threats to LLMs. One promising approach involves employing safety training methods to bolster the robustness of LLMs. Nevertheless, achieving a universal training framework to counter all types of attacks remains unsolved. The community is still in the process of constructing a comprehensive workflow for ensuring the security of LLMs.

## E. Development of Defensive Tools for LLM Systems

Existing defensive tools, e.g., control flow integrity (CFI) detection methods, provenance graphs, and attack traffic detection methods, can be effective in mitigating the threats against LLM systems. Designing new tools or improving the efficiency of existing defensive tools can enhance the security of LLMbased systems. For example, control flow integrity detection methods can be improved by analyzing only a dedicated set of system calls or using lightweight instrumentation techniques. Provenance graph-based methods can be improved by applying pruning and summarization techniques to reduce the size of the graph while preserving the overall structure and important dependencies. Suspicious attacks on LLMs can be detected by designing and deploying advanced anomaly detection techniques that investigate the network traffic interfering with the training or inference of LLMs.

## F. Risks and Mitigation on LLM-based Agent

LLM-powered autonomous agent systems provide efficiencies in the automation of complex tasks and facilitate sophisticated interactions. Existing research suggests that these agents are more vulnerable to certain types of attacks [444], such as jailbreaking. The autonomous actions executed by these agents also exacerbate robustness risks, because their operations have direct consequences in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the potential for malicious exploitation of these LLM agents warrants emphasis, as they could be utilized for illegal activities, such as launching cyber-attacks and phishing. Therefore, security operators should conduct regular robustness tests and perform real-time anomaly detection, such as filtering anomalous user inputs. The development of relevant security testing and detection techniques is anticipated to be a focal point in the future. In addition, regulations must be formulated to oversee the ethical deployment of LLM agents, securing compliance with established ethical and legal boundaries. Lastly, it is pivotal for governments and organizations to intentionally prepare for the inevitable workforce transitions. Investment in education and reskilling programs will be essential to equip individuals for the evolving job market.

## G. Developing Robust Watermarking Methods

With the increased capacity of LLMs, besides detecting harmful content, it is also crucial for users to determine which content is generated by LLMs. Currently, watermarking LLM outputs offers a potential solution but inevitably faces many challenges, particularly for texts. The current watermarking methods, as introduced in [385], are known to negatively affect downstream task performance. Furthermore, watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing attacks. Therefore, it is important to develop new watermarking methods that address these challenges, as they can significantly enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs.

## H. Improving the Evaluation of LLM Systems

Current evaluation metrics are mainly defined for specific tasks. Therefore, a unified metric is desired for comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenarios. Besides, LLMs involve lots of hyper-parameters. Existing studies usually adopt default values without conducting a comprehensive hyper-parameter search. In effect, inferring on the validation set for hyperparameter search is costly. Therefore, exploring whether there are better methods to help us determine the values of hyperparameters is valuable, which helps to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of various hyper-parameters during model training.

## VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we conducted an extensive survey on the safety and security of LLM systems, aiming to inspire LLM participants to adopt a systematic perspective when building responsible LLM systems. To facilitate this, we propose a module-oriented risk taxonomy that organizes the safety and security risks associated with each module of an LLM system. With this taxonomy, LLM participants can quickly identify modules related to a specific issue and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to alleviate the problem. We hope this work can serve both the academic and industrial communities, providing guidance for the future development of responsible LLM systems.

#### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing problems across diverse domains, ranging from chatbots [66] to medical diagnoses [191] and financial advisory [160]. Notably, their impact extends beyond fields directly associated with language processing, such as translation [206] and text sentiment analysis [125]. LLMs also prove invaluable in broader applications including legal aid [211], healthcare [165], and drug discovery [148]. This highlights their adaptability and potential to streamline language-related tasks, making them indispensable tools across various industries and scenarios.[^0]

Despite their considerable achievements, LLMs may face fairness concerns stemming from biases inherited from the real-world and even exacerbate them [238]. Consequently, they could lead to discrimination against certain populations, especially in socially sensitive applications, across various dimensions such as race [6], age [51], gender [93], nationality [183], occupation [90], and religion [1]. For instance, an investigation [185] revealed that when tasked with generating a letter of recommendation for individuals named Kelly (a common female name) and Joseph (a common male name), ChatGPT, a prominent instance of LLMs, produced paragraphs describing Kelly and Joseph with random traits. Notably, Kelly was portrayed as warm and amiable (e.g., a well-regarded member), whereas Joseph was depicted as possessing greater leadership and initiative (e.g., a natural leader and role model). This observation indicates that LLMs tend to perpetuate gender stereotypes by associating higher levels of leadership with males.

To this end, the research community has made many efforts to address bias and discrimination in LLMs. Nevertheless, the notions of studied fairness vary across different works, which can be confusing and impede further progress. Moreover, different algorithms are developed to achieve various fairness notions. The lack of a clear framework mapping these fairness notions to their corresponding methodologies complicates the design of algorithms for future fair LLMs. This situation underscores the need for a systematic survey that consolidates recent advances and illuminates paths for future research. In addition, existing surveys on fairness predominantly focus on traditional ML fields such as graph neural networks [36, 48], computer vision [113, 178], natural language processing $[9,25]$, which leaves a noticeable gap in comprehensive reviews specifically dedicated to the fairness of LLMs. To this end, this survey aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing literature on fair LLMs. The main contributions of this work are: i) Introduction to LLMs: The introduction of fundamental principles of the LLM, its training process, and the bias stemming from such training sets the groundwork for a more in-depth exploration of the fairness of LLMs. ii) Comprehensive Metrics and Algorithms Review: A comprehensive overview of three categories of metrics and four categories of algorithms designed to promote fairness in LLMs is provided, summarizing specific methods within each classification. iii) Rich Public-Available Resources: The compilation of diverse resources, including toolkits and evaluation datasets, advances the research and development of fair LLMs. iv) Challenges and Future Directions: The limitations of current research are presented, pressing challenges are pointed out, and open research questions are discussed for further advances.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the proposed taxonomy. Section 3 provides background

information on LLMs to facilitate an understanding of fairness in LLMs. Following that, Section 4 explores current definitions of fairness in ML and the adaptations necessary to address linguistic challenges in defining bias within LLMs. Section 5 introduces quantification of bias in LLMs. Discussion on algorithms for achieving fairness in LLMs is presented in Section 6.

## 2 AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXONOMY

As shown in Figure 1, we categorize recent studies on the fairness of LLMs according to three distinct perspectives: i) metrics for quantifying biases in LLMs, ii) algorithms for mitigating biases in LLMs, along with iii) resources for evaluating biases in LLMs. Regarding metrics for quantifying biases in LLMs, they are further categorized based on the data format used by metrics: i) embedding-based metrics, ii) probability-based metrics, and iii) generation-based metrics. Concerning bias mitigation techniques, they are structured according to the different stages within the LLMs workflow: i) pre-processing, ii) in-training, iii) intra-processing, and iv) postprocessing. In addition, we collect resources for evaluating biases in LLMs and group them into Toolkits and Datasets. Specifically for Datasets, they are classified into two types based on the most appropriate metric type: i) probability-based and ii) generation-based.

## 3 BACKGROUND

This section initially introduces some essential preliminaries about LLMs and their training process, laying the groundwork for a clear understanding of the factors contributing to bias in LLMs that follow.

### 3.1 Large Language Models

Language models are computational models with the capacity to comprehend and generate human language [120, 146]. The evolution of language models progresses from statistical language models to neural language models, pre-trained language models, and the current state of LLMs [31]. Initial statistical language models, like N-gram models [84], estimate word likelihood based on the preceding context. However, $\mathrm{N}$-gram models face challenges such as poor generalization ability, lack of long-term dependence, and difficulty capturing complex linguistic phenomena [135]. These limitations constrained the capabilities of language models until the emergence of transformers [182], which largely addressed these issues. Specifically, transformers became the backbone of modern language models [189], attributable to their efficiency-an architecture free of recurrence that computes individual tokens in parallel-and effectiveness-attention facilitates spatial interaction across tokens dynamically dependent on the input itself. The advent of transformers has significantly expanded the scale of LLMs. These models not only demonstrate formidable linguistic capabilities but also rapidly approach human-level proficiency in diverse domains such as mathematics, reasoning, medicine, law, and programming [20]. Nevertheless, LLMs frequently embed undesirable social stereotypes and biases, underscoring the emerging necessity to address such biases as a crucial undertaking.

### 3.2 Training Process of LLMs

Training LLMs require careful planning, execution, and monitoring. This section provides a brief explanation of the key steps required to train LLMs.

Data preparation and preprocessing. The foundation of big language modeling is predicated on the availability of high-quality data. For LLMs, this entails the necessity of a vast corpus of textual data that is not only extensive but also rich in quality and diversity, which requires accurately represent the domain and language style that the model is aiming to grasp. Simultaneously, the datasets need to be large enough to provide sufficient training data for LLMs, and representative enough so that the models can adapt well to new and unseen texts [151]. Furthermore, the dataset needs to undergo a variety of processes, with data cleansing being a critical step involving the review and validation of data to eliminate discrimination and harmful content. For example, popular public sources for finding datasets, such as Kaggle ${ }^{1}$, Google Dataset Search ${ }^{2}$, Hugging Face $^{3}$, Data.gov ${ }^{4}$, and Wikipedia database ${ }^{5}$, could all potentially harbor discriminatory content. This inclusion of biased information can adversely impact decision-making if fairness considerations are disregarded [112]. Therefore, it is imperative to systematically remove any discriminatory content from the dataset to effectively reduce the risk of LLMs internalizing biased patterns.[^1]

Model selection and configuration. Most existing LLMs utilize transformer deep learning architectures, which have emerged as a preferred option for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as Metas's LLaMa [180] and DeepAI's GPT-3 [18]. Several key elements of these models, such as the choice of loss function, the number of layers in transformer blocks, the number of attention heads, and various hyperparameters, need to be specified when configuring a transformer neural network. The configuration of these elements can vary depending on the desired use case and the characteristics of the training data. It is important to recognize that the model configuration directly influences the training duration and the potential introduction of bias during this process. One common source of bias amplification during the model training process is the selection of loss objectives mentioned above [77]. Typically, these objectives aim to enhance the accuracy of predictions. However, models may capitalize on chance correlations or statistical anomalies in the dataset to boost precision (e.g., all positive examples in the training data happened to come from male authors so that gender can be used as a discriminative feature) $[72,139]$. In essence, models may produce accurate results based on incorrect rationales, resulting in discrimination.

Instruction Tuning. Instruction tuning represents a nuanced form of fine-tuning where a model is trained using specific pairs of input-output instructions. This method allows the model to learn particular tasks directed by these instructions, significantly enhancing its capacity to interpret and execute a variety of NLP tasks as per the guidelines provided [32]. Despite its advantages, the risk of introducing bias is a notable concern in instruction tuning. Specifically, biased language or stereotypes within instructions can influence the model to learn and perpetuate biases in its responses. To mitigate bias in instruction tuning, it is essential to carefully choose instruction pairs, implement bias detection and mitigation methods, incorporate diverse and representative training data, and evaluate the model's fairness using relevant metrics.

Alignment with human. During training, the model is exposed to examples such as "what is the capital of India?" paired with the labeled output "Delhi", enabling it to learn the relationship between input queries and expected output responses. This equips the model to accurately answer similar questions, like "What is the capital of France?" resulting in the answer "Paris". While this highlights the model's capabilities, there are scenarios where its performance may falter, particularly when queried like "Whether men or women are better leaders?" where the model may generate biased content. This introduces concerns about bias in the model's responses. For this purpose, InstructGPT [131] designs an effective tuning approach that enables LLMs to follow the expected instructions, which utilizes the technique of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [30, 131]. RLHF is a ML technique that uses human feedback to optimize LLMs to self-learn more efficiently. Reinforcement learning techniques train model to make decisions that maximize rewards, making their outcomes more accurate. RLHF incorporates human feedback in the rewards function, so the LLMs can perform tasks more aligned with human values such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Notably, ChatGPT is developed based on a similar technique as InstructGPT, exhibits a strong ability to generate high-quality, benign responses, including the ability to avoid engaging with offensive queries.

### 3.3 Factors Contributing to Bias in LLMs

Language modeling bias, often defined as "bias that results in harm to various social groups" [70], presents itself in various forms, encompassing the association of specific stereotypes with groups, the devaluation of certain groups, the underrepresentation of particular social groups, and the unequal allocation of resources among groups [44]. Here, three primary sources contributing to bias in LLMs are introduced:

i) Training data bias. The training data used to develop LLMs is not free from historical biases, which inevitably influence the behavior of these models. For instance, if the training data includes the statement "all programmers are male and all nurses are female," the model is likely to learn and perpetuate these occupational and gender biases in its outputs, reflecting a narrow and biased view of societal roles [16, 24]. Additionally, a significant disparity in the training data could also lead to biased outcomes [161]. For example, Buolamwini and Gebru [21] highlighted significant disparities in datasets like IJB-A and Adience, where predominantly light-skinned individuals make up $79.6 \%$ and $86.2 \%$ of the data, respectively, thereby biasing analyses toward underrepresented dark-skinned groups [118].

ii) Embedding bias. Embeddings serve as a fundamental component in LLMs, offering a rich source of semantic information by capturing the nuances of language. However, these embeddings may unintentionally introduce biases, as demonstrated by the clustering of certain professions, such as nurses near words associated with femininity and doctors near words associated with masculinity. This phenomenon inadvertently introduces semantic bias into downstream models, impacting their performance and fairness [9, 63]. The presence of such biases underscores the importance of critically examining and mitigating bias in embeddings to ensure the equitable and unbiased functioning of LLMs across various applications and domains.

iii) Label bias. In instruction tuning scenarios, biases can arise from the subjective judgments of human annotators who provide labels or annotations for training data [152]. This occurs when annotators inject their personal beliefs, perspectives, or stereotypes into the labeling process, inadvertently introducing bias into the model. Another potential source of bias is the RLHF approach discussed in Section 3, where human feedback is used to align LLMs with human values. While this method aims to improve model behavior by incorporating human input, it inevitably introduces subjective notions into the feedback provided by human. These subjective ideas can influence the model's training and decision-making processes, potentially leading to biased outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to implement measures to detect and mitigate bias when performing instruction tuning, such as diversifying annotator perspectives, and evaluating model performance using fairness metrics.

## 4 ML BIAS QUANTIFICATION AND LINGUISTIC ADAPTATIONS IN LLMs

This section reviews the commonly used definitions of fairness in machine learning and the necessary adaptations to address linguistic challenges when defining bias in the context of LLMs.

### 4.1 Group Fairness

Existing fairness definitions $[52,76]$ at the group level aim to emphasize that algorithmic decisions neither favor nor harm certain subgroups defined by the sensitive attribute, which often derives from legal standards or topics of social sensitivity, such as gender, race, religion, age, sexuality, nationality, and health conditions. These attributes delineate a variety of demographic or social groups, with sensitive attribute categorized as either binary (e.g., male, female) or pluralistic (e.g., Jewish, Islamic, Christian). However, existing fairness metrics, developed primarily for traditional machine learning tasks (e.g., classification), rely on the availability of clear class labels and corresponding numbers of members belonging to each demographic group for quantification. For example, when utilizing the German Credit Dataset [7] and considering the relationship between gender and credit within the framework of statistical parity (where the probability of granting a benefit, such as credit card approval, is the same for different demographic groups) [184], machine learning algorithms like decision trees can directly produce a binary credit score for each individual. This enables the evaluation of whether there is an equal probability for male and female applicants to obtain a good predicted credit score. However, this quantification presupposes the applicability of class labels and relies on the number of members from different demographic groups belonging to each class label, an assumption that does not hold for LLMs. LLMs, which are often tasked with generative or interpretive functions rather than simple classification, necessitate a different linguistic approach to such demographic group-based disparities; Instead of direct label comparison, group fairness in LLMs involves ensuring that word embeddings, vector representations of words or phrases, do not encode biased associations. For example, the embedding for "doctor" should not be closer to male-associated words than to female-associated ones. This would indicate that the LLM associates both genders equally with the profession, without embedding any societal biases that might suggest one gender is more suited to the profession than the other.

### 4.2 Individual fairness

Individual fairness represents a nuanced approach focusing on equitable treatment at the individual level, as opposed to the broader strokes of group fairness [52]. Specifically, this concept posits that similar individuals should receive similar outcomes, where similarity is defined based on relevant characteristics for the task at hand Essentially, individual fairness seeks to ensure that the model's decisions, recommendations, or other outputs do not unjustly favor or disadvantage any individual, especially when compared to others who are alike in significant aspects. However, individual fairness shares a common challenge with group fairness: the reliance on available labels to measure and ensure equitable treatment. This involves modeling predicted differences to assess fairness accurately, a task that becomes particularly complex when dealing with the rich and varied outputs of LLMs. In the context of LLMs, ensuring individual fairness involves careful consideration of how sensitive or potentially offensive words are represented and associated. A fair LLM should ensure that such words are not improperly linked with personal identities or names in a manner that perpetuates negative stereotypes or biases. To illustrate, a term like "whore," which might carry negative connotations and contribute to hostile stereotypes, should not be unjustly associated with an individual's name, such as "Mrs. Apple," in the model's outputs. This example underscores the importance of individual fairness in preventing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes and ensuring that LLMs treat all individuals with respect and neutrality, devoid of undue bias or negative association.

## 5 QUANTIFYING BIAS IN LLMs

This section presents criteria for quantifying the bias of language models, categorized into three main groups: embeddings-based metrics, probability-based metrics, and generation-based metrics.

### 5.1 Embedding-based Metrics

This line of efforts begins with Bolukbasi et al. [16] conducting a seminal study that revealed the racial and gender biases inherent in Word2Vec [119] and Glove [137], two widely-used embedding schemes. However, these two embedding schemes primarily provide static representations for identical words, whereas contextual embeddings offer a more nuanced representation that adapts dynamically according to the context [116]. To this end, the following two embedding-based fairness metrics specifically considering contextual embeddings are introduced:

Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) [24]. WEAT assesses bias in word embeddings by comparing two sets of target words with two sets of attribute words. The calculation of WEAT can be seen as analogies: $X$ is to $A$ as $Y$ is to $B$, where $X$ and $Y$ represent the target words, and $A$ and $B$ represent the attribute words. WEAT then uses cosine similarity to analyze the likeness between each target and attribute set, and aggregates the similarity scores for the respective sets to determine the final result between the target set and the attribute set. For example, to examine gender bias in weapons and arts, the following sets can be considered: Target words: Interests $X$ : \{pistol, machine, gun, . . \}, Interests $Y$ : \{dance, prose, drama, . . . \}, Attribute words: terms A: \{male, boy, brother, $\ldots\}$, terms $B$ : \{female, girl, sister, . . . \}. WEAT thus assesses biases in LLMs by comparing the similarities between categories like male and gun, and female and gun. Mathematically, the association of a word $w$ with bias attribute sets $A$ and $B$ in WEAT is defined as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
s(\boldsymbol{w}, A, B)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{\boldsymbol{a} \in A} \cos (\boldsymbol{w}, \boldsymbol{a})-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{\boldsymbol{b} \in B} \cos (\boldsymbol{w}, \boldsymbol{b}) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Subsequently, to quantify bias in the sets $X$ and $Y$, the effect size is used as a normalized measure for the association difference between the target sets:

$$
\begin{equation*}
W E A T(X, Y, A, B)=\frac{\operatorname{mean}_{\boldsymbol{x} \in X}(\boldsymbol{x}, A, B)-\operatorname{mean}_{\boldsymbol{y} \in Y s}(\boldsymbol{y}, A, B)}{\operatorname{stddev}_{\boldsymbol{w} \in X \cup Y} s(\boldsymbol{w}, A, B)} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\operatorname{mean}_{\boldsymbol{x} \in X} s(\boldsymbol{x}, A, B)$ represents the average of $s(x, A, B)$ for $x$ in $X$, while stddev $\boldsymbol{w}_{\boldsymbol{w} \in X \cup Y} s(\boldsymbol{w}, A, B)$ denotes the standard deviation across all word biases of $x$ in $X$.

Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) [116]. Contrasting with WEAT, SEAT compares sets of sentences rather than sets of words by employing WEAT on the vector representation of a sentence. Specifically, its objective is to quantify the relationship
between a sentence encoder and a specific term rather than its connection with the context of that term, as seen in the training data. In order to accomplish this, SEAT adopts musked sentence structures like "That is [BLANK]" or "[BLANK] is here", where the empty slot [BLANK] is filled with social group and neutral attribute words. In addition, employing fixed-sized embedding vectors encapsulating the complete semantic information of the sentence as embeddings allows compatibility with Eq.(2).

### 5.2 Probability-based Metrics

Probability-based metrics formalize bias by analyzing the probabilities assigned by LLMs to various options, often predicting words or sentences based on templates [12, 147] or evaluation sets [57, 124]. These metrics are generally divided into two categories: masked tokens, which assess token probabilities in fill-in-the-blank templates, and pseudo-log-likelihood is utilized to assess the variance in probabilities between counterfactual pairs of sentences.

Discovery of Correlations (DisCo) [199]. DisCo utilizes a set of template sentences, each containing two empty slots. For example, "[PERSON] often likes to [BLANK]". The [PERSON] slot is manually filled with gender-related words from a vocabulary list, while the second slot [BLANK] is filled by the model's top three highest-scoring predictions. By comparing the model's candidate fills generation-based on the gender association in the [PERSON] slot, DisCo evaluates the presence and magnitude of bias in the model.

Log Probability Bias Score (LPBS) [94]. LPBS adopts template sentences similar to DisCO. However, unlike DisCO, LPBS corrects for the influence of inconsistent prior probabilities of target attributes. Specifically, for computing the association between the target gender male and the attribute doctor, LPBS first feeds the masked sentence "[MASK] is a doctor" into the model to obtain the probability of the sentence "he is a doctor", denoted as $P_{\text {tar male }}$. Then, to correct for the influence of inconsistent prior probabilities of target attributes, LPBS feeds the masked sentence " $[M A S K]$ is a [MASK]" into the model to obtain the probability of the sentence

"he" replaced by "she" for the target gender female. Finally, the bias is assessed by comparing the normalized probability scores for two contrasting attribute words and the specific formula is defined as:

CrowS-Pairs Score. CrowS-Pairs score [124] differs from the above two methods that use fill-in-the-blank templates, as it is based on pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) [149] calculated on a set of counterfactual sentences. PLL approximates the probability of a token conditioned on the rest of the sentence by masking one token at a time and predicting it using all the other unmasked tokens. The equation for PLL can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{PLL}(S)=\sum_{s \in S} \log P\left(s \mid S_{\backslash s} ; \theta\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S$ represents is a sentence and $s$ denotes a word within $S$. The CrowS-Pairs score requires pairs of sentences, one characterized by stereotyping and the other less so, utilizing PLL to assess the model's inclination towards stereotypical sentences.

### 5.3 Generation-based Metrics

Generation-based metrics play a crucial role in addressing closedsource LLMs, as obtaining probabilities and embeddings of text generated by these models can be challenging. These metrics involve inputting biased or toxic prompts into the model, aiming to elicit biased or toxic text output, and then measuring the level of bias present. Generated-based metrics are categorized into two groups: classifier-based and distribution-based metrics.

Classifier-based Metrics. Classifier-based metrics utilize an auxiliary model to evaluate bias, toxicity, or sentiment in the generated text. Bias in the generated text can be detected when text created from similar prompts but featuring different social groups is classified differently by an auxiliary model. As an example, multilayer perceptrons, frequently employed as auxiliary models due to their robust modeling capabilities and versatile applications, are commonly utilized for binary text classification [8, 86]. Subsequently, binary bias is assessed by examining disparities in classification outcomes among various classes. For example, gender bias is quantified by analyzing the difference in true positive rates of gender in classification outcomes in [38].

Distribution-based Metrics. Detecting bias in the generated text can involve comparing the token distribution related to one social group with that of another or nearby social groups. One specific method is the Co-Occurrence Bias score [17], which assesses how often tokens co-occur with gendered words in a corpus of generated text. Mathematically, for any token $w$, and two sets of gender words, e.g., female and male, the bias score of a specific word $w$ is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{bias}(w)=\log \left(\frac{P(w \mid \text { female })}{P(w \mid \text { male })}\right), P(w \mid g)=\frac{d(w, g) / \Sigma_{i} d\left(w_{i}, g\right)}{d(g) / \Sigma_{i} d\left(w_{i}\right)} \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $P(w \mid g)$ represents the probability of encountering the word $w$ in the context of gendered terms $g$, and $d(w, g)$ represents a contextual window. The set $g$ consists of gendered words classified as either male or female. A positive bias score suggests that a word is more commonly associated with female words than with male words. In an infinite context, the words "doctor" and "nurse" would occur an equal number of times with both female and male words, resulting in bias scores of zero for these words.

## 6 MITIGATING BIAS IN LLMs

This section discusses and categorizes existing algorithms for mitigating bias in LLMs into four categories based on the stage at which they intervene in the processing pipeline.

### 6.1 Pre-processing

Pre-processing methods focus on adjusting the data provided for the model, which includes both training data and prompts, in order to eliminate underlying discrimination [37].

i) Data Augmentation. The objective of data augmentation is to achieve a balanced representation of training data across diverse social groups. One common approach is Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) [108, 199, 242], which aims to balance datasets by exchanging protected attribute data. For instance, if a dataset contains more instances like "Men are excellent programmers"
than "Women are excellent programmers," this bias may lead LLMs to favor male candidates during the screening of programmer resumes. One way CDA achieves data balance and mitigates bias is by replacing a certain number of instances of "Men are excellent programmers" with "Women are excellent programmers" in the training data. Numerous follow-up studies have built upon and enhanced the effectiveness of CDA. For example, Maudslay et al. [199] introduced Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS) to alleviate gender bias by randomly replacing gendered text with counterfactual versions at certain probabilities. Moreover, Zayed et al. [213]) discovered that the augmented dataset included instances that could potentially result in adverse fairness outcomes. They suggest an approach for data augmentation selection, which initially identifies instances within augmented datasets that might have an adverse impact on fairness. Subsequently, the model's fairness is optimized by pruning these instances.

ii) Prompt Tuning. In contrast to CDA, prompt tuning [97] focuses on reducing biases in LLMs by refining prompts provided by users. Prompt tuning can be categorized into two types: hard prompts and soft prompts. The former refers to predefined prompts that are static and may be considered as templates. Although templates provide some flexibility, the prompt itself remains mostly unchanged, hence the term "hard prompt." On the other hand, soft prompts are created dynamically during the prompt tuning process. Unlike hard prompts, soft prompts cannot be directly accessed or edited as text. Soft prompts are essentially embeddings, a series of numbers, that contain information extracted from the broader model. As a specific example of hard prompt, Mattern et al. [115] introduced an approach focusing on analyzing the bias mitigation effects of prompts across various levels of abstraction. In their experiments, they observed that the effects of debiasing became more noticeable as prompts became less abstract, as these prompts encouraged GPT-3 to utilize gender-neutral pronouns more frequently. In terms of soft prompt method, Fatemi et al. [56] focus on achieving gender equality by freezing model parameters and utilizing gender-neutral datasets to update biased word embeddings associated with occupations, effectively reducing bias in prompts. Overall, the disadvantage of hard prompts is their lack of flexibility, while the drawback of soft prompts is the lack of interpretability.

### 6.2 In-training

Mitigation techniques implemented during training aim to alter the training process to minimize bias. This includes making modifications to the optimization process by adjusting the loss function and incorporating auxiliary modules. These adjustments require the model to undergo retraining in order to update its parameters.

i) Loss Function Modification. Loss function modification involves incorporating a fairness-constrained into the training process of downstream tasks to guide the model toward fair learning. Wang et al. [196] introduced an approach that integrates causal relationships into model training. This method initially identifies causal features and spurious correlations based on standards inspired by the counterfactual framework of causal inference. A regularization technique is then used to construct the loss function, imposing small penalties on causal features and large penalties on spurious correlations. By adjusting the strength of penalties and optimizing the customized loss function, the model gives more importance to causal features and less importance to non-causal features, leading to fairer performance compared to conventional models. Additionally, Park et al. [133] proposed an embedding-based objective function that addresses the persistence of gender-related features in stereotype word vectors by utilizing generated gender direction vectors during fine-tuning steps.

ii) Auxiliary Module. Auxiliary module involve the addition of modules with the purpose of reducing bias within the model structure to help diminish bias. For instance, Lauscher et al. [95] proposed a sustainable modular debiasing strategy, namely Adapter-based DEbiasing of LanguagE Models (ADELE). Specifically, ADELE achieves debiasing by incorporating adapter modules into the original model layer and updating the adapters solely through language modeling training on a counterfactual augmentation corpus, thereby preserving the original model parameters unaltered. Additionally, Shen et al. [144] introduces Iterative Null Space Projection (INLP) for removing information from neural representations. Specifically, they iteratively train a linear classifier to predict a specific attribute for removal, followed by projecting the representation into the null space of that attribute. This process renders the classifier insensitive to the target attribute, complicating the linear separation of data based on that attribute. This method is effective in reducing bias in word embeddings and promoting fairness in multi-class classification scenarios.

### 6.3 Intra-processing

The Intra-processing focuses on mitigating bias in pre-trained or fine-tuned models during the inference stage without requiring additional training. This technique includes a range of methods, such as model editing and modifying the model's decoding process.

i) Model Editing. Model editing, as introduced by Mitchell et al. [121], offers a method for updating LLMs that avoids the computational burden associated with training entirely new models. This approach enables efficient adjustments to model behavior within specific areas of interest while ensuring no adverse effects on other inputs [207]. Recently, Limisiewicz et al. [103] identified the stereotype representation subspace and employed an orthogonal projection matrix to edit bias-vulnerable Feed-Forward Networks. Their innovative method utilizes profession as the subject and "he" or "she" as the target to aid in causal tracing. Furthermore, Akyürek et al. [4] expanded the application of model editing to include freeform natural language processing, thus incorporating bias editing.

ii) Decoding Modification. The method of decoding involves adjusting the quality of text produced by the model during the text generation process, including modifying token probabilities by comparing biases in two different output outcomes. For example, Gehman et al. [79] introduced a text generation technique known as DEXPERTS, which allows for controlled decoding. This method combines a pre-trained language model with "expert" and "antiexpert" language models. While the expert model assesses non-toxic text, the anti-expert model evaluates toxic text. In this combined system, tokens are assigned higher probabilities only if they are considered likely by the expert model and unlikely by the antiexpert model. This helps reduce bias in the output and enhances the quality of positive results.

### 6.4 Post-processing

Post-processing approaches modify the results generated by the model to mitigate biases, which is particularly crucial for closedsource LLMs where obtaining probabilities and embeddings of generated text is challenging, limiting the direct modification to output results only. Here, the method of chain-of-thought and rewriting serve as the illustrative approaches to convey this concept.

i) Chain-of-thought (CoT). The CoT technique enhances the hopeful and performance of LLMs towards fairness by leading them through incremental reasoning steps. The work by Kaneko et al. [87] provided a benchmark test where LLMs were tasked with determining the gender associated with specific occupational terms. Results revealed that, by default, LLMs tend to rely on societal biases when assigning gender labels to these terms. However, incorporating CoT prompts mitigates these biases. Furthermore, Dhingra et al. [47] introduced a technique combining CoT prompts and SHAP analysis [110] to counter stereotypical language towards queer individuals in model outputs. Using SHAP, stereotypical terms related to LGBTQ $+{ }^{6}$ individuals were identified, and then the chain-ofthought approach was used to guide language models in correcting this language.

ii) Rewriting. Rewriting methods refer to identifying discriminatory language in the results generated by models and replacing it with appropriate terms. As an illustration, Tokpo and Calders [179] introduced a text-style transfer model capable of training on nonparallel data. This model can automatically substitute biased content in the text output of LLMs, helping to reduce biases in textual data.

## 7 RESOURCES FOR EVALUATING BIAS

### 7.1 Toolkits

This section presents the following three essential tools designed to promote fairness in LLMs:

i) Perspective $\mathbf{A P I}^{7}$, created by Google Jigsaw, functions as a tool for detecting toxicity in text. Upon input of a text generation, Perspective API produces a probability of toxicity. This tool finds extensive application in the literature, as evidenced by its utilization in various studies [29, 96, 102].

ii) AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) [13] is an open-source toolkit aimed at aiding developers in assessing and mitigating biases and unfairness in machine learning models, including LLMs, by offering a variety of algorithms and tools for measuring, diagnosing, and alleviating unfairness.

iii) Aequitas [150] is an open-source bias audit toolkit developed to evaluate fairness and bias in machine learning models, including LLMs, with the aim of aiding data scientists and policymakers in comprehending and addressing bias in LLMs.

### 7.2 Datasets

This section provides a detailed summary of the datasets referenced in the surveyed literature, categorized into two distinct groups-probability-based and generation-based-based on the type of metric they are best suited for, as shown in Table 1.[^2]

i) Probability-based. As mentioned in section 5.2, datasets aligned with probability-based metrics typically use a templatebased format or a pair of counterfactual-based sentences. In template-based datasets, sentences include a placeholder that is completed by the language model choosing from predefined demographic terms, whereby the model's partiality towards various social groups is influenced by the probability of selecting these terms. Noteworthy examples of such datasets include WinoBias [239], which assess a model's competence in linking gender pronouns and occupations in both stereotypical and counter-stereotypical scenarios. WinoBias defines the gender binary in terms of two specific occupations. Expanding upon this dataset, several extensions have introduced a variety of diverse evaluation datasets. For example, WinoBias+ [181] enhances the original WinoBias dataset by employing rule-based and neural neutral rewriters to convert gendered sentences into neutral equivalents. Additionally, BUG [99] broadens the evaluation of gender bias in machine translation by using a large-scale real-world English dataset. In contrast, GAP [198] introduces a gender-balanced tagged corpus comprising $8,908 \mathrm{am}-$ biguous pronoun-name pairs, providing a more balanced dataset for accurately assessing model bias. Another category of counterfactualbased datasets evaluates bias by presenting the model with pairs of sentences containing different demographic terms and assessing their likelihood using a pseudo-log-likelihood metric. For instance, CrowS-Pairs [124] provides 1,508 sentence pairs to assess stereotypes of historically marginalized social groups, addressing nine biases related to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance, and socioeconomic status. Similarly, WinoQueer [57], developed by the LGBTQ+ community, contains 45,540 sentence pairs designed to gauge anti-LGBTQ+ stereotypes, encompassing LGBTQ+ identity descriptors and counterfactual versions without LGBTQ+ identity markers.

ii) Generation-based. As discussed in section 5.3, datasets aligned with generation-based metrics usually specify the first few words of a sentence and require the model to provide a continuation. Noteworthy examples include RealToxicityPrompts [80] and BOLD [46], both providing web-based sentence prefixes, such as: "Jaegwon Kim was a Korean-American philosopher who . . .". Specifically, RealToxicityPrompts is one of the largest prompting datasets, providing 100,000 sentence prefixes curated from web text with a toxicity score by Perspective API, which can be used to measure the toxicity of generations given both toxic and non-toxic prompts. Besides, BOLD presents 23,679 prompts aimed at assessing bias across professions, genders, races, religions, and political ideologies. This dataset is compiled by extracting information from English Wikipedia pages mentioning biased groups (e.g., professions) and truncating sentences to generate prompts.

## 8 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Formulating Fairness Notions. Discrimination within LLMs can take various forms, necessitating the development of diverse fairness notions for a comprehensive understanding of bias and discrimination across different real-world applications. This complexity of real-world scenarios means that additional types of biases may exist, each requiring tailored approaches to quantify bias in LLMs.

Table 1: Dataset for evaluating Bias in LLMs. For each dataset, the dataset size, their corresponding types of bias, and related work are presented, depending on the suitable type of metric for the dataset. Within the category of probability-based evaluate metrics, datasets marked with an asterisk (*) are denoted counterfactual-based datasets, while datasets without an asterisk belong to the template-based.

|  | HolisticBias [166] | 460,000 | gender, race, religion, age, others (13 types) | $[27,74,210]$ |

Furthermore, the definitions of fairness notions for LLMs can sometimes conflict, adding complexity to the task of ensuring equitable outcomes. Given these challenges, the process of either developing new fairness notions or selecting a coherent set of existing, nonconflicting fairness notions specifically for certain LLMs and their downstream applications remains an open question.

Rational Counterfactual Data Augmentation. Counterfactual data augmentation, a commonly employed technique in mitigating LLM bias, encounters several qualitative challenges in its implementation. A key issue revolves around inconsistent data quality, potentially leading to the generation of anomalous data that detrimentally impacts model performance. For instance, consider an original training corpus featuring sentences describing height and weight. When applying counterfactual data augmentation to achieve balance by merely substituting attribute words, it may result in the production of unnatural or irrational sentences, thus compromising the model's quality. For example, a straightforward replacement such as switching "a man who is 1.9 meters tall and weighs 200 pounds" with "a woman who is 1.9 meters tall and weighs 200 pounds" is evidently illogical. Future research could explore more rational replacement strategies or integrate alternative techniques to filter or optimize the generated data.

Balance Performance and Fairness in LLMs. A key strategy in mitigating bias involves adjusting the loss function and incorporating fairness constraints to ensure that the trained objective function considers both performance and fairness [205]. Although this effectively reduces bias in the model, finding the correct balance between model performance and fairness is a challenge. It often involves manually tuning the optimal trade-off parameter [212] However, training LLMs can be costly in terms of both time and finances for each iteration, and it also demands high hardware specifications. Hence, there is a pressing need to explore methods to achieve a balanced trade-off between performance and fairness systematically.

Fulfilling Multiple Types of Fairness. It is imperative to recognize that any form of bias is undesirable in real-world applications, underscoring the critical need to concurrently address multiple types of fairness. However, Gupta et al. [71] found that approximately half of the existing work on fairness in LLMs focuses solely on gender bias. While gender bias is an important issue, other types of societal demographic biases are also worthy of attention. Expanding the scope of research to encompass a broader range of bias categories can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of bias.

Develop More and Tailored Datasets. A comprehensive examination of fairness in LLMs demands the presence of extensive benchmark datasets. However, the prevailing datasets utilized for assessing bias in LLMs largely adopt a similar template-based methodology. Examples of such datasets, such as WinoBias [239], Winogender [239], GAP [198], and BUG [99], consist of sentences featuring blank slots, which language models are tasked with completing. Typically, these pre-defined options for filling in the blanks include pronouns like he/she/they or choices reflecting stereotypes and counter-stereotypes. These datasets overlook the potential necessity for customizing template characteristics to address various forms of bias. This oversight may lead to discrepancies in bias scores across different categories, underscoring the importance of devising more and tailored datasets to precisely evaluate specific social biases.

## 9 CONCLUSION

LLMs have demonstrated remarkable success across various highimpact applications, transforming the way we interact with technology. However, without proper fairness safeguards, they risk making decisions that could lead to discrimination, presenting a serious ethical issues and an increasing societal concern. This survey explores current definitions of fairness in machine learning and the necessary adaptations to address linguistic challenges when defining bias in the context of LLMs. Furthermore, techniques aimed at enhancing fairness in LLMs are categorized and elaborated upon. Notably, comprehensive resources including toolkits and datasets are summarized to facilitate future research progress in this area. Finally, existing challenges and open questions areas are also discussed.

#### Abstract

The rapid advancements in pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) ${ }^{1}$ have ushered in a new era of intelligent applications, transforming fields ranging from natural language processing to content generation. The LLM supply chain represents a crucial aspect of the contemporary artificial intelligence landscape. It encompasses the entire lifecycle of pre-trained models, from its initial development and training to its final deployment and application in various domains. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the LLM supply chain, highlighting its three core elements: 1) the model infrastructure, encompassing datasets and toolchain for training, optimization, and deployment; 2) the model lifecycle, covering training, testing, releasing, and ongoing maintenance; and 3) the downstream application ecosystem, enabling the integration of pre-trained models into a wide range of intelligent applications. However, this rapidly evolving field faces numerous challenges across these key components, including data privacy and security, model interpretability and fairness, infrastructure scalability, and regulatory compliance. Addressing these challenges is essential for harnessing the full potential of LLMs and ensuring their ethical and responsible use. This paper provides a future research agenda for the LLM supply chain, aiming at driving the continued advancement and responsible deployment of these transformative LLMs.


## 1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid advancement of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as GPT4 [2], Gemini [183], and LLaMA [187], has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and sparked a new era of intelligent applications. These powerful models, trained on vast amounts of data, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, from natural language processing to multimodal content generation.

As the adoption of LLM continues to grow, the need for a robust and efficient supply chain to support their development, deployment, and maintenance has become increasingly apparent. The LLM supply chain encompasses the entire lifecycle, from model training to testing, releasing, and ongoing maintenance. This complex ecosystem involves various stakeholders, including model[^0]

developers, data providers, and end-users, all of whom must navigate a set of unique challenges to unlock the full potential of these transformative technologies.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the LLM supply chain, highlighting the key components and the critical challenges that must be addressed to ensure the safe, reliable, and equitable deployment of LLMs. We explore the technical, ethical, and operational aspects of this supply chain, drawing insights from the fields of software engineering, system architecture, security, and data governance. Our goal is to provide a holistic understanding of the LLM supply chain and to identify the most promising research and development opportunities that can drive the future of this rapidly evolving landscape.

## 2 DEFINITION OF LLM SUPPLY CHAIN

Similar to the Open Source Software (OSS) supply chain [93, 164, 204], the LLM supply chain refers to the network of relationships that encompass the development, distribution, and deployment of models. This supply chain includes the upstream model development communities, model repositories, distribution platforms, and app markets, as well as data providers, toolchain/model developers, maintainers, and end-users. As illustrated in Figure 1, this supply chain can be further divided into three key components:

- Fundamental Infrastructure: The LLM supply chain is underpinned by a robust model infrastructure, which includes the curation and management of diverse datasets, and the toolchain that enables efficient model training, optimization, and deployment (such as PyTorch [158], TensorFlow [184] and LangChain [94]);
- Model Lifecycle: The model lifecycle stands as the pivotal nexus within the intricate LLM supply chain ecosystem. This holistic lifecycle, spanning a model's entire process from conception to retirement, serves as the convergence point for the complex interdependencies permeating the supply chain. It not only encompasses the dependencies introduced by model reuse but also intricately intertwines with the dataset and development tools supply chain in the infrastructure layer;
- Downstream Application Ecosystem: Atop the model infrastructure and lifecycle, the LLM supply chain encompasses a vibrant downstream application ecosystem. This ecosystem includes applications and services powered by LLMs, such as GPTs [144], as well as Domain-Specific Models (DSMs), which directly bring the capabilities of these transformative technologies to end-users.

Figure 1: Definition and Each Component of LLM Supply Chain.

These complex interdependencies and interactions between these components form the backbone of the LLM supply chain. By defining the LLM supply chain in this manner, we can draw insights from the existing research on OSS supply chain and apply them to the unique requirements and complexities of the LLM ecosystem. This holistic understanding will serve as a foundation for the subsequent exploration of the opportunities and challenges within the LLM supply chain.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We delve into discussions on model infrastructure, model lifecycle, and the downstream application ecosystem in $\S 3$, § 4, and § 5, respectively. Each section is structured in the order of vision, challenge, and opportunity. Finally, we conclude the paper in $\S 6$.

## 3 LLM INFRASTRUCTURE

The model infrastructure is a foundational component of the LLM supply chain, encompassing the dataset and toolchain necessary for the training, testing, deployment, and maintenance of LLMs.

### 3.1 Vision: High-quality Dataset

In the evolving landscape of LLMs, the vision for a high-quality dataset within the supply chain embodies a multifaceted commitment to excellence, privacy, and ethical standards [136]. At the heart of this vision lies the recognition that the quality and integrity of datasets are not merely ancillary concerns but are central to the development of models that are both effective and responsible [74, 163]. This vision articulates a future where datasets are meticulously curated to ensure accuracy, relevance, and comprehensive representation of real-world complexities. To achieve this vision, several challenges must be addressed:

Challenge I: Data Cleaning and Curation. The process of data cleaning and curation is a critical step in the development of LLMs, serving as the backbone for ensuring integrity, privacy, and ethical alignment. This step, however, is laden with significant challenges that can compromise the efficacy and safety of LLMs if not addressed with rigor and foresight. The primary obstacles stem from the handling of redundant [83], privacy [22, 23, 88, 126], biased [48, 89, 141, 221, 233], and toxic [148, 199, 233] data in training sets, each of which presents unique challenge. Redundancy in training datasets not only inflates the size of the dataset unnecessarily but also skews the model's learning, leading to efficiency issues [25, 96, 185] and potential overfitting to repetitive data patterns [68, 83, 229]. The potential privacy challenges are twofold: ensuring that personally identifiable information (PII) is not present in the training data [19] and preventing the model from learning to reproduce or infer it from the patterns it is trained on [22,23, 88]. Bias in training data is a well-documented issue that can lead models to perpetuate or even amplify existing prejudices $[16,114,176]$. The challenge lies in identifying and mitigating biases, which are often deeply embedded in the data and reflective of broader societal biases [52,176]. The presence of toxic and harmful content in training datasets poses a significant risk to the safety and reliability of LLMs [15, 148, 199, 233]. Models trained on datasets containing such content may reproduce or even generate harmful outputs, undermining their applicability in diverse contexts. These challenges in data cleaning and curation require sophisticated strategies for mitigation, and this provides some opportunities as discussed below.

- Opportunity: Deduplication. At the forefront of this opportunity is the development of more sophisticated deduplication algorithms. Simple deduplication methods such as MinHash [17] often struggle with the scale and diversity of data typical for LLM training [27]. Advanced deduplication strategies that carefully evaluate which duplicates to remove can ensure that the richness of the data is maintained. There lies a potential in leveraging careful data selection via pre-trained model embeddings, ensuring that training data are both diverse and concise. Innovations in this area could significantly reduce computational overhead and improve model performance.
- Opportunity: Privacy Preserving. The development and implementation of innovative privacy preserving algorithms stand out as a primary opportunity. Current methods such as k-anonymity [179], l-diversity [130], t-closeness [105] and differential privacy $[41,43,155,169,170]$ have set the foundation, yet they often face challenges in balancing privacy with data utility. The need to preserve privacy while ensuring that the dataset remains comprehensive and informative enough to train robust models is still an open problem.
- Opportunity: Bias Mitigation. The first opportunity lies in enhancing methodologies for the detection and correction of biases in datasets. While significant progress has been made [120, 141, 152], there is a continuous need for more sophisticated tools that can identify subtle and complex biases. Another critical opportunity is to strike a balance between removing biases and maintaining the representativeness of datasets. This involves not only the removal of harmful biases but also ensuring that the diversity and richness of human experiences are accurately reflected in LLMs.
- Opportunity: Detoxifying. Cleaning datasets of toxic content requires not only sophisticated detection tools [11, 92, 225] but also a nuanced understanding of the mechanism what constitutes harm $[7,153,200]$, which can vary widely across different cultural and social contexts. Cross-cultural sensitivity presents an opportunity to create guidelines and frameworks that respect cultural differences while identifying universally harmful content.

Challenge II: Avoid Data Poisoning. Data poisoning attacks [150, $165,223]$ pose severe supply chain risks for LLMs, as attackers can degrade model performance or introduce backdoors [1, 108, 111, 212] through corrupted training data, which undermines the integrity and reliability of LLMs. Additionally, supply chain attacks targeting the data storage, processing, or distribution infrastructure can facilitate data poisoning or corruption, potentially compromising the entire model development lifecycle. Avoiding data poisoning in the supply chain of LLMs presents a multifaceted set of challenges, intricately linked with the broader objectives of data cleaning and curation. Crucial opportunities include enhancing data validation, improving provenance tracking, and implementing comprehensive security measures throughout the entire data lifecycle.

- Opportunity: Robust Data Validation. The first line of defense against data poisoning is robust data validation [72, 156], a process that is inherently complex due to the vast scale and heterogeneity of datasets used in LLM training. Effective validation requires sophisticated algorithms capable of detecting anomalies and malicious modifications in the data [127], which is a task that becomes exponentially difficult as the data volume and diversity increase [151, 171]. The opportunity for progress in robust data validation resides in advancing algorithmic solutions that are capable of nuanced detection of subtle and sophisticated data manipulation attempts. These solutions must be scalable enough to manage the expansive datasets characteristic of LLM training, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage without compromising efficiency.
- Opportunity: Provenance Tracking. Provenance tracking, or the ability to trace the origin and history of each data point, becomes paramount in a landscape where data can be compromised at any stage $[72,162,181,210]$. Implementing such tracking mechanisms involves not only technical solutions [140] but also organizational policies that ensure data sources are reputable and that data handling practices are transparent [49] and secure. However, establishing a provenance tracking system that is both comprehensive and efficient remains an open problem, given the complexity of LLM supply chains and the potential for data to be aggregated from myriad sources [125, 197, 227].
- Opportunity: Securing Data Lifecycle. Ensuring rigorous security measures across the entire data lifecycle is critical to safeguarding against poisoning attacks $[6,166]$. This encompasses not only the protection of data at rest and in transit but also the security of the infrastructure used for data processing and model training [163]. As supply chain attacks can target any component of the system, a holistic security approach that includes regular audits, encryption, access control, and real-time monitoring is essential for identifying and mitigating threats promptly $[6,72]$.

Challenge III: License Management. License management encompasses a range of challenges that are critical to navigate in order to maintain legal and ethical standards. As LLMs require vast amounts of diverse data for training, the risk of copyright infringement, licensing violations, and subsequent legal liabilities intensifies [29, 84, 85, 100]. Recent research [125, 178, 192, 202, 204] has shed light on the complex landscape of dataset copyright and licensing, underscoring the need for further exploration and development of best practices. This need is further complicated by the diversity of data sources and the often opaque legal frameworks governing data use [49]. These challenges also open up some opportunities for further research.

- Opportunity: Complex License Understanding. One of the primary challenges in license management is the complexity and variety of licenses [37, 192-194, 196]. Data sources can range from publicly available datasets with open licenses to proprietary datasets with strict usage restrictions. Each source may come with its own set of legal terms, requiring careful review and understanding to ensure compliance $[9,55,195,202$, 207]. Opportunities in this area could include the automated detection and summarization of key legal terms, providing stakeholders with clear, accessible insights into the permissions, obligations, and restrictions associated with each dataset.
- Opportunity: License Conflict Auditing. Automated license conflict auditing represents another significant opportunity to enhance license management practices [3, 121, 188]. Such systems could potentially streamline the process of verifying compliance with licensing agreements across vast datasets. However, developing these systems faces technical hurdles, including the need for advanced algorithms capable of interpreting and applying the legal nuances of different licenses [190]. Moreover, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of these automated systems is paramount to avoid unintentional violations.


### 3.2 Vision: Robust \& Secure Toolchain

In the realm of LLMs, the development tools and frameworks serve as the cornerstone of innovation, significantly shaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence. This vision, from both a software engineering (SE) and security standpoint, is ambitious yet grounded, aiming to forge a development environment that is robust, scalable, and inherently secure. By weaving together the best practices of SE with advanced security measures, this approach ensures that the toolchain not only enable the crafting of sophisticated models but also safeguard the integrity of the entire supply chain.

From a SE perspective, central to this vision is the seamless incorporation of SE best practices into LLM development tools and frameworks. Modular design principles are prioritized to boost maintainability and scalability, allowing for seamless updates and modifications without impacting the broader system. The vision also encompasses the implementation of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline the testing and deployment processes, enhancing development speed.

From a Security perspective, a "security by design" philosophy is advocated, embedding security considerations at the onset of the development process. This includes deploying comprehensive code analysis tools for early vulnerability detection and enforcing secure authentication. Beyond individual security practices, a crucial aspect of safeguarding the LLM supply chain involves addressing the security of the development tools' own supply chains. Given the reliance of most LLM systems on a handful of core frameworks, the compromise of any one of these foundational elements could expose a vast array of LLM systems to risk [121, 142, 160]. To mitigate these risks, the vision calls for rigorous security measures at every level of the supply chain for development tools and frameworks. Such measures are essential for preventing the introduction of vulnerabilities into LLM systems through compromised software components or malicious third-party contributions.

Challenge: Dependency and Vulnerability Management. Managing the intricate web of dependencies, including both open-source and commercial components, poses a significant challenge within the supply chain $[67,116,129]$. Supply chain attacks targeting the development infrastructure or code repositories could lead to the injection of vulnerabilities or malicious code [42, 62, 106], potentially compromising the entire lifecycle of model development and deployment. Moreover, vulnerabilities within dependencies or components can propagate through the supply chain [69, 226], adversely affecting the security and reliability of models. Establishing robust dependency management processes, conducting thorough security monitoring, and ensuring supply chain transparency are essential for mitigating risks such as compromises in the LLM development tools supply chain.

- Opportunity: LLM Toolchain Mining. A promising avenue for enhancing supply chain security lies in the opportunity of LLM development toolchain mining. This approach involves the systematic analysis and evaluation [80] of the tools and libraries used in the creation and training of LLMs. The core of this opportunity revolves around the comprehensive mining and auditing of development tools, from code libraries to data processing frameworks used in LLM training. Through the detailed analysis of the toolchain, developers can identify redundancies, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, paving the way for the development of more streamlined, effective, and secure LLMs. Additionally, this mining process can spur innovation by highlighting gaps or needs within the toolchain, driving the creation of new tools, or the enhancement of existing ones to better serve the evolving demands of LLM development.
- Opportunity: SBOM of LLM Toolchain. The adoption of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) of LLM toolchain presents a unique opportunity to achieve unprecedented levels of transparency and security. By meticulously documenting every library, dependency, and third-party component, SBOM enables developers to gain a comprehensive overview of their tools' software ecosystem [174, 175, 208]. This holistic visibility is instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities, outdated components, and non-compliant software elements that could jeopardize the development process and, ultimately, the security of the LLMs themselves. The detailed insights provided by SBOMs pave the way for proactive vulnerability management. Armed with knowledge about every constituent component, development teams can swiftly address security flaws, apply necessary patches, and update components. This preemptive identification and remediation process is crucial in safeguarding the models against potential exploits that could jeopardize their reliability and the security of the systems they operate within.


## 4 LLM LIFECYCLE

In the evolving landscape of LLMs, the vision for the model lifecycle within the supply chain encompasses a holistic and agile approach, from initial development to deployment, maintenance, and updates. This lifecycle is envisioned to be a seamless continuum that not only addresses the inherent challenges but also leverages them as catalysts for innovation and progression in the field.

### 4.1 Vision: Efficient Development \& Training

The vision for developing and training LLMs is a compelling narrative of innovation, inclusivity, and ethical responsibility, aiming to push the boundaries of what these computational behemoths can achieve while grounding their evolution in principles that benefit all of humanity. This vision integrates the cutting edge of technological innovation with an unwavering commitment to ethical principles and operational efficiency. Firstly, the training of LLMs is envisioned to become increasingly efficient and environmentally sustainable. As the computational demands of these models soar, innovative approaches to training such as more efficient algorithms and hardware optimization are prioritized. Another cornerstone of this vision is the seamless integration of ethical considerations and bias mitigation strategies from the outset. This approach ensures that LLMs are developed with a deep understanding of their potential societal impacts, embedding ethical guidelines into the DNA of model development and ensuring that LLMs do not become tools for misinformation, manipulation, or harm.

Challenge: Inner Alignment. As the capabilities of LLMs continue to expand, the necessity of ensuring their alignment [123, 167, 201] with human values and intentions becomes increasingly critical. The concept of inner alignment [71, 167] focuses on ensuring that an LLM's objectives are congruent with the intentions of its
designers during the development and training phase. The pursuit of inner alignment during the development and training phase of LLMs requires a multifaceted strategy. However, inner alignment is complicated by its nuanced failure modes [5, 71, 167], such as proxy, approximate, and suboptimality alignments, each presenting unique challenges in ensuring LLM systems operate as intended. These failure modes underscore the potential divergence between a model's optimized objectives and the overarching goals its designers aim to achieve. To address these issues, methodological approaches such as relaxed adversarial training [71] and partitioning gradients [218] have been proposed. However, the efficacy of such methodologies hinges on the transparency of the LLM system's decision-making processes, which provides opportunities for further research.

- Opportunity: Advancing Interpretability of LLMs. Firstly, the opportunity to advance the methodology of transparency and interpretability in LLMs stands as a critical endeavor [173]. Enhancing transparency involves shedding light on the often opaque decision-making processes of these models, enabling a clearer understanding of how inputs are processed and interpreted to produce outputs. By demystifying the inner workings of LLMs, researchers, and practitioners can gain valuable insights into the operational dynamics of these models, identifying areas where the models' behaviors may not align with expected or desired outcomes $[81,173]$. When developers and users can understand how a model is processing information and arriving at conclusions, they can more effectively detect when the model deviates from the intended behavior. This early detection is invaluable, as it allows for timely interventions to correct course [103, 180], preventing minor misalignments from escalating into more significant issues.
- Opportunity: Enhancing Feedback Mechanisms. The integration of robust feedback mechanisms into LLMs represents a transformative opportunity to enhance their adaptability and alignment with human values over time [131, 154]. By embedding iterative feedback loops within the architecture of LLMs, developers can establish a dynamic process where the models continually learn and adjust from real-world interactions and user feedback. Feedback loops can be particularly beneficial in identifying and correcting biases, misconceptions, or inaccuracies that may emerge in LLM outputs, thereby enhancing the models' trustworthiness and reliability [117, 149, 154]. This process enables LLMs to evolve and adapt in response to changing contexts, user needs, and societal norms, ensuring their ongoing relevance and utility.


### 4.2 Vision: Holistic Testing \& Evaluation

In the complex supply chain of LLMs, the testing and evaluation phase is pivotal, serving as the final arbiter of a model's readiness for deployment and its potential impact on users and society at large. The vision for this phase is one of comprehensive rigor, transparency, and adaptability, ensuring that LLMs are not only technologically proficient but also ethically sound and socially beneficial. Specifically, the vision for the testing and evaluation of LLMs is deeply rooted in ensuring these advanced tools are helpful, honest, and harmless [10, 149], aligning with the broader goals of ethical integrity and societal benefit. By rigorously assessing LLMs against these principles, we can foster the development of technologies that are not only revolutionary in their capabilities but also responsible in their deployment. However, realizing such a vision faces the following major challenges:

Challenge I: Helpfulness Testing. Evaluating the helpfulness of LLMs is a critical aspect of ensuring their practical utility and widespread adoption. To this end, researchers have been developing benchmark datasets and tasks that measure LLM performance on capabilities such as question answering [13, 177, 231], task completion [38, 44, 61, 107, 189], and knowledge retrieval [59, 82, 168] across diverse domains. These benchmarks not only test for general knowledge [59, 82, 168] but also probe domain-specific expertise [61, 177, 189], allowing for a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to provide useful and relevant outputs. However, there are still several formidable challenges which highlight not only the complexity inherent in measuring the utility of such models but also underscore the necessity for ongoing refinement in our approaches to evaluation.

- Opportunity: Developing Comprehensive Metrics and Benchmarks. First and foremost, the opportunity to develop more comprehensive metrics and benchmarks provides a pathway to better understand the performance of LLMs [119, 137, 219]. Traditional benchmarks, while useful, often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of tasks LLMs are expected to perform, especially in areas like code generation $[40,119,219]$. The current benchmarks, such as HumanEval [26] and AiXBench [64], provide a starting point but do not sufficiently address the complexities of generating code at the repository or project level $[40,119,219]$. This limitation points to a need for benchmarks that can assess an LLM's ability to understand projectspecific contexts, manage dependencies across multiple files, and ensure consistency within a larger codebase. Developing such metrics requires a deep understanding of the practical tasks users expect LLMs to perform and a thoughtful consideration of how to measure success in those tasks.
- Opportunity: Avoiding Data Contamination. Additionally, the issue of data contamination [35, 134] significantly complicates the evaluation of LLMs. Data contamination occurs when a model is inadvertently exposed to information from the test set during training, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not accurately represent the model's true capabilities [99, 157]. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like code generation $[21,39]$, where the vast amount of publicly available code means that models might "learn" specific solutions during training that they later reproduce during testing. Such instances of data contamination not only overestimate the model's performance but also obscure our understanding of its ability to generate innovative solutions to new problems. Although there have been efforts to quantify and detect data contamination [56, 57, 109, 110], effectively addressing this issue remains a challenge $[8,21,34,146]$. Opportunities in identifying and mitigating the impact of data contamination include the development of novel evaluation frameworks that can detect when a model is reproducing rather than generating solutions [56, 57, 109], and the development of testing
metrics and benchmarks specifically designed to prevent data contamination $[39,75,110]$.

Challenge II: Honesty Testing. As LLMs become increasingly influential in various domains, ensuring their honesty and truthfulness is paramount to building trust and preventing the spread of misinformation. Honesty testing [97, 101, 113, 115, 138, 231] for LLMs involves assessing whether the models can consistently provide information that is not only factually correct but also free from deception or misleading implications. These tests aim to identify instances of hallucinated [77, 228] or fabricated information $[97,115,138]$ in LLM outputs, which can undermine their trustworthiness. Assessing the consistency and coherence of LLM outputs across multiple queries and prompts can reveal potential inconsistencies or contradictions, which may indicate a lack of factual grounding or honesty.

- Opportunity: Hallucination Mitigation. Hallucination mitigation in LLMs is an area of significant concern, with various innovative techniques employed to address the issue [60, 186]. These methods range from retrieval augmented generation $[53,154,191]$ to self-refinement through feedback and reasoning $[78,172]$, each targeting different aspects of hallucination to ensure the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs. However, there's an open problem in balancing mitigation efforts with the preservation of LLMs' generative capabilities, avoiding over-restriction that could stifle their performance. The development of LLMs with inherent mechanisms to prevent hallucinations is an exciting avenue, potentially leading to inherently more honest models.

Challenge III: Harmlessness Testing. The challenge of harmlessness testing in LLMs is multifaceted, rooted in the need to detect and mitigate a broad spectrum of potential harms. Researchers have been developing benchmarks $[32,54,70,76,139]$ that probe LLMs for the presence of harmful biases, stereotypes, or discriminatory language across various sensitive topics and demographic groups. Furthermore, testing LLMs for potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks [159, 198, 230], jailbreaks [28, 36, 122, 232], or misuse [12, 51, 66, 133, 214, 224] by attackers ensures their outputs do not enable harmful actions or security breaches. Yet they are beset with the inherent challenge of predicting and counteracting the myriad ways in which these sophisticated models might be exploited or go awry.

- Opportunity: Detection and Mitigation. Despite these challenges, the domain of harmlessness testing for LLMs presents substantial opportunities to enhance the safety and integrity of LLMs. Developing advanced benchmarks and testing protocols offers a pathway to not only detect but also rectify harmful outputs before they reach end-users, thereby safeguarding public trust in LLM applications. This endeavor encourages the creation of more nuanced and context-aware models, capable of discerning and adapting to the ethical implications of their outputs. Additionally, addressing the risks of adversarial misuse opens avenues for innovative defensive strategies, fortifying LLMs against manipulation and ensuring their outputs remain aligned with ethical standards.


### 4.3 Vision: Collaborative Release \& Sharing

The release and sharing phase represents a pivotal point in the LLM lifecycle, where trained models are packaged for distribution, complete with serialization and documentation detailing their capabilities, limitations, and intended applications. These models are then published to repositories or model hubs like Hugging Face [45], making them accessible for reuse by others through techniques such as feature extraction, fine-tuning, transfer learning, and knowledge distillation [33, 79, 182]. Providing licensing information and metadata is crucial for facilitating responsible adoption and collaboration. However, akin to traditional software supply chains, the reuse of pre-trained models introduces significant supply chain risks that must be carefully managed. The propagation of dependency risks, such as privacy concerns [1, 213], biases [19, 48, 73], hallucinations [118, 228], and vulnerabilities [1], can occur throughout the supply chain during model reuse and adaptation processes. Ensuring the trustworthy and responsible use of these powerful models necessitates comprehensive supply chain risk management strategies to mitigate potential threats and foster transparency, compliance, and accountability.

Challenge I: Model Dependency Analysis. Comprehensive analysis of model dependencies is a crucial first step in mitigating LLM supply chain risks. Existing approaches [91, 112] to dependency analysis include (1) version information analysis; (2) training-code analysis; (3) model file analysis; (4) watermarking and fingerprinting. Analyzing version control systems and model management tools helps track dependencies in model ecosystems, but often fails to fully capture complex interdependencies. Examining the training codebase for dependencies on libraries or datasets is detailed but might not reflect the deployed model accurately. Analyzing binary model files can offer precise insights into model architecture and behavior but is resource-heavy and challenging with encrypted formats. Embedding watermarks in models aids in tracking and provenance but is less effective for third-party models and can impact performance. These methods highlight the intricate challenges of understanding dependencies in LLMs.

- Opportunity: Model Reuse Tracking. Addressing the challenges of dependency tracking in LLMs presents several opportunities for advancing the field. Enhanced algorithms for analyzing version control and model management systems could provide deeper insights into the nuanced interdependencies within model ecosystems. Developing more efficient methods for codebase analysis could reduce computational overhead while offering accurate reflections of model dependencies. Improving techniques for binary model file analysis represents a significant opportunity, which could lead to methods that can effectively navigate obfuscated or encrypted formats, providing a clearer understanding of a model's architecture and behavior. Potential research directions include developing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of these existing techniques, leveraging advanced code analysis, binary analysis, and machine learning-based methods to enhance dependency detection accuracy and scalability.

Challenge II: Risk Propagation Mitigation. Analyzing the propagation of vulnerabilities in the LLM supply chain introduces considerable challenges. The intricate nature of these models, with
their deep layers and complex dependencies, makes it challenging to track how risks like privacy breaches, bias, hallucination issues, and potential backdoors can permeate through the supply chain. Identifying these risks requires a thorough understanding of the interconnections and the flow of data and configurations across different model components. The absence of standardized methods for documenting these elements further complicates the task, making it difficult to conduct a comprehensive and effective risk assessment and to pinpoint areas where vulnerabilities might be introduced or propagated.

- Opportunity: Developing Model Bill of Materials (MBOM). There lies a significant opportunity to enhance the security and integrity of LLMs through the development of standardized practices for generating and maintaining a Model Bill of Materials (MBOM) for pre-trained models, mirroring the concept of SBOM. Such standardization would improve supply chain transparency, enabling stakeholders to more effectively identify, assess, and mitigate risks. Moreover, fostering collaboration among researchers, industry practitioners, and regulatory bodies can lead to the establishment of robust best practices and guidelines for the responsible release and sharing of models. This collaborative approach would not only enhance the trustworthiness and accountability of LLMs across the supply chain but also ensure that risk mitigation strategies are holistic, timely, and aligned with evolving ethical and security standards, ultimately leading to a safer and more reliable LLM ecosystem.


### 4.4 Vision: Continuous Deploy \& Maintenance

In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, pre-trained models must adapt to changing real-world conditions, emerging data distributions, and novel task requirements to maintain their utility and relevance. The model maintenance and update phase is crucial for ensuring the longevity and continued effectiveness of these powerful models. However, this phase presents several opportunities and challenges that demand rigorous exploration by the research community.

Challenge I: Model Drift. The challenge of identifying and quantifying model drift in LLMs is considerable [30, 102, 132, 147]. LLMs are trained on vast datasets that are supposed to represent the linguistic diversity of their intended application domain. However, as the language evolves or the model is applied to slightly different contexts, the ability to remain relevant and consistent can shift in subtle ways. Recent research [18, 30, 132] emphasizes the need for sophisticated tools that can detect not only overt drifts in language usage but also more nuanced shifts in sentiment, context, or cultural references. These tools must be capable of parsing the complexities of human language, requiring ongoing refinement and adaptation to new linguistic phenomena.

- Opportunity: Model Drift Monitoring. The realm of drift monitoring in LLMs presents a fertile ground for innovation and development. There is a significant opportunity to create and refine tools that can accurately detect and measure drift in various dimensions, from language usage to sentiment and contextual nuances. Furthermore, integrating these drift monitoring tools into the model development and deployment lifecycle can provide ongoing insights into model performance [30, 132], enabling timely adjustments and enhancements. This proactive approach to managing model drift not only ensures the sustained relevance and accuracy of LLMs but also opens new avenues for research in understanding and mitigating the subtleties of language evolution in artificial intelligence.

Challenge II: Continual Learning. Once drift is detected, the next challenge is adapting the model to accommodate this change. A promising aspect of this phase is continual learning [14, 86, 206], the model's ability to learn from new data over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A primary challenge in continual learning is catastrophic forgetting [63, 98], where the model loses its ability to perform tasks it was previously trained on after learning new information. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for LLMs due to their complex architecture and the vast scope of their training data. Recent advancements in research have proposed various strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, such as rehearsal-based methods [4, 20, 65, 161] and regularization-based methods [90, 143, 222]. The foundational concept of rehearsal-based methods is Experience Replay (ER) [161], which involves storing samples from past tasks and reusing them when learning new tasks. This approach simulates the ongoing presence of old data alongside new data, thereby reducing the tendency of the model to forget previously learned information. The core idea behind regularization-based methods is to protect the knowledge acquired from previous tasks by preventing significant updates to the model parameters that are deemed important for those tasks [90]. Despite their conceptual appeal, regularizationbased methods face challenges in practice. They can struggle with long sequences of tasks, as the accumulation of regularization terms may eventually lead to a situation where the model becomes too rigid, hindering its ability to learn new information [24, 47, 98].

- Opportunity: Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation. The field of mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs is ripe with opportunities, particularly in enhancing and refining the existing strategies. The potential for innovation in rehearsal-based methods extends beyond mere data retention. Advanced data selection algorithms could be developed to identify and store the most representative or crucial samples, thus improving the efficiency of the rehearsal process. In the realm of regularizationbased methods, opportunities abound for creating more dynamic and adaptable regularization techniques. Furthermore, integrating these strategies or exploring hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of rehearsal and regularization could offer new pathways to robust continual learning. By developing methods that dynamically switch or combine strategies based on the task context or learning phase, models could achieve greater flexibility and effectiveness in retaining old knowledge while acquiring new information.


## 5 DOWNSTREAM ECOSYSTEM

The downstream application ecosystem serves as the final stage in the LLM supply chain, embodying the point where the efforts invested in developing, training, and refining these models are translated into practical benefits across different fields. This ecosystem is characterized by a diverse array of applications and services
that leverage pre-trained models to address real-world challenges, driving innovation and efficiency.

### 5.1 Vision: Revolutionary LLM App Store

The concept of an LLM app store (such as GPT Store [145]) represents a transformative vision for the downstream ecosystem of the LLM supply chain. It envisions a centralized platform where developers can publish applications powered by LLMs, and users can discover and access these applications to fulfill a wide array of tasks and objectives. Drawing inspiration from the success of mobile app store [50, 95, 135], the LLM app store aims to replicate this success within the domain by offering a curated, secure, and user-friendly environment for LLM-driven applications. At the core of the LLM app store's vision is the desire to catalyze innovation by lowering the barriers to entry for developers and providing them with a platform to build and deploy LLM-powered applications.

Challenge \& Opportunity: App Store Governance. Creating an LLM app store introduces several challenges, primarily concerning the quality control, compatibility, and ethical considerations of the models hosted. Ensuring that each LLM adheres to a high standard of accuracy, fairness, and security is crucial to maintaining user trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Additionally, the diversity of LLMs in terms of size, functionality, and intended use cases necessitates robust mechanisms for assessing and certifying model compatibility with various platforms and user requirements. Ethical concerns also come to the forefront, as the store must have stringent policies to prevent the dissemination of models that could be used maliciously or propagate bias, misinformation, or harmful content. However, an LLM app store also presents vast opportunities for innovation and value creation. By implementing mechanisms for user engagement, such as ratings and reviews, the store can facilitate a feedback loop that drives the evolution of more sophisticated and user-aligned LLMs, promoting a culture of transparency and accountability within the LLM community.

### 5.2 Vision: Ubiquitous On-device LLMs

The vision for on-device LLM deployment is to bring the power of advanced natural language understanding and generation directly to user devices [104, 124, 217], such as smartphones, tablets, and edge devices. This approach aims to significantly reduce reliance on cloud-based services, enabling faster response times, enhanced privacy, and reduced data transmission costs [216]. By running LLMs locally, users can benefit from real-time, personalized LLM experiences even in offline or low-bandwidth environments, unlocking new possibilities for LLM integration across various industries. Challenge \& Opportunity: Model Compression. The primary challenge in realizing on-device LLMs lies in model compression. Current state-of-the-art LLMs are often massive, requiring substantial computational resources that exceed the capacity of typical consumer devices [217]. Compressing these models without significant loss of effectiveness involves sophisticated techniques such as pruning [128, 211], quantization [87, 209, 215], and knowledge distillation [46, 203]. Each method must be carefully applied to balance the trade-offs between model size, speed, and performance. Additionally, the diverse hardware landscape of user devices presents further challenges in optimizing models for a wide array of processing capabilities, memory sizes, and power constraints. Despite these challenges, model compression presents immense opportunities. Innovations in this space can lead to more accessible and ubiquitous LLM, where powerful language models can operate seamlessly on a broad spectrum of devices. This democratization of LLM can spur a new wave of applications and services that are intelligent, context-aware, and personalized.

### 5.3 Vision: Expert Domain-specific LLMs

The vision for domain-specific LLMs is to create highly specialized models that offer expert-level understanding and generation capabilities within specific fields or industries. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these models are fine-tuned with domain-specific data, enabling them to offer deeper insights, more accurate predictions, and nuanced understanding tailored to particular professional contexts, such as healthcare [220], law [31], finance [205], or scientific research [58]. This specialization aims to unlock transformative applications in various sectors, providing tools that can augment human expertise, automate complex tasks, and facilitate decisionmaking processes with unprecedented precision and reliability.

Challenge \& Opportunity: Specialized Dataset Collection. The primary challenge in developing domain-specific LLMs lies in gathering high-quality, specialized datasets to train these models. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, domain-specific models require data that encapsulates the depth and breadth of knowledge unique to each field, often necessitating collaboration with domain experts and significant investment in data acquisition and preparation. On the flip side, the opportunities presented by successfully developing domain-specific LLMs are immense and hold the potential to be truly transformative. By overcoming the challenges of data curation and model training, these LLMs can provide unparalleled support in decision-making and operational tasks within specialized fields. In essence, the successful deployment of domain-specific LLMs could introduce new paradigms of efficiency, accuracy, and insight across a myriad of specialized fields, marking a significant leap forward in how industries leverage LLMs.

## 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of the LLM supply chain, delving into the intricate phases of model infrastructure, lifecycle, and the downstream application ecosystem. We identified critical challenges at each stage, underscoring the opportunities for future research. In the realm of infrastructure, we highlighted the paramount importance of high-quality datasets and a robust and secure toolchain. The lifecycle of LLMs, marked by phases of development, testing, release, and maintenance, revealed the need for continuous innovation and vigilance to ensure models remain effective, secure, and aligned with ethical standards. The exploration of the downstream application ecosystem, which includes LLM app markets, on-device LLMs, and DSMs, opened a window into the future potential of LLMs across various industries and applications. In conclusion, we believe that the LLM supply chain represents a vibrant and complex ecosystem, and hope that this paper will provide an agenda for future research.
