#### Abstract

Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain. We propose the CHAIN-OF-TABLE framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions. CHAINOF-TABLE achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.


## 1 INTRODUCTION

Tables are a popular data format and widely used in daily life (Cafarella et al., 2008). Understanding tabular data with language models can benefit various downstream tasks, such as table-based fact verification (Chen et al., 2019), and table-based question answering (Jin et al., 2022). Distinct from pure text, tables deliver rich information through the interaction between rows and columns in the tabular structure, which enhances the data capacity but also increases the difficulty for language models to understand them. Thus, reasoning over the tabular data is an important direction in natural language processing and attracts increasing attention from both academia and industry.

In recent years, several approaches have been suggested to tackle the problem of table understanding by training language models. One common direction is to add specialized embedding layers or attention mechanisms into language models and pre-train the models by recovering table cells or segments (Herzig et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2022; Andrejczuk et al., 2022). In this way, the pre-trained models are aware of the tabular structure. Another direction is to synthesize SQL query-response pairs and pre-train an encoder-decoder model as a neural SQL executor (Eisenschlos et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022).

Recently, large language models (LLMs) achieve outstanding performance across diverse tasks solely by prompting, thanks to the massive scale of pre-training (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022). As series of works on prompting techniques have further improved the reliability of LLMs by designing reasoning chains, such as Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), Least-to-Most (Zhou et al., 2022), Program-of-Thought (Chen et al., 2022) and Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023). Different works have also explored the possibility of using LLMs to solve table-based problems (Chen,[^0]

Figure 1: Illustration of the comparison between (a) generic reasoning, (b) program-aided reasoning, and (c) the proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE. Given a complex table where a cyclist's nationality and name are in the same cell, (a) is unable to provide the correct answer through multi-step reasoning due to the complexity; (b) generates and executes programs (e.g. SQL queries) to deliver the answer, but it also falls short in accurately parsing the name and nationality in the table. In contrast, (c) CHAIN-OF-TABLE iteratively samples a chain of operations that effectively transform the complex table into a version specifically tailored to the question. With the assistance of CHAINOF-TABLE, the LLM can arrive at the correct answer.

2023; Cheng et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2023). However, these approaches (Hsieh et al., 2023) often represent reasoning steps in free-form text or code, which are not ideally suited for addressing scenarios involving complex tables, as shown in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b).

On the other hand, inference on tables typically involves a series of intermediate reasoning steps and each of them aligns with specific tabular operations. We propose CHAIN-OF-TABLE, where we conduct step-by-step reasoning as step-by-step tabular operations to form a chain of tables. The tables in the chain are the transformed tables by the tabular operations, representing the intermediate reasoning results. This procedure resembles the thought of reasoning in Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022). Specifically, we define a set of table operations, such as adding columns, selecting rows, grouping, and more, which are commonly-used in SQL and DataFrame development (PÃ¶nighaus, 1995; Shi et al., 2020; Katsogiannis-Meimarakis \& Koutrika, 2023). We then prompt LLMs to conduct step-by-step reasoning. In each step, the LLM dynamically generates an operation as the next step along with its required arguments, and then we execute the operation on the table programmatically. This operation can either enrich the table by adding detailed intermediate results or condense it by removing irrelevant information. Intuitively, visualizing the intermediate results is essential for reaching correct predictions. We feed the transformed table back for the next step. This iterative process continues until an ending state is achieved. We argue that the tables obtained during the reasoning steps are better structured representations of the intermediate thoughts than free-form text. Finally, the CHAIN-OF-TABLE reasoning results in tables from which it is easier for LLMs to derive a final answer to the question.

We validate CHAIN-OF-TABLE with three tabular benchmarks to evaluate table-based reasoning: WikiTQ (Pasupat \& Liang, 2015), TabFact (Chen et al., 2019), and FeTaQA (Nan et al., 2022). We conduct our experiments using proprietary PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023) and GPT-3.5 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), and open-sourced LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), to demonstrate that our proposed method CHAIN-OF-TABLE is able to generalize to various LLM options. We summarize our contribution as follows:

- We extend the concept of Chain-of-Thought to the tabular setting, where we transform the input table to store intermediate results. This multi-step tabular reasoning approach with table evolution leads to more accurate table understanding.
- Extensive experiments on table-based fact verification and question answering show that CHAINoF-TABLE archives state-of-the-art performance in WikiTQ, TabFact, and FeTaQA datasets.


## 2 RELATED WORK

Fine-tuning Language Model for Table Understanding Tables are effective in organizing, storing, and analyzing information. Efforts have been made to fine-tune language models (LMs) to tackle table understanding tasks. Following the successful mask language modeling (MLM) proposed in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), TaPas (Herzig et al., 2020) adopts this approach and asks the model to reconstruct certain cells in the table during pre-training. Pasta (Gu et al., 2022) and TUTA (Wang et al., 2021) further propose to mask the entire columns or segments in the table. On the other hand, TAPEX (Liu et al., 2021) pre-trains an encoder-decoder model with a large synthetic SQL dataset so that it can perform as a SQL executor to better understand the tabular structure. Eisenschlos et al. (2020) and Jiang et al. (2022) also leverage synthesized SQL with additional consideration of the alignment between SQL and natural language questions by pre-training the model with both natural and synthetic data.

Prompting Language Model for Table Understanding LLMs can learn from a few samples as prompts through in-context learning. This strategy is widely used to give models additional instructions to better solve downstream tasks. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) proposes to generate reasoning steps before answering instead of directly generating an end-to-end answer. Following CoT, Least-to-Most (Zhou et al., 2022) and DecomP (Khot et al., 2022) propose to break down the question into subproblems in the reasoning chain. During reasoning, the latter steps are aware of the previous ones. Such iterative chains with task decomposition further improve the results on complex problems by leveraging the intermediate results from solving subproblems. Jin \& $\mathrm{Lu}$ (2023) enhances CoT through a table-filling procedure, with a primary focus on text-based tasks where the input and output are in textual format. However, the line of works following CoT is not specifically designed for tabular data. As reported in Chen (2023), large language models with these generic reasoning methods can achieve decent results, but there are still gaps between these methods and those specialized for table scenarios (Cheng et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2023). We propose CHAINOF-TABLE to fill the gap by directly incorporating intermediate tables from tabular operations as a proxy of intermediate thoughts.

To better solve table-based tasks with LLMs, researchers go beyond general text and resort to using external tools. Chen et al. (2022); Gao et al. (2023) propose solving reasoning tasks by generating Python programs, which are then executed using the Python interpreter. This approach greatly improves the performance of arithmetic reasoning. In the scenario of table understanding, Text-toSQL with LLMs (Rajkumar et al., 2022) is a straightforward application of this idea. To further push the limits of programs, Binder (Cheng et al., 2022) generates SQL or Python programs and extends their capabilities by calling LLMs as APIs in the programs. LEVER (Ni et al., 2023) also proposes solving the table-based tasks with programs but with the additional step of verifying the generated programs with their execution results. However, the assistant programs in these programaided methods still fall short in solving difficult cases that involve complex tables. These limitations are primarily due to the constraints of the single-pass generation process, where the LLMs lack the capability to modify the table in response to a specific question, requiring them to perform reasoning over a static table. Our method, on the contrary, is a multi-step reasoning framework that conducts tabular reasoning step by step. It transforms the tables tailored to the given question.

To the best of our knowledge, Dater (Ye et al., 2023) is the only model that modifies the tabular context while solving table-based tasks. However, the table decomposition in Dater is motivated by the idea that tables could be too large for LLMs to conduct reasoning. It is, therefore, more similar to an LLM-aided data pre-processing than to a part of the reasoning chain since the tabular operations are limited to column and row selections, and fixed for all tables and questions. In contrast, our CHAIN-OF-TABLE generalizes a larger set of generic table operations and dynamically generates reasoning chains in an adaptive way based on the inputs, leveraging the planning ability (Valmeekam et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023) of LLMs.

## 3 CHAIN-OF-TABLE REASONING

Problem Formulation. In table-based reasoning, each entry can be represented as a triplet $(T, Q, A)$, where $T$ stands for the table, $Q$ represents a question or statement related to the table, and $A$ is the expected answer. Particularly, in the table-based question answering task, $Q$ and $A$ are the question and expected answer in natural language form; in the table-based fact verification task, $Q$ is a statement about the table contents and $A \in\{$ True, False $\}$ is a Boolean value that indicates the statement's correctness. The objective is to predict the answer $A$ given the question $Q$ and the table $T$. To facilitate table-based reasoning within the same paradigm employed for generic reasoning, we convert all data values, including tables, into textual representations (see Appendix D for the tabular format encoding method).

### 3.1 OVERVIEW

CHAIN-OF-TABLE enables LLMs to dynamically plan a chain of operations over a table $T$ in response to a given question $Q$. It utilizes atomic tool-based operations to construct the table chain. These operations include adding columns, selecting rows or columns, grouping, and sorting, which are common in SQL and DataFrame development (see Appendix A for more details).

Previously, Dater (Ye et al., 2023) employs a dedicated yet fixed procedure for decomposing tables and questions, which limits its compatibility with new operations. Also, Binder (Cheng et al., 2022), while potentially compatible with new operations, is restricted to those that work with code interpreters such as SQL or Python. In contrast, our framework is extendable and can incorporate operations from a wide range of tools thanks to the flexible in-context learning capability to sample and execute effective operations.

As illustrated in Algorithm 1, at each iteration, we prompt the LLM to sample one of the pre-defined atomic operations denoted as $\mathrm{f}$ using the corresponding question $Q$, the latest table state $T$, and the operation chain chain (Line 4). Then, we query the LLM to generate the required arguments args for $\mathrm{f}$ (Line 5) and execute it to transform the table $T$ (Line 6). We keep track of the operation $\mathrm{f}$ performed on the table in the operation chain chain (Line 7). The process finishes when the ending tag [E] is generated (Line 8). Finally, we feed the latest table into the LLM to predict the answer (Line 9). This series of operations serves as the reasoning steps leading LLMs to understand the input table and better generate the final answer.

```
Algorithm 1: CHAIN-OF-TABLE Prompting
    Data: $(T, Q)$ is a table-question pair.
    Result: $\hat{A}$ is the predicted answer to the question.
    Function Chain-of-Table $(T, Q)$ :
        chain $\leftarrow[([B], \phi)$,
        repeat
            $\mathrm{f} \leftarrow$ DynamicPlan $(T, Q$, chain $)$
            args $\leftarrow$ GenerateArgs $(T, Q, \mathrm{f})$
            $T \leftarrow \mathrm{f}(T$,args)
            chain $\leftarrow$ chain.append((f,args))
        until $f=[E]$
        $\hat{A} \leftarrow$ Query $(T, Q)$
    return $\hat{A}$
```


### 3.2 DYNAMIC PLANNING

CHAIN-OF-TABLE instructs the LLM to dynamically plan the next operation by in-context learning. As shown in Figure 2(a), DynamicPlan involves three components: the most recent intermediate table $T$ (Figure 2(a)(i)), the history of the previous operations chain chain (Figure 2(a)(ii)), and the question $Q$ (Figure 2(a)(iii)). We guide the LLM to select the subsequent operation $\mathrm{f}$ from the operation pool given ( $T$, chain, $Q$ ). The LLM is then able to dynamically plan the next operation and build a tabular reasoning chain step by step. See Appendix E. 1 for detailed prompts.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_732813e25e7b2f64ffdag-05.jpg?height=393&width=1312&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=404)

(a) DynamicPlan (T, Q, chain)

(b) GenerateArgs ( $T, Q, f$ )

Figure 2: Illustration of DynamicPlan( $T, Q$, chain) and GenerateArgs $(T, Q, \mathbf{f})$ in the proposed Chain-of-Table, where $T$ is a intermediate table; $Q$ is the question; chain is a list of operations already performed on the table; $f$ is the operation selected by DynamicPlan. Left: DynamicPlan samples the next operation from the operation pool, according to ( $T$, chain, $Q$ ). Right: GenerateArgs takes the selected operation $\mathrm{f}$ as input and generates its arguments based on $(T, \mathrm{f}, Q)$. The operations, along with their arguments, act as a proxy of the tabular reasoning process to effectively tackle table understanding tasks.

### 3.3 ARGUMENT GENERATION

The next step, GenerateArgs, involves generating arguments for the selected table operation $\mathrm{f}$ sampled by DynamicPlan, as depicted in Figure 2. GenerateArgs involves three key components: the most recent intermediate table $T$ (Figure 2(b)(i)), the selected operation $\mathrm{f}$ along with its arguments args (Figure 2(b)(ii)), and the question (Figure 2(b)(iii)). We employ simple regular expressions to account for varying number of arguments required by different operations (see Appendix E. 2 for more details). Finally, we apply programming languages to execute the operation and create the corresponding intermediate tables.

### 3.4 FINAL QUERY

We transform the table through dynamic planning (Section 3.2) and argument generation (Section 3.3). During this process, we create a chain of operations that acts as a proxy for the tabular reasoning steps. These operations generate intermediate tables that store and present the results of each step to the LLM. Consequently, the output table from this chain of operations contains comprehensive information about the intermediate phases of tabular reasoning. We then employ this output table in formulating the final query. As illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom right), we input both the output table and the question into the LLM, which provides the final answer to the question (see Line 9 in Algorithm 1).

## 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate the proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE on three public table understanding benchmarks: WikiTQ (Pasupat \& Liang, 2015), FeTaQA (Nan et al., 2022), and TabFact (Chen et al., 2019). WikiTQ and $\mathrm{FeTaQA}$ are datasets focused on table-based question answering. They require complex tabular reasoning over the provided table to answer questions. WikiTQ typically requires short text span answers, whereas FeTaQA demands longer, free-form responses. TabFact, on the other hand, is a table-based binary fact verification benchmark. The task is to ascertain the truthfulness of a given statement based on the table. For WikiTQ evaluation, we use the official denotation accuracy (Pasupat \& Liang, 2015), and for TabFact, we employ the binary classification accuracy. Given the nature of FeTaQA, which involves comparing predictions with longer target texts, we utilize BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) for assessment. In our experiments, we use PaLM 2-S ${ }^{1}$, GPT 3.5 (turbo-16k-0613) ${ }^{2}$, and LLaMA 2 (Llama-2-17B-[^1]

chat) $)^{3}$ as the backbone LLMs. We incorporate few-shot demo samples from the training set into the prompts to perform in-context learning. Examples of these prompts can be found in Appendix E. Details regarding the LLM inference parameters and the number of demonstration samples used are provided in Appendix C.

### 4.1 BASELINES

The baseline methods are categorized into two groups: (a) generic reasoning, which includes Endto-End QA, Few-Shot QA, Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022); and (b) program-aided reasoning, which includes Text-to-SQL (Rajkumar et al., 2022), Binder (Cheng et al., 2022), Dater (Ye et al., 2023)). Detailed descriptions of these baseline methods are provided below.

Generic Reasoning End-to-End QA guides the LLM to directly produce the answer when provided with a table and a question as input prompts. Few-Shot QA operates similarly, but it includes few-shot examples of (Table, Question, Answer) triplets in the prompt, as detailed in Brown et al. (2020). We select these examples from the training set, and the model also outputs the answer directly. Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) prompts the LLM to articulate its reasoning process in text format before delivering the question. See Appendix F for the prompts of baselines.

Program-aided Reasoning Text-to-SQL (Rajkumar et al., 2022) utilizes in-context samples to guide LLMs in generating SQL queries for answering questions. This approach follows the concepts introduced by Chen et al. (2022); Gao et al. (2023). Binder (Cheng et al., 2022) integrates a language model API with programming languages such as SQL or Python. This integration prompts the LLM to produce executable programs that perform table reasoning tasks on the given table and question. Dater (Ye et al., 2023) employs few-shot samples for efficient deconstruction of table contexts and questions, enhancing end-to-end table reasoning with decomposed sub-tables and sub-questions.

### 4.2 RESULTS

We compare CHAIN-OF-TABLE with generic reasoning methods and program-aided reasoning methods on three datasets: WikiTQ, TabFact, and FeTaQA. The results on WikiTQ and TabFact are presented in Table 1. We have additional results on FeTaQA in Appendix B. We follow the previous works and report the performance using the official evaluation pipeline ${ }^{4}$.

Table 1 shows that CHAIN-OF-TABLE significantly outperforms all generic reasoning methods and program-aided reasoning methods on TabFact and WikiTQ across PaLM 2, GPT 3.5, and LLaMA[^2]

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_732813e25e7b2f64ffdag-07.jpg?height=452&width=1287&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=403)

Figure 3: Performance of Chain-of-Thought, Dater, and the proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE on WikiTQ for questions that require an operation chain of varying lengths. Our proposed atomic operations allow our proposed method CHAIN-OF-TABLE to dynamically transform the input table through multiple reasoning iterations. This significantly improves performance over generic and programaided reasoning counterparts.

Table 2: Distribution of the number of samples v.s. the required length of operation chain in CHAINof-TABLE with PaLM 2 on WikiTQ and TabFact datasets. We observe that the majority of samples need 2 to 4 operations to generate the final output.

| Dataset | Length of operation chain |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | $\mathbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{2}$ | $\mathbf{3}$ | $\mathbf{4}$ | $\mathbf{5}$ |
| WikiTQ | 95 | 1308 | 1481 | 1084 | 341 |
| TabFact | 4 | 547 | 732 | 517 | 223 |

2. This is attributed to the dynamically sampled operations and the informative intermediate tables in Chain-of-TABle. Chain-of-TABle iteratively generates operations that act as proxies for tabular reasoning steps. These operations produce and present tailored intermediate tables to the LLM, conveying essential intermediate thoughts (see the example in Figure 4). With the support of CHAIN-OF-TABLE, the LLM can reliably reach the correct answer.

From the results, we observe a performance decrease on WikiTQ due to the complexity of tabular structure when vanilla Chain-of-Thought is introduced to End-to-End QA using PaLM 2. In contrast, our proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE consistently enhances End-to-End QA performance by $8.69 \%$ on TabFact and $6.72 \%$ on WikiTQ with PaLM 2.

We also observe that our proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE is effective across all backbone models experimented, while other competing methods, such as Binder, perform better on larger LLMs but its performance decreases with smaller LLaMA 2 (Llama-2-17B-chat). We attribute this decline to Binder's single-pass generation process. While Binder does incorporate API calls within its framework, it lacks the capability to modify and observe the transformed tables. Consequently, Binder can only perform the tabular reasoning over a static table, making it challenging to solve complicated cases with smaller LLMs.

### 4.3 Performance AnALYSIS UNDER DifFERENT OPERation Chain LENGTHS

In CHAIN-OF-TABLE, the selection of each operation is dynamically determined based on the difficulty and complexity of the questions and their corresponding tables. Therefore, we conduct a detailed study on the performance under different numbers of operations by categorizing the test samples according to their operation lengths. We report the distribution of the number of samples v.s. the required length of operation chain in Table 2. This analysis focuses on samples that require operations in the reasoning process. We use the results with PaLM 2 as an example. Our observations reveal that the majority of samples require 2 to 4 operations to generate the final output.

For each chain length, we further compare CHAIN-OF-TABLE with Chain-of-Thought and Dater, as representative generic and program-aided reasoning methods, respectively. We illustrate this using results from PaLM 2 on WikiTQ. We plot the accuracy of all methods using bar charts in Figure 3,

Table 3: Performance of Binder, Dater, and the proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE on small ( $<2000$ tokens), medium ( 2000 to 4000 tokens), large ( $>4000$ tokens) tables from WikiTQ. We observe that the performance decreases with larger input tables while CHAIN-OF-TABLE diminishes gracefully, achieving significant improvements over competing methods. (underline denotes the second-best performance; bold denotes the best performance; the improvement is measured against the secondbest performing method.)

| Prompting | Table Size |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | Small $(<2 \mathbf{k})$ | Medium $(2 k \sim 4 k)$ | Large $(>4 \mathbf{k})$ |
| Binder (Cheng et al., 2022) | 56.54 | 26.13 | 6.41 |
| Dater (Ye et al., 2023) | 62.50 | 42.34 | 34.62 |
| CHAIN-OF-TABLE (ours) | $\overline{68.13}(+5.63)$ | $\overline{52.25}_{(+9.91)}$ | ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_732813e25e7b2f64ffdag-08.jpg?height=43&width=182&top_left_y=719&top_left_x=1342) |

Table 4: Number of samples generated for a single question in Binder, Dater, and the proposed Chain-of-TABle on the WikiTQ dataset. Notably, ChAin-of-TABle generates the fewest samples among the baselines $-50 \%$ less than Binder and $75 \%$ less than Dater. For a detailed description of the steps involved in Binder and Dater, please refer to the corresponding papers.

| Prompting | Total \# of <br> generated samples | \# of generated samples <br> in each steps |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Binder (Cheng et al., 2022) | 50 | Generate Neural-SQL: 50 |
| Dater (Ye et al., 2023) | 100 | Decompose Table: $40 ;$ Generate Cloze: 20; <br> Generate SQL: 20; Query: 20 |
| CHAIN-OF-TABLE (ours) | $\leq \mathbf{2 5}$ | DynamicPlan: $\leq 5 ;$ GenerateArgs: $\leq 19 ;$ <br> Query: 1 |

highlighting the gap between the compared methods and our method. Notably, CHAIN-OF-TABLE consistently surpasses both baseline methods across all operation chain lengths, with a significant margin up to $11.6 \%$ compared with Chain-of-Thought, and up to $7.9 \%$ compared with Dater.

Generally, the performance of these methods decreases as the number of tabular operations required in the tabular reasoning chain increases due to higher difficulty and complexity of questions and tables. Nevertheless, our proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE declines gracefully compared to other baseline methods. For example, CHAIN-OF-TABLE exhibits only a minimal decrease in performance when the number of operations increases from four to five.

### 4.4 PERformance ANALYSIS UNDER DifFERENT TABLE SiZeS

Large tables present significant challenges to LLMs since LLMs often struggle to interpret and integrate contexts in long input prompts (Liu et al., 2023a; Ye et al., 2023). To assess the performance on tables of various sizes, we categorize the input tables from WikiTQ into 3 groups based on token count: small ( $<2000$ tokens), medium ( 2000 to 4000 tokens) and large ( $>4000$ tokens). We then compare CHAIN-OF-TABLE with Dater (Ye et al., 2023) and Binder (Cheng et al., 2022), the two latest and strongest baselines, as representative methods. Detailed results are presented in Table 3.

As anticipated, the performance decreases with larger input tables, as models are required to process and reason through longer contexts. Nevertheless, the performance of the proposed CHAinOF-TABLE diminishes gracefully, achieving a significant $10+\%$ improvement over the second best competing method when dealing with large tables. This demonstrates the efficacy of the reasoning chain in handling long tabular inputs.

### 4.5 EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS OF CHAIN-OF-TABLE

We analyze the efficiency of CHAIN-OF-TABLE by evaluating the number of required generated samples. We compare ChaIn-OF-TABLE with Binder (Cheng et al., 2022) and Dater (Ye et al., 2023), the two latest and most competitive baseline method. The analysis results on WikiTQ are presented in Table 4.

results. Dater involves multiple delicate yet fixed steps, such as decomposing the tables and generating cloze queries for the questions. In each step, Dater also employs self-consistency to improve accuracy of the LLM outputs, leading to a high number of required generated samples. For a detailed description of these frameworks, please refer to the corresponding papers, Ye et al. (2023) and Cheng et al. (2022).

Unlike these previous methods, our proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE employs a greedy search strategy in its tabular reasoning process, instead of relying on self-consistency sampling for boosting performance. This approach results in a reduced query count for our method, despite CHAIN-OF-TABLE adopting an iterative reasoning process. To be more specific, we observe that the number of queries needed by CHAIN-OF-TABLE is the lowest among the most recent baselines $-50 \%$ less than Binder and $75 \%$ less than Dater. We attribute the query efficiency of our method to the proposed dynamic operation execution through the tabular reasoning. The model is able to find an effective reasoning process that reaches the final output quicker and more reliably.

### 4.6 CASE STUDY

In Figure 4, we illustrate the tabular reasoning process by CHAIN-OF-TABLE. The question is based on a complex table and requires multiple reasoning steps to 1 ) identify the relevant columns, 2) conduct aggregation, and 3) reorder the aggregated intermediate information. Our proposed CHAINOF-TABLE involves dynamically planning an operation chain and accurately storing intermediate results in the transformed tables. These intermediate tables serve as tabular thought process that can guide the LLM to land to the correct answer more reliably.

## 5 CONCLUSION

Our proposed CHAIN-OF-TABLE enhances the reasoning capability of LLMs by leveraging the tabular structure to express intermediate thoughts for table-based reasoning. It instructs LLMs to dynamically plan an operation chain according to the input table and its associated question. This evolving table design sheds new light on the understanding of prompting LLMs for table understanding.

#### Abstract

In the domain of data science, the predictive tasks of classification, regression, and imputation of missing values are commonly encountered challenges associated with tabular data. This research endeavors to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing these predictive tasks. Despite their proficiency in comprehending natural language, LLMs fall short in dealing with structured tabular data. This limitation stems from their lacking exposure to the intricacies of tabular data during their foundational training. Our research aims to mitigate this gap by compiling a comprehensive corpus of tables annotated with instructions and executing large-scale training of Llama-2 on this enriched dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the practical application of applying the trained model to zero-shot prediction, fewshot prediction, and in-context learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, our methodology has shown significant improvements over existing benchmarks. These advancements highlight the efficacy of tailoring LLM training to solve table-related problems in data science, thereby establishing a new benchmark in the utilization of LLMs for enhancing tabular intelligence.


## 1. Introduction

Tables are used in various fields such as finance, data analytics, and logistics. In the context of data science, classification and regression as well as handling with missing values, the predominant tasks of predicting over tabular data, play a central role across diverse industries, attracting increasing interest in research of leveraging AI technologies to comprehend tabular data for improving the efficiency of processing[^0]

tasks related to tables.

The essence of tabular data resides in its complex, multidimensional interactions and structural intricacies, which present formidable challenges in capturing the nuanced internal semantics embedded therein. Previous efforts to address these challenges still encounter several problems: 1) Traditional methodologies explore a range of strategies for conducting feature engineering, from the implementation of embedding layers and cell modeling modules for the continuous vector representation of data (Yin et al., 2020a; Herzig et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Gorishniy et al., 2022; Wang \& Sun, 2022; Yang et al., 2024), to the adoption of textualization techniques to convert data into a natural language format (Gorishniy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Hegselmann et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). However, the development of feature engineering, tailored to specific tasks, often depends on human-derived assumptions and knowledge, limiting the models' ability to generalize due to the anchoring of the feature selection process in human biases and limitations. 2) Current approaches for employing LLMs in addressing tabular tasks rely heavily on converting tables into natural language texts through serialization methods (Gong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023). However, the absence of specialized pretraining on tables limits the potential benefits of leveraging LLMs for modeling tabular data and interpreting human instructions. 3) Although several existing methods (Gong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) entail continuously pretraining on tabular data, they predominantly focus on generic text-generation tasks, such as table-to-text,
generating SQL queries from text (text-to-SQL), and answering questions based on tables (TableQA). These approaches overlook more prevalent data science tasks, including classification, regression, and the management of missing values. 4) The absence of an extensive pretraining corpus of tables tailored for data science tasks, further impedes the applicability and transferability of existing methodologies (Herzig et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2023; Slack \& Singh, 2023). This deficiency may not adequately validate the model's adaptability across diverse tasks.

This study aims to explore the potential of LLMs in comprehending and leveraging the relational and semantic richness inherent in tabular data through large-scale, table-specific pretraining. To achieve this objective, we have compiled an extensive pretraining corpus comprising a diverse array of tables sourced primarily from Kaggle, which hosts vast quantities of tabular data in CSV format across approximately 300 domains. This corpus provides our model with exposure to a wide spectrum of tabular structures and content, thereby enhancing its capacity to generalize across different data types and facilitating a deeper understanding of the relationships within the tabular data. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward approach by adopting the self-supervised learning paradigm, inherent in LLMs, applied to our curated collection of tabular data, aiming to unearth intricate data patterns, automate feature engineering processes, and refine predictive modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce a unified training framework that seamlessly integrates table contents with task-specific instructions, enabling the execution of various training tasks and fostering reasoning between the provided instructions and the tabular data. With the innate human intent understanding capabilities offered by LLMs, our pretraining approach further equips LLMs with the combined benefits of table comprehension and natural language understanding, enabling them to effectively tackle challenging predictive tasks.

Our exploration into the large-scale pretraining of LLMs on tabular data and their subsequent application to tabular tasks in data science yields several significant contributions:

- We introduce an straightforward yet innovative pretraining approach tailored to acclimate LLMs to the specificities of tabular data, thereby expanding their utility beyond conventional language processing tasks to encompass a wide range of data science applications.
- We compile and leverage a vast and varied dataset, comprising approximately 13 billion examples across 300 domains, to facilitate this specialized pretraining. This dataset represents a substantial resource for advancing research in this field.
- Our trained model demonstrates impressive performance, substantiated through extensive experimental analysis and comparative assessments across 30 classification and regression tasks. Compared to the Llama2, our approach achieves an average improvement of $8.9 \%$ in classification tasks and $10.7 \%$ in regression tasks. For missing value prediction tasks, our model outperforms GPT-4 by $27 \%$. Furthermore, our model exhibits a significant $28.8 \%$ improvement in extremefew-shot (4-shot) predictions on diverse datasets and a notable $18.8 \%$ progress in tasks involving extensive context learning. In the context of extensive context learning, our model shows a remarkable performance increase of $25.9 \%$ over Llama-2 80K (Fu et al., 2024).


## 2. Related Works

Beyond traditional tree-based methodologies such as XGBoost (Chen \& Guestrin, 2016) and random forests, the field of solving tabular predictive problem has increasingly incorporated deep learning (DL) techniques. An illustrative example is NODE (Popov et al., 2019), which merges neural decision trees with dense connections. This approach enhances the ensemble model concept by combining the advantages of end-to-end gradient-based optimization with the hierarchical representation learning of tree-based methods. Nevertheless, such approaches results in increased model complexity, potentially diminishing their adaptability and capacity for generalization across diverse tasks. Additionally, the Transformer architecture has been adopted as a backbone in contemporary deep learning models (Wang et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020; Gorishniy et al., 2021; Hollmann et al., 2022; Wang \& Sun, 2022). For example, the TabTransformer (Huang et al., 2020) introduces column embeddings before their integration into the Transformer model, whereas the FT-Transformer (Gorishniy et al., 2021) employs a feature tokenizer to transform individual columns into vector form. Similarly, UniTabE (Yang et al., 2024) introduces a unified tabular encoder that supports pretraining on tables of various structures. However, these methodologies necessitate substantial expertise in the development of taskspecific feature engineering and architectural modifications, posing challenges to scalability and the standardization of approaches.

Recent advancements in the application of LLMs for tabular data tasks have initiated a breadth of investigations. TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020a) introduces an approach that involves transforming each table row into a sequence of text for the purpose of learning joint representations of structured tables and natural language utterances through specialized feature engineering. TUTA (Wang et al., 2021) employs a unique bi-dimensional tree structure to ascertain cell coordinates and calculate distances between cells. XTab (Zhu et al., 2023) explores the use of federated learning for the collaborative training of data-specific and shared

Illustration of the initial pretraining phase of a LLM applying the Mask-Then-Predict strategy (on the left), followed by the multi-task training phase customized for downstream tasks such as classification and regression (on the right). Through the former phase, the LLM acquires unstructured knowledge embedded within tables. Subsequently, during the latter phase, it enhances its capability for reasoning between instructions and tabular contents.

Transformer blocks. TabLLM (Hegselmann et al., 2023) engages in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks by transforming table rows into natural language texts, utilizing either manually created serialization templates or those derived from LLMs. A significant challenge encountered in the training processes of these models is the lack of a comprehensive pretraining corpus of tables specifically curated for data science applications, which limits the models' applicability and transferability. In an effort to avoid the direct training process, TabPFN (Hollmann et al., 2022) adopt in-context learning (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020) techniques while carrying out classification.

Although previous research has explored pretraining on tables, it is essential to delineate significant distinctions that set apart our approach: 1) Prior studies (Gu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) primarily concentrate on pretraining for textgeneration tasks rather than focusing on the predictive tasks pertinent to data science. This orientation towards generative capabilities does not directly address the nuanced needs of data science applications that require predictive modeling. 2) There is a notable scarcity of comprehensive training corpora specifically curated for data science scenarios. For example, TaPas (Herzig et al., 2020) augments BERT with additional positional embeddings tailored for encoding tabular data structures. Nevertheless, its pretraining regimen is predominantly geared towards semantic parsing and table question answering tasks, rather than predictive data science tasks. Similarly, PASTA (Gu et al., 2022) enhances the Transformer architecture with a specialized mechanism for table operation manipulation and is pretrained on a relatively limited dataset designed for sentence-table cloze tasks, aim- ing primarily at table-based fact verification applications. Recently, TableLlama (Zhang et al., 2023) undertakes finetuning on Llama-2 to facilitate the generation of target text across a broad spectrum of general tabular tasks of text generation, such as TableQA, table fact verification, and table-grounded dialogue generation. Consequently, these methodologies diverge significantly from ours in both focus and application, underscoring a distinct pathway pursued in our research.

## 3. Methodology

This section delineates the fundamental elements of our methodology, comprising the standardized approach to serialization for presenting LLMs with a unified format (\$3.1), the process of further training LLMs on tabular data (\$3.2), our assembled training corpus ( $\$ 3.3$ ), and the application of the trained model to downstream tasks (\$3.4). Subsequent subsections elaborate on each component of our approach in detail. Figure 2 visualizes our proposed bifurcated training regimen. The initial phase, illustrated in the left section of the figure, involves pretraining the LLM through a Mask-Then-Predict task, aiming to assimilate unstructured knowledge from tables. The subsequent phase, depicted in the right section, engages in tailored multi-task training for downstream applications, encompassing both classification and regression tasks.

down format over conventional tabular formats including CSV and HTML, we choose to serialize tables in Markdown. This decision is further justified by Markdown's capability to maintain the intrinsic structure of tables and support various structural formats with minimal requirement for complex feature engineering.

Furthermore, we utilize a unified prompt template, as illustrated in Figure 3, to amalgamate task-specific instructions with table content. This approach is intended to augment Large Language Models' (LLMs) proficiency in extracting and deriving insights from the text surrounding tables, thereby enhancing their capability to perform reasoning tasks that span both instructions and tabular data. Such a methodology highlights the critical role of adopting a structured, yet adaptable, input format in elevating the model's efficacy across an array of tabular tasks. This approach ultimately facilitates a uniform training and fine-tuning paradigm for LLMs, ensuring a consistent and effective method for enhancing model performance in processing and analyzing tabular data.

### 3.2. Two Stage Training with Tables

To conduct pretraining, we employ the Mask-Then-Predict objective, which mirrors the established Masked Language Model (MLM) approach in NLP, aiming to improve the model's contextual understanding and its grasp of relationships within table-related data. Our model also undergoes multi-task training tailored to downstream applications, intending to infuse the model with domain-specific knowledge pertinent to tabular content, thereby enhancing its proficiency in understanding table data. By integrating these objectives, our strategy seeks to combine generalization, context awareness, and task-specific skills, facilitating the development of versatile and effective models for diverse downstream applications.

Mask-Then-Predict Pretraining Following the MLM approach that leverages self-supervised learning inherent in the data, we adopt a Mask-Then-Predict strategy by randomly masking sections within input tables, thus enforcing the model to infer the obscured values from their surrounding context. Such a process significantly enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition from table data. In addi- tion, our method establishes a unified pretraining framework that encompasses a diverse set of tasks: predicting the names of columns, the numerical content of cells, and the textual content of cells. By engaging the model in these varied prediction tasks, this enables the model to develop a nuanced understanding of table structure, semantics, and the interplay between textual and numerical information within tables. Regarding the masking granularity within a table, it's more effective to consider the entire cell as the fundamental unit rather than individual tokens. This rationale is grounded in the fact that each table cell typically contains a discrete piece of information, often representing complete entities or attributes crucial to the understanding of the data's structural and semantic integrity. Such granularity also maintains the contextual coherence of the data and aids the model in comprehending the interrelationships among cells.

The challenge of encountering multiple missing values within a table commonly arises in real applications. To address this issue, the quantity of masked cells is dynamically varied during pretraining. The left section of Figure 2 elucidates a case with three masked cells. Those masked cell are substituted their content with distinctive sentinel tokens (for instance, " $<$ missing_value_0 0 ", â $<$ missing_value_1 $>$ ", ..., "<missing_value_\{N-1\}>"). Subsequently, the model is tasked with inferring the original content of these masked cells by utilizing the contextual cues emanating from the adjacent, unobscured cells.

Multi-Task Training for Downstream Task Apart from acquiring knowledge within tables via the Mask-Then-Predict pretraining, we further refine the model's specialization through multi-task training phase. This phase uses datasets tailored for classification and regression tasks, aimed at augmenting the model's capability to reason about tabular instructions and contents. This method also dedicates to bolstering transferability and performance across downstream tasks. It is important to note that the datasets used in training are distinct from those used for evaluation experiments. The training corpus is specifically enriched by annotating 12 regression and 12 classification datasets with instructions. This proactive exposure of the pretrained LLM to varied problem-solving contexts, mirroring downstream applications, is expected to cultivate a more comprehensive and adaptable understanding of task-specific demands. Consequently, this strategy should enhance the model's generalization, effectiveness, and ability to adjust to the nuances of downstream tasks.

As illustrated on the right side of Figure 2, each example is structured using our unified prompt template prior to being inputted into our model. To accommodate a variety of regression and classification tasks, our model is crafted to predict actual text sequences rather than single values or class probability distributions. This design choice avoids

relying on the integration of LLM with an additional head layer, thereby enabling the model to effectively meet diverse task requirements.

### 3.3. Pretraining Data Collection

To construct a comprehensive dataset of tables for our LLM pretraining, we engage in a dual-faceted data collection strategy. We first collect an extensive dataset from Kaggle for the Mask-Then-Predict objective, providing a broad and varied range of tabular data sourced from actual applications. This diversity enables effective learning from tables, enriching the model's knowledge base. In addition, for the goal of facilitating adaptation to downstream tasks, we meticulously annotate dominant tabular datasets, primarily those relevant to classification and regression tasks. This collected corpus guarantees that the model benefits from both the broad knowledge gained during LLM pretraining and the in-depth insights of tabular data, significantly boosting its versatility and effectiveness in a variety of real-world applications. About the license and ethical consideration, please refer to Appendix A.

Our tables for pretraining, sourced from Kaggle, spans 300 domains and includes 13 billion examples, ensuring comprehensive coverage across a wide range of fields. This diversity positions our model to potentially achieve domain independence, enhancing its versatility. Our study focuses on tabular data, specifically excluding image, audio, and video data. Hence, we categorize the data into numerical and textual types, common in data science, with numerical data processed to a precision of up to five digits. As illustrated in Figure 5, the bulk consists of numerical columns, highlighting a focus on quantitative data, including integers, decimals, and percentages. Textual columns make up nearly $40 \%$ of the dataset, encompassing unstructured text such

Figure 5. The data type distribution: the percentages of numerical columns and textual columns in our collected Kaggle tables.

Table 1. Comparison of statistics of our training corpus with prior work's pretraining datasets.

as descriptions, textual columns and labels. This blend not only enriches the model's comprehension of natural language content but also ensures a balanced dataset that isn't overwhelmed by numerical data alone.

Furthermore, we supplement our dataset with data aimed at adapting our LLM into downstream tabular tasks. This includes 12 classification datasets and 12 regression datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. ${ }^{1}$ These datasets are equipped with task-specific instructions. The list of datasets used to construct this corpus is detailed in the Appendix B. Table 1 presents the comparative statistics of our constructed dataset relative to those utilized in previous research. Our dataset encompasses a wide range of domains, featuring an extensive collection of examples.

### 3.4. Applications in Downstream Tasks

This section explores the application of our trained model to various downstream tasks, such as filling in missing table values, performing classification and regression, and executing broader tasks like zero-shot and in context learning. To prepare the model input, we insert task-specific descriptions and instructions into the unified prompt template. This enables the model to engage in reasoning between the provided instructions and tables, leading to accurate prediction of the desired output. Note that for these tasks, the "Answer" placeholder, as shown in the referenced figure of the unified prompt template, remains unfilled.[^1]

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_6300df0419c2b0808299g-06.jpg?height=477&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=211)

Figure 6. An illustration of our approach to learning in contexts of extreme length, with each example being sequentially organized using the uniform prompt template before being concatenated into the sequence of texts for model input.

Finetuning for Classification. Similar to traditional finetuing LLM for classification tasks, an additional classification head is integrated into our trained model. The model is optimized to minimize the cross-entropy loss, ensuring a more accurate alignment with the ground truth data. For the few-shot prediction, our trained model is finetuned with limited training examples or data points.

Finetuning for Regression. In a manner akin to classification, the model is augmented with an additional regression head for this task. The focus of optimization shifts to reducing the mean squared error (MSE) between the model's predictions and the actual values.

Finetuning for Missing Values Prediction. Addressing missing values within datasets is a common yet critical challenge in real-world applications. By employing the same methodology as in our mask-then-predict training, the model is adept at predicting missing values for every designated sentinel position.

In Context Learning Prior to making predictions on a target example, the model is presented with several contextual examples as depicted in Figure 6. These examples are structured using the unified prompt template, ensuring consistency in the model's input. The assembled texts from both context and target examples are concatenated into a singular input sequence, guiding the model to derive the target prediction from the provided context.

Zero-shot Prediction From a general perspective, the zeroshot prediction can be regarded as a special case of incontext learning that contains zero demonstration examples, where the example to be predicted is serialized and fed into the model without finetuning. For classification tasks, the model can also perform constrained decoding on specified tokens of options, enabling it to predict a class without prior explicit training on those categories.

## 4. Experiments

This section presents a comprehensive examination of our model's performance across various tasks, highlighting the experimental setup $\S 4.1$, overall results $\S 4.2$, and in-depth analyses $\S 4.3$ to elucidate the model's capabilities and limitations.

### 4.1. Experimental Setup

Implementation Details We employ the Llama-2 7B as the foundational architecture for our model, utilizing a highperformance computing cluster with NVIDIA A100 GPUs for efficient and capable training. We initiate training with a learning rate of $2 e-5$, balancing convergence speed with model stability. To accommodate large batch sizes, we use gradient accumulation with a step size of 4 . The Adam optimizer, with hyperparameters $\beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$, and $\epsilon=10^{-8}$, is adopted to ensure smooth and stable training progression. Following the masking recipe of BERT, a masking ratio of 0.15 is applied, randomly selecting cells for masking to bolster the model's competence with incomplete data. A warm-up ratio of 0.05 during the initial training phase helps prevent early instability by gradually adjusting the learning rate. In addition, numerical values are standardized to a precision of five decimal places to prevent excessively long numerical tokens. Tabular data can contain a wide range of information across multiple rows and columns, leading to the long sequence of model input. The context length determines how much of this data can be considered in a single model prediction. Inspired by recent research (Xiong et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024), we have adjusted the base of RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) to enhance the model's ability to manage longer contextual dependencies.

Baselines In this work, we adopt the XGBoost as the representative baseline for traditional tree-based methods. The configuration for XGBoost adheres to the default settings of the xgboost package. ${ }^{2}$ For preprocessing textual data for XGBoost, we employed one-hot encoding through the scikitlearn library. ${ }^{3}$ We also compare with GANDALF (Joseph \& Raj, 2023) that builds upon a tailored tabular processing unit combined with a gating mechanism and in-built feature selection. Furthermore, our comparative analysis incorporates a comprehensive range of Transformer-based models and pre-trained models, including Tapas (Herzig et al., 2020), TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020a), TabTransformer (Huang et al., 2020), TabPFN (Hollmann et al., 2022), TUTA (Wang et al., 2021), TabLLM (Hegselmann et al., 2023), and XTab (Collins et al., 2022), among others. Throughout the training of these models on downstream tasks, we follow the official hyperparameter settings to ensure a consistent[^2]

and fair comparison. Note that models initially not designed to support regression tasks in their official code, such as TUTA, are adapted by just modifying the output layer to produce a single numerical output.

Metrics The primary aim of this study is to further pretrain LLMs on tabular data, with an emphasis on applying these models to classification, regression, and filling missing values in the realm of data science. To assess the model's discriminative capacity and its effectiveness in distinguishing among different classes in classification tasks, we employ the ROC-AUC metric. For regression tasks, we utilize the coefficient of determination, $R^{2}$, as the evaluative metric. Additionally, to evaluate the model's proficiency in predicting missing values, both textual and numerical, we consider these values as text and apply the ROUGE-L metric (Lin, 2004) to compare the performance of various methods.

Benchmarks We have curated a collection of datasets to thoroughly evaluate our proposed method against existing approaches. The collection includes four classification and three regression tasks, all derived from Kaggle. Additionally, we have incorporated tasks from the publicly available tabular benchmarks (Grinsztajn et al., 2022). ${ }^{4}$ Within this subset of benchmarks, we drop tasks that are easy to ensure that our assessment accurately reflects the model's capability across a spectrum of challenges. For those tasks within the public tabular benchmarks, the abbreviated task name prefixed with " $n$ " indicates its dataset comprised solely of numerical features, whereas prefix of "c" signifies its dataset containing both textual and numerical features, thus offering a more complex evaluation scenario. This differentiation allows for an in-depth analysis of different models' performance across diverse data compositions prevalent in real-world applications.

### 4.2. Downstream Task Evaluation

Classification Table 2 presents the comparative performance of various methods on classification tasks, illustrating that our approach outperforms XGBoost, a traditionally prevalent method for tabular data analysis. XTab, employing pretraining techniques, emerges as a strong competitor to[^3]

XGBoost, underscoring the advantage of pretraining mechanism over conventional tree-based methods. In comparison to the Llama2 7B model, our method registers significant enhancements, evidencing the efficacy of our pretraining approach. Against a spectrum of pretrained models tailored for tabular data (such as TaBERT, TUTA, XTab, TabLLM, and others), our approach consistently delivers superior performance, indicating its practicality for real-world applications.

To extend the evaluation of our model's performance across a broader domain spectrum, we also engaged in comparative analyses with diverse methods on public tabular benchmarks. As depicted on the right part of Table 2, across 13 tasks, our model prevails as the leading performer, affirming its robust predictive modeling capability for datasets comprising numerical as well as mixed features. This reinforces the potential of our method as a versatile tool for various realworld scenarios involving composite tabular data. Moreover, Table 2 reveals a general trend where approaches exhibit diminished performance on mixed-feature tasks relative to purely numerical tasks. This performance disparity is particularly noticeable in models like TUTA. Nonetheless, our approach consistently achieves high ROC-AUC scores across different tasks, showcasing the robustness of our pretraining strategy that equitably accommodates numerical and textual data, backed by our training dataset rich in both data types.

Regression In the realm of regression, Table 3 presents the $R^{2}$ metrics across various tasks, conclusively demonstrating our method's superiority in regression analysis over a diverse dataset ensemble, sourced both from Kaggle and public domains. The uniformly high $R^{2}$ scores attest to our methodology's adeptness at discerning intricate patterns and relationships within tabular data, resulting in precise regression prediction. Overall, our model achieves an average performance improvement of $8.9 \%$ in classification tasks and $10.7 \%$ in regression tasks.

Filling in Missing Values Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method in filling in missing values. By simulating missing data through the random removal of cell content in tables, we tasked the model with predicting these absent values under varying conditions of data sparsity. Our model's performance is benchmarked against TableLlama (Zhang et al., 2023), Llama-2, and GPT-4. Despite TableLlama being an extension of Llama-2 and trained specifically on several tabular tasks (e.g. tableto-text, TableQA), its incremental performance gain over Llama-2 in handling missing values is modest. In contrast, our model demonstrates a significant improvement in performance, particularly noteworthy as the number of missing values increases, exhibiting a more resilient performance compared to GPT-4 with an overall improvement of around $27 \%$. This improvement in performance provides additional experimental support for the effectiveness of our pretrained

model in addressing missing values, thereby affirming its potential utility in applications related to data completion, data recovery and tabular data synthesis tasks.

Extremely Long Context Learning In the realm of tabular data tasks, the challenge of modeling long sequences is significant. The primary hurdles involve improving the Large Language Model's (LLM) ability to handle the wide-ranging complexity of such data. This includes overcoming issues like data sparsity and decoding the non-linear relationships within tables. To navigate these challenges, models must be adept at processing lengthy sequences and precisely interpreting the dynamic nature of tabular datasets. To this end, we have adjusted the base of RoPE to bolster long sequence modeling capabilities during the pretraining phase.

We further conduct the experiments under the scenario of extremely long context learning. For each test sample, we select k-nearest examples from training set as its context. We leverage sentence-transformers to convert each example into a vector representation based on natural language text. This conversion follows the format: "column-name-0 is cell-value- 0 , column-name- 1 is cell-value- $1, \ldots$ columnname- $\{\mathrm{N}-1\}$ is cell-value- $\{\mathrm{N}-1\}$ ". Such a conversion aids the LLM, particularly sentence-transformers, in discerning subtle distinctions among examples, more so than if the original table format were used directly. To maintain label balance, an equal number of examples from each class are selected.

Figure 9 presents the comparative performance of our model against the Llama-2 7 b $80 \mathrm{~K}$ model that supports up to $80 \mathrm{~K}$ tokens. The clear performance enhancement, quantified as an average improvement of $18.8 \%$, reveals that our model not only achieves higher scores, but also consistently surpasses the Llama-2 80K model as the context size expands.

Figure 9. Analysis of extremely Long context learning. We adopt the Llama-2 7B $80 \mathrm{~K}$ here as a good comparison that is capable of processing $80 \mathrm{~K}$ tokens as context. The $\mathrm{x}$-axis represents the number of examples included in the context, ranging from 0 to 48 .

This demonstrates our model's proficiency in mastering extremely long context learning.

Zero-shot Prediction The results of zero-shot prediction are also demonstrated in Figure 9. Our method achieves a ROC-AUC score of 0.54 and an accuracy rate of $68 \%$. The significant performance improvement against baseline model indicates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Few-shot Prediction To evaluate the few-shot prediction capabilities of our model and to understand its efficacy and potential in scenarios characterized by scarce or costly data acquisition, we conducted few-shot prediction experiments. These experiments, detailed in Figure 8, illustrates the model's performance on classification tasks with a varying number of training examples (shots), which are selected randomly. The experimental results reveal that our method obtains a average performance leap of $28.8 \%$ in extremefew-shot (4-shot) predictions across various dataset against baselines. The findings suggest that an increase in the num-

ber of shots generally tends to enhance performance across different methods and datasets, albeit to varying extents. Analysis of Figure 8 reveals that in scenarios with as few as four training examples, such as in the loan eligibility prediction task, most methods, including XGBoost, exhibit evaluation scores around 0.5 . Notably, methods based on pretraining surpass XGBoost in the 4 -shot scenario, underscoring the advantages of pretraining in leveraging knowledge from tabular data. Our approach, in particular, outperforms other methods significantly in scenarios with very limited training examples, like 4 or 8 shots, demonstrating its superior efficacy and advantage in the few-shot learning context against competitors such as XGBoost, TabPFN, XTab, and TabLLM. This demonstrates that our model excels in adapting to a new target domain by just using a small dataset. Generally, the performance differences between methods begin to converge as the number of training examples increases beyond 8 .

### 4.3. Analysis

Ablation Study We want to examine the individual contributions of our proposed pretraining objectives. Results from the ablation study are presented in Table 4. The removal of the Mask-Then-Predict objective results in a significant decrease in performance, underscoring its vital role in enabling effective learning from tabular data. Conversely, omitting the objective of adapting to downstream tasks leads to a lesser decline in performance, suggesting that while it
contributes value to the model, its impact is comparatively modest against the Mask-Then-Predict objective. The combined omission of both pretraining objectives results in a marked deterioration in performance, highlighting the synergistic benefit of these objectives in bolstering the model's overall capabilities.

Predicting as Imputing Missing Value \& CoT Prompting We are curious about the feasibility of predicting the target value in the way of filling missing value. An additional column, which represents the predicted target for classification task and whose values are designated as missing with the sentinel token, has been incorporated into the original table. Consequently, the model is tasked with predicting the missing value within the example. The results measured with ROC-AUC are demonstrated in Figure 10. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of combining our trained model with CoT (Chain-of-Thought) prompting (Wei et al., 2022). We supplement the original instruction with "Let's think step by step. You need to first give the predicted value in the placeholder of $<$ missing_value_ $0>$, and then explain your reasons or thoughts." The performance gain of our method against Llama-2 is clear as our model has been trained with the self-supervised training of Mask-then-Predict task. This reveals that our trained model copes well with learning the intrinsic relation within the given table and carrying out reasoning over the tabular contents before predicting the missing value. Compared with the baseline, we notice that our model obtains a consistent performance improvement while combining with CoT prompting indicating that our method has the potential of utilizing properties of LLM (e.g. integrating with CoT) while excelling in understanding tabular data.

The CoT (Chain-of-Thought) prompting method is also integrated into models to provide detailed reasoning or explanations for each step. Our model demonstrates the consistent performance improvement with CoT across all tasks.

tions on the performance of the proposed model, employing the Gini Index to quantify the extent of inequality in class distributions. Datasets are categorized into three distinct groups based on their Gini Index values, with the average ROC-AUC score computed for each method within these categories. The findings, depicted in Figure 11, indicate that while label imbalance constitutes a significant challenge for all algorithms, the method developed in this work experiences a relatively minor performance decline in such scenarios. This suggests its enhanced robustness and effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by uneven class distributions.

## 5. Conclusion

This study embarked on bridging the gap between Large Language Model (LLMs) and its application in processing structured tabular data, a staple in data science yet underexplored in LLM research. Through the pretraining of the Llama-2 model on a curated dataset from Kaggle and other tabular-focused sources, which includes approximately 13 billion examples across 300 domains, we have achieved substantial improvements in classification, regression, and missing value imputation tasks. The enhanced Llama-2 model demonstrates superior performance, with an average increase of $8.9 \%$ in classification and $10.7 \%$ in regression tasks, and a $27 \%$ improvement in missing value prediction accuracy over GPT-4. Moreover, the application of our method extends to few-shot prediction and extremely long context learning, further illustrating its versatility and effectiveness. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and the significant potential of well-pretrained LLMs for structured data analysis. Our work lays a foundational step for future research in applying LLMs to data science, aiming for improved analytical and predictive modeling capabilities.

#### Abstract

Pre-trained large language models (PLMs) underlie most new developments in natural language processing. They have shifted the field from application-specific model pipelines to a single model that is adapted to a wide range of tasks. Autoregressive PLMs like GPT-3 or PaLM, alongside techniques like few-shot learning, have additionally shifted the output modality to generation instead of classification or regression. Despite their ubiquitous use, the generation quality of language models is rarely evaluated when these models are introduced. Additionally, it is unclear how existing generation tasks-while they can be used to compare systems at a high level-relate to the real world use cases for which people have been adopting them. In this work, we discuss how to adapt existing application-specific generation benchmarks to PLMs and provide an in-depth, empirical study of the limitations and capabilities of PLMs in natural language generation tasks along dimensions such as scale, architecture, input and output language. Our results show that PLMs differ in their applicability to different data regimes and their generalization to multiple languages and inform which PLMs to use for a given generation task setup. We share best practices to be taken into consideration when benchmarking generation capabilities during the development of upcoming PLMs.


## 1 Introduction

Natural language generation tasks require generating understandable text given textual or nonlinguistic information as input, such as documents, tables, or other structured forms. These texts seek to achieve a communicative goal (e.g., summarize a document). The standard approach to tackle these problems over the last years has been to start with a pretrained encoder-decoder model like T5 (Raffel et al., 2020a) or BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and finetune it on a corpus that captures the downstream task. The recent much larger pretrained language models use a decoder-only architecture and upended this paradigm. These models enabled few-shot or in-context learning approaches in which a model is presented with one or more examples and tasked to continue generating without any finetuning. We refer to both kinds of pretrained models as PLMs.

Due to the lack of grounding in the specific task setup, few-shot learning in generation settings leads to a model approaching the communicative goal from very different angles. These diverse range of outputs make the typical reference-based automatic evaluation strategies largely incompatible. While human evaluation can be used to overcome this shortcoming, it is infeasible to monitor the performance of an actively training model this way or to re-run all evaluations every time a new model is introduced. This leads to the question how one should reliably monitor generation capabilities, a question that is only growing in importance as more tasks are approached by casting them into generation setups.

In this work, we evaluate 8 models in few-shot and finetuning settings on 27 generation tasks covering 14 languages via automatic evaluation, presenting the first large-scale benchmark of PLMs in conditional NLG settings. We discuss design choices and challenges to ensure a fair comparison between the different systems, including suitable methods, tasks, and metrics. Based on our empirical results, we derive recommendations that could be used for future benchmarks during the development of PLMs. To combat the need for repeating computationally expensive explorations, we investigate how many evaluation examples are necessary to identify differences between models and find that, in many cases, fewer than 500 examples are sufficient, which opens the path for future evaluation-only task developments.

## 2 Background and Related Work

The shift from specialized pipelines toward pretrained language models has led to significant changes in how models are evaluated. We now focus more on questions such as "how good are the learned representations?" instead of user-facing measures of utility. The changes manifested in leaderboards and standard benchmarks that aim to characterize a wide range of model capabilities (Ethayarajh and Jurafsky, 2020).

An additional recent shift is that from finetuning toward few-shot learning. Models like T5 (Raffel et al., 2020a), BART (Lewis et al., 2020a), and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) were finetuned on supervised datasets covering tasks including translation and summarization, and their outputs are compared to "ground truth" outputs via widely used metrics like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) which provide a noisy indication of the "quality" of the output and which can be used to determine whether a model is better than others. ${ }^{1}$ In contrast, large PLMs with autoregressive language modeling pretraining objectives are more capable to produce results without explicit finetuning and are thus typically evaluated via few-shot and in-context approaches, where the model is given the task description and exemplars showing how the task should be completed. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and models that followed such as GLaM (Du et al., 2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), have achieved few-shot state-of-the-art results on a large number of tasks at their time of publication. However, few-shot approaches work best for tasks with a clear answer such as classification or span-based question-answering. ${ }^{2}$

Generation metrics penalize systems when their writing style differs from how the references are written (Mathur et al., 2020; Freitag et al., 2020; Mille et al., 2021). Without finetuning, there is no guarantee that PLMs produce outputs that look like the ground truth, both in style and content. Recent work found that these differences leads to sharp differences in how humans and automatic metrics rate the generation quality (Goyal et al., 2022). Due to this uncertainty, most evaluations of new PLMs[^0]

are limited to NLU benchmarks such as SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019). For example, LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) did not evaluate on NLG tasks, GLaM (Du et al., 2022) limited its generation evaluation to short span question answering tasks, and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) evaluated only on machine translation. A first autoregressive PLM with broad NLG evaluation, PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), benchmarked summarization and data-to-text tasks in multiple languages.

The recent Holistic Evaluation of Language Models project (HELM, Liang et al., 2022) aims to standardize evaluation of language models. With the explicit goal to broaden the task and metric coverage, HELM has established an impressive few-shot benchmark for many natural language tasks. Corroborating the prior findings, they also conclude that human evaluation is necessary for NLG. This distinction means that the referencebased approach for generated text that the field has used since the advent of deep learning may no longer sufficient and that we need clear evaluation protocols that continue to allow us to answer broad questions about "generation quality" of a model. Complementing this work, we take a deeper look at a wider set of NLG tasks and explore LLMs in finetuning and few-shot setups to identify whether reference-based automatic evaluation can still be used to produce system rankings.

Research Questions We aim to define a methodology that allows us to answer the question "How good are learned representations of a model for generating natural language?" via few-shot and finetuning approaches. To develop and apply this methodology we seek to answer the following three research questions:

## R1 How do different model architectures compare

 in terms of automatic metrics?We aim to identify patterns that emerge in evaluations and to uncover aspects inherent to the tasks, e.g. have metrics on specific tasks saturated?, and to the models' architectural choices, e.g., are encoder-decoders better suited for particular task formulations? (Section 4)

$\mathbf{R 2}$ What set of tasks, methods, and metrics is best suited for the monitoring of improvements in language generation capabilities?

Using the results of $\mathrm{R} 1$, we aim to select a subset of tasks, methods, and metrics that robustly produce reliable model rankings. (Section 5)

R3 What are the broader implications for how the quality of newly developed models should be monitored?

Robustly ranking systems is particularly important when monitoring a system during training and when comparing across many tasks. In line with the "reality check" theme track at ACL 2023, we discuss the implications of our findings on how evaluation results should be produced and interpreted. (Section 6)

## 3 Method

### 3.1 Data

We select a combination of data-to-text and textto-text datasets as different input modalities. The selected datasets capture different input and output lengths, domains, languages, and communicative goals. The text-to-text task with most available multilingual datasets is summarization which we pick for this paper. ${ }^{3}$ We pick the following tasks: ${ }^{4}$
- MLSum (Scialom et al., 2020) - Summarize a news article in multiple sentences.
- WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020) - Generate section headers for step-by-step instructions from WikiHow.
- XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) - Generate the first sentence of a news article.
- Clean E2E NLG (Novikova et al., 2017; DuÅ¡ek et al., 2019) - Given a set of key-value attribute[^1]

pairs, describe a restaurant in one or two sentences.

- Czech Restaurant response generation (Dusek and Jurvc'ivcek, 2019) - Given a dialog context and a dialog act representation, generate a one sentence long response.
- WebNLG 2020 (Gardent et al., 2017; Ferreira et al., 2020) - Verbalize subject-predicate-object triples in one or more sentences.
- ToTTo (Parikh et al., 2020) - Describe highlighted cells in a table in a single sentence.
- XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021) - Summarize a news article, in the same language, in a single sentence.

Table 1 provides an overview of these datasets in terms of languages, the lengths of input and output and split sizes. For highly multilingual datasets, we evaluate on a subset of typologically diverse languages following the selection by Clark et al. (2020). To this selection, we add languages that appear bothin WikiLingua and XL-Sum.

### 3.2 Models

Prior results for the benchmarked tasks primarily come from finetuning T5 (Raffel et al., 2020b), mT5 (Xue et al., 2021), or BART (Lewis et al., 2020b), which are encoder-decoder models pretrained with an infilling objectives. These models are significantly smaller than newer models like GPT-3, with sizes ranging from $130 \mathrm{M}$ to $13 \mathrm{~B}$ parameters. Encoder-decoder models trained for infilling often outperform larger decoder-only LMs in the finetuning setting (Tay et al., 2022), while the latter work better for few-shot setting. There has also been recent work on reducing the computational cost of large models by $\sim 10 x$ by using a mixture of experts (Zoph et al., 2022). It is important to compare these diverse set of models to understand how scale plays a role with the model's architecture and its pretraining. We benchmark the following models: 5

- PaLM PaLM is a pretrained decoder-only transformer-based model trained with standard left-to-right language modeling objective. It is pretrained on a range of multilingual corpora including Wikipedia, news, and code. In this work, we use two models scales: 8B parameters and 540B parameters.[^2]
- GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022b) GPT-3.5 is a 175B parameter decoder-only transformermodel of the GPT-3 family (Brown et al., 2020) but trained on a blend of text and code from before Q4 2021. This model, named codedavinci-002, was introduced as the base model for InstructGPT-3 (Ouyang et al., 2022b) without the supervision on human-written demonstrations and human-vetted model samples. ${ }^{6}$
- ST-MoE (Zoph et al., 2022) ST-MoE is a 269B sparse pretrained variant of a dense encoderdecoder transformer-based model.

### 3.3 Few-shot evaluation methodology

To evaluate the models for few-shot inference, we concatenate a task-specific prompt ${ }^{7}$ to the input and prepend an output prompt to the output. To handle the oftentimes very long inputs or outputs for tasks such as summarization, inputs were truncated to 2048 tokens and inference was done providing only one exemplar at a time, referred to as 1 shot. These simple prompts are analogous to those used in related work (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022). We do not tune the prompts or use more complex strategies to keep fair comparisons between multiple systems, as prompt selection can lead to overfitting. The exemplars are separated through double linebreaks, which are also used[^3]

to truncate output predictions for evaluation. All few-shot exemplars are randomly sampled from the training corpus. From early experimentation, we found this particularly important since it avoids overfitting to exemplars that work well for one model but not another.

### 3.4 Finetuning methodology

To use the decoder-only architectures during finetuning, inputs and targets are concatenated. The concatenated sequences are truncated to 2048 tokens, the training context used during pretraining, with 512 tokens reserved for the target. Only summarization tasks required input truncation. We finetuned models with standard hyperparameters; refer to Appendix-B for thorough details. The best model checkpoint for each dataset was selected by the best performing geometric mean of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores on the validation set. Decoding was done with beam-search with a beam size of 4 for encoder-decoder models, while inference in decoder-only PLMs (LaMDA, PaLM, ST-MoE) was performed using top-k sampling with $k=10$, due to issues with scaling beam search at the time of publication.

### 3.5 Metrics

Following the suggestions by Gehrmann et al. (2022b), we report a combination of lexical and learned metrics, starting with ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004). Since the default ROUGE implementation uses English-specific tokenization, stemming and punctuation normalization, it is incompatible with other languages. Hasan et al. (2021) extended ROUGE by integrating additional stemmers and tokenizers to cover up to the 45 languages. To support more languages, and avoid dependency on varying implementations, we use a SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) which, provided a vocabulary distribution file, is self-contained and has sensible fall-backs to unexpected words. Specifically, we used mT5's SentencePiece vocabulary.

For the same reason, we also evaluate with ChrF (PopoviÄ, 2015), which is a character-level n-gram overlap metrics and thus independent from tokenizers. BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020; Pu et al., 2021) is a multilingual model-based evaluation metric for generation designed to compute the similarity between a pair of sentences i.e. a reference and a candidate. It finetunes RemBERT (Chung
et al., 2021) on synthetic sentence pairs and gold ratings. In contrast to the lexical metrics, BLEURT is meant to capture the non-trivial semantic similarities between two texts.

For brevity, the main text of this section focuses on the F-measure of ROUGE-L for English and SentencePiece-ROUGE-L for all other languages while the remaining results are in Appendix A. We additionally investigate the agreement between metrics in Section 5. ${ }^{8}$

## 4 Empirical Observations

Few-shot learning falls behind finetuning For many generation tasks, including multilingual summarization tasks, we observe a large gap between finetuning and few-shot results, indicating that finetuning will play an important role when it comes to maximizing automatic scores. On data-to-text, the few-shot results follow a similar trend as in summarization, but the gap to the best finetuned results shrinks drastically. Moreover, the finetuning result do not always follow a trend according to scale or architecture. We hypothesize that multiple tasks have saturated to the metrics. If this is the case, approaching them as few-shot generation tasks may still yield insights but it is no longer productive to use them to benchmark finetuned models.

Finetuned decoder-only PLMs can match encoder-decoder performance with scale In summarization, finetuned decoder-only PLMs, such as PaLM-540B, closely match or exceeds the best reported prior results on all English generation tasks. This demonstrates that PLMs can make up their architectural disadvantage through its vastly increased scale. While finetuning PLMs is computationally expensive, it serves as an important upper bound for few-shot predictions.

Multilingual generation capabilities are highly dependent on pretraining data The PLMs evaluated are mostly pretrained on English corpora: 99+\% for T5, LongT5, ST-MoE; $90 \%$ for PaLM, LaMDA; contrarily mT5 is explicitly pretrained[^4]

in a multilingual corpus. ${ }^{9}$ PaLM achieves best results in 3 out of 4 English generation tasks which generate English text, even when the input is nonEnglish. However, the much smaller mT5 bests the other models in 10 out of 14 non-English summarization tasks, and the relative difference between few-shot and finetuning is larger for nonEnglish generation. This suggests that Englishcentric PLMs are better at processing non-English input than generating non-English output.

## Analyzing the effects of input context length

 Tasks with long inputs suffer from models' limitation to process said inputs. Inputs are thus usually transformed (e.g. cropped, re-ranked, etc) to fit into the model. We found that a several of the evaluated tasks, such as WikiLingua and MLSum benefit from a longer input context in models even if the long-context model is smaller (i.e., LongT5 vs T5). In contrast, the performance is comparable for the rest of short-context tasks.```
Given a natural language generation task:
Step 1: Is few-shot learning (A) or finetuning (B)
best suited?
    i) Inconsistent system rankings might indicate
        tasks are saturated. Few-shot learning will be
        more sensible to monitor in those cases.
    ii) Encoder-decoder baselines are strong
        performers regardless of smaller scale.
```

Step 2-A: How best to benchmark few-shot learning?
i) Avoid curating prompts to individual PLMs.
ii) Randomly select exemplars for prompts.
iii) Control for output length outliers.
Step 3: What is an efficient test set size?
i) Pick the smallest size that produces
consistent system rankings.
ii) Evaluate more datasets rather than larger
evaluations, adhering to (3.i).
Step 4: What metrics are best suited for the task?
i) Effective automatic metrics should provide
consistent system rankings.
ii) Overlap-based metrics are not calibrated for
few-shot learning.
iii) Human evaluation is vital if comparing
few-shot vs finetuning.

Table 2: ROUGE-L and SentencePiece-ROUGE-L results on data-to-text and compression datasets. Best results in bold. Few-shot results lag behind finetuned results and the gap increases as tasks become more complex. The non-English performance mostly follows the trend that higher percentages of non-English pretraining data leads to better performance. Despite their much smaller size, encoder-decoder model frequently much larger decoder-only models after finetuning.

and benchmarking PLMs during training or inference.

Comparable few-shot learning evaluation As mentioned in Section 3, our design choices were made to ensure that results are comparable across PLMs. Primarily, prompts were deliberately kept extremely simple and all few-shot exemplars were randomly sampled. While highly curated prompts or methods like chain-of-thought prompting can increase the performance considerably (Wei et al., 2022b), it can also lead to overfitting to the particular model the prompt was developed on, in turn making a comparison to other models unfair and producing unrealistic expectations when people have single interactions with it.
Overlap-based metrics are not calibrated to evaluate few-shot learning Few-shot generation suffers from not being able to predict output length properly given the few exemplars provided. While encoder-decoder models utilize endof-string tokens, these are not always learned during decoder-only pretraining. To circumvent this issue, researchers rely on PLMs match to the fewshot format provided e.g. line-breaks that separate exemplars. We observed PLMs fail to follow the format a significant number of times, producing the largest allowed length on occasion. In our experiments, we tried to avoid very long outputs by trimming outputs to the 95 -percentile length seen in the targets. ${ }^{10}$ Still, few-shot output lengths[^6]are on average 2-3 times the average target length while finetuned model's output average $80 \%$ the average target length, across all tasks. Overlap metrics used in generation are sensitive to length (Sun et al., 2019) making a natural disadvantage for few-shot learners. We do not recommend using overlap-based metrics to compare few-shot results without length normalization.

## Computational costs can be decreased without

 sacrificing relative model performance The computational cost of evaluating large datasets, some with more than $10 \mathrm{~K}$ examples, are prohibitive and perhaps unnecessary. To that end, we investigate if a model ranking can be produced, with a high degree of certainty, while only considering a random subset of the test set, saving compute cost to possibly evaluate on more tasks instead. To investigate this effect, we ran the following experiment: (1) Sample $n$ datapoints from a dataset and all corresponding model scores. (2) Following Kocmi et al. (2021) and Graham et al. (2014), we perform Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (Wilcoxon, 1946) to assess the stability of the ranking. (3) Repeat steps $1 \& 2 k$ times and record the fraction of runs in which models scores from any two models were not distinguishable from each other (those with a $p$-value of $>0.05$ ). Since we are considering 10 model settings in this work, this experiment considers all 45 possible pairs.The result shown in Figure 2 provides insight into the required number of data points to produce rankings. For most datasets, we can produce stable model rankings with only 500 examples, some with as little as 100 . Tasks where models achieve very similar scores tend to require more test examples, since smaller score differences require more examples to be distinguishable from each other (Wei and Jia, 2021). ${ }^{11}$

Analyzing metrics utility We use different automated metrics to evaluate the generation quality of the models. These metrics attempt to capture the similarity between system generated output and the reference text. While ROUGE and chrF account for the lexical overlap, BLEURT is meant to compute the semantic similarity. It is important to understand the agreement between these metrics. We compute the the system-level agreement via Spearman correlation coefficient (Spearman, 1987) between the scores given by the metrics to[^7]

the fine-tuned set of models. Figure 3 shows the correlation between ROUGE-L (RL), BLEURT and ChrF. We observe that the metrics are highly correlated for most datasets. Similar to Figure 2, on the tasks where the models have similar performance, we notice less correlation among the metrics. Such tasks are may have either saturated performance, e.g., ToTTo (en) or all models perform poorly, e.g., Wikilingua (es-> en). Due to the small differences between models, metrics fail to produce the same rankings.

## 6 Discussion and Reality Check

In line with our goal to provide a "reality check" via empirical and theoretical research, and to reflect on the ways in which reported performance improvements are meaningful, we want to situate our findings in the context of the broader NLP community. Openly accessible APIs and publicly available large models have led to increased attention on large pretrained models, but they have also led to a "release-then-test" philosophy where models are released without extensive evaluations. While the findings we present in this paper do not
solve this issue, agreeing on a shared evaluation process could lead to more realistic claims about model performance (and shortcomings), and allow for a more accurate monitoring of models during training.

What claims can we not make? Empirical findings demonstrate that incorporating generation into NLU tasks via Chain-of-Thought leads to better model performance (Wei et al., 2022b; Suzgun et al., 2022). Providing additional grounding via finetuning on instructions and aligning a model to human feedback leads to better task-specific performance without supervision (Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022a). However, we lack the scientific methods to quantify these advances. While benchmarks provide an indication whether a model is performing better than a previous iteration, and projects like BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) and HELM (Liang et al., 2022) enable evaluation on a very wide range of possible tasks, they are also inherently limited.

When benchmarking models in few-shot settings, especially models for which little information about their training data is available, it is hard to disambiguate model performance from memorization, i.e. if the examples were seen during pretraining. Instruction tuning further blur the line between finetuning and few-shot, which can lead to very different outputs and are not fully comparable. It is thus near impossible to make claims about why a model is succeeding at one particular task without having access to its training data.

As mentioned earlier, the target of this work is to derive best practices for comparing models in generation settings with constrained computational budgets, for example when monitoring a training model or when trying to compare on many different tasks. Our findings are grounded in much prior work that finds that metrics have a very high agreement with human judgments on the systemlevel (e.g., Kocmi et al., 2021), but are essentially meaningless on the segment-level. For that reason, we cannot derive claims beyond these rankings about utility of a model or whether a particular model would actually produce useful outputs for a task. To derive such insights, we point to work on extrinsic evaluation which requires comprehensive human evaluations (e.g., Lee et al., 2022).

How can our findings be applied to improve the status quo? Since the generation capabilities of
PLMs are currently not extensively monitored or evaluated, we set out to derive best practices for how these evaluations can look. We found that many of the "easy" tasks, on which finetuned models saturate the metrics, still yield insights for fewshot approaches. We further identified the tension between doing a computationally expensive full evaluation on a dataset and adding more evaluation sets for different tasks or languages. Our findings suggest that evaluation on small subsets of more tasks can be beneficial to the overall results.

To further motivate this suggestion, consider the following thought experiment: We have two tasks, A and B. At 500 examples, they have a risk of producing a "wrong" ranking of $10 \%$. At 1,000 examples, they have a risk of producing a wrong ranking of $5 \%$. These risks are not correlated, i.e., their covariance is 0 . Given a computational budget of evaluating on 1,000 examples, the risk of only evaluating on one dataset is $5 \%$, and the risk of producing two wrong ratings after evaluating on A and B is only $1 \%$. While additional datasets introduce a larger risk of one individual dataset producing misleading results ( $18 \%$ in this case), one can easily expand this argument to a whole portfolio of tasks to hedge against individual dataset risk (Stuart and Markowitz, 1959). Many existing NLU benchmarks like BIG bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) already follow such a strategy and we believe that generation evaluation, especially considering the additional risk due to metrics, should follow this approach for the use cases discussed in this work. To further minimize the individual dataset risk, they can be switched out once they saturate or their sample sizes increased.

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we produced an extensive evaluation of a diverse set of state-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs) for 27 different multilingual generation tasks under few-shot learning and finetuning settings. We discuss empirical results that help inform practitioners which tasks, methods and metrics are suitable. We provide recommendations on how best to monitor conditional generation capabilities of PLMs, including how to fairly benchmark few-shot learning, automated metrics and their utility, and how to efficiently utilize computational resources. We hope that such findings and recommendations could positively influence natural language evaluation in future work.

## 8 Limitations

In this work, we have presented results that help inform us what tasks, methods and metrics are best suited for monitoring as well as methodologies and empirical information about the current set of models. We provide detailed information of how these results can be reproduced, to the extend that research have access to the PLMs in question, but these results have limitations, in order to reduce costs, many languages were not evaluated which might have left unforeseen patterns not discussed in this work. Moreover, few-shot learning, in particular, could exhibit large variance if different prompts were chosen, or a different set of exemplars chosen. Because of the high costs involved our work does not explore the performance difference when multiple sets of hyper-parameters were chosen.

On the conceptual level, we make the assumption that system-level improvements on our tasks translate to downstream usefulness. While prior work suggests that this is the case, tools like chatGPT have significantly expanded the possible application space beyond the realm of "typical" NLP tasks, and we don't know how well our findings generalize to this space of tasks.

## 9 Ethics Statement

This paper focuses on conditional generation tasks where models are free to generate long text sequences. Typical issues associated with text generation such as hallucinations, memorization of private information publicly available, toxic and discriminatory language, or sensitive generated content could and are likely to arise. measuring the extent to which these issues occur is a necessary and crucial additional dimension of model evaluation which we do not include in this work, which should be seen as supplemental.

#### Abstract

In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closedsource models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Ð¡hat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.

Figure 1: Helpfulness human evaluation results for Llama 2-CHat compared to other open-source and closed-source models. Human raters compared model generations on $\sim 4 \mathrm{k}$ prompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. The $95 \%$ confidence intervals for this evaluation are between $1 \%$ and $2 \%$. More details in Section 3.4.2. While reviewing these results, it is important to note that human evaluations can be noisy due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, subjectivity of individual raters, and the inherent difficulty of comparing generations.

To complement the human evaluation, we used a more capable model, not subject to our own guidance. Green area indicates our model is better according to GPT-4. To remove ties, we used win/(win + loss $)$. The orders in which the model responses are presented to GPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in complex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized domains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive chat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.

The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training methodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data, followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs (such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed "product" LLMs, such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in compute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within the community to advance $\mathrm{AI}$ alignment research.

In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, LLAMA 2 and LLAMA 2-CHAT, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested, Llama 2-Ð¡hat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to be on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see Figures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data annotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally, this paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving LLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and continue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs. We also share novel observations we made during the development of LLAMA 2 and LLAMA 2-CHAT, such as the emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.

Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for Llama 2-CHAT compared to other open-source and closedsource models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across $\sim 2,000$ adversarial prompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is important to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these safety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the Llama 2-Ð¡ÐAÑ models.

We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use ${ }^{\ddagger}$ :

1. Llama 2, an updated version of Llama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also increased the size of the pretraining corpus by $40 \%$, doubled the context length of the model, and adopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of Llama 2 with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper but are not releasing. ${ }^{\S}$
2. Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release variants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.

We believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs, Llama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021; Solaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not - and could not - cover all scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2-Chat, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We provide a responsible use guide ${ }^{\mathbb{I I}}$ and code examples" to facilitate the safe deployment of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. More details of our responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3.

The remainder of this paper describes our pretraining methodology (Section 2), fine-tuning methodology (Section 3), approach to model safety (Section 4), key observations and insights (Section 5), relevant related work (Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).[^1]

Figure 4: Training of Llama 2-Chat: This process begins with the pretraining of Llama 2 using publicly available online sources. Following this, we create an initial version of Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ through the application of supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, the model is iteratively refined using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methodologies, specifically through rejection sampling and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Throughout the RLHF stage, the accumulation of iterative reward modeling data in parallel with model enhancements is crucial to ensure the reward models remain within distribution.

## 2 Pretraining

To create the new family of Llama 2 models, we began with the pretraining approach described in Touvron et al. (2023), using an optimized auto-regressive transformer, but made several changes to improve performance. Specifically, we performed more robust data cleaning, updated our data mixes, trained on $40 \%$ more total tokens, doubled the context length, and used grouped-query attention (GQA) to improve inference scalability for our larger models. Table 1 compares the attributes of the new Llama 2 models with the Llama 1 models.

### 2.1 Pretraining Data

Our training corpus includes a new mix of data from publicly available sources, which does not include data from Meta's products or services. We made an effort to remove data from certain sites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We trained on 2 trillion tokens of data as this provides a good performance-cost trade-off, up-sampling the most factual sources in an effort to increase knowledge and dampen hallucinations.

We performed a variety of pretraining data investigations so that users can better understand the potential capabilities and limitations of our models; results can be found in Section 4.1.

### 2.2 Training Details

We adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture from Llama 1. We use the standard transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings (RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences from Llama 1 include increased context length and grouped-query attention (GQA). We detail in Appendix Section A.2.1 each of these differences with ablation experiments to demonstrate their importance.

Hyperparameters. We trained using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with $\beta_{1}=$ $0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$, eps $=10^{-5}$. We use a cosine learning rate schedule, with warmup of 2000 steps, and decay final learning rate down to $10 \%$ of the peak learning rate. We use a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0. Figure 5 (a) shows the training loss for Llama 2 with these hyperparameters.

|  | Training Data | Params | Context <br> Length | GQA | Tokens | LR |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| LLAMA 1 | See Touvron et al. <br> $(2023)$ | $7 \mathrm{~B}$ | $2 \mathrm{k}$ | $x$ | $1.0 \mathrm{~T}$ | $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$ |
|  |  | 13B | $2 \mathrm{k}$ | $x$ | $1.0 \mathrm{~T}$ | $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$ |
|  |  | 33B | $2 \mathrm{k}$ | $x$ | $1.4 \mathrm{~T}$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |
|  |  | 65B | $2 \mathrm{k}$ | $x$ | $1.4 \mathrm{~T}$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| LLAMA 2 | A new mix of publicly <br> available online data | $7 \mathrm{~B}$ | $4 \mathrm{k}$ | $x$ | $2.0 \mathrm{~T}$ | $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$ |

|  |  | 34B | $4 \mathrm{k}$ | $\checkmark$ | $2.0 \mathrm{~T}$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |
|  |  | $70 B$ | $4 \mathrm{k}$ | $\checkmark$ | $2.0 \mathrm{~T}$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |

Table 1: Llama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of $4 \mathrm{M}$ tokens. Bigger models - 34B and 70B - use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.

Figure 5: Training Loss for Llama 2 models. We compare the training loss of the Llama 2 family of models. We observe that after pretraining on 2T Tokens, the models still did not show any sign of saturation.

Tokenizer. We use the same tokenizer as Llama 1; it employs a bytepair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich et al., 2016) using the implementation from SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). As with Llama 1, we split all numbers into individual digits and use bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. The total vocabulary size is $32 \mathrm{k}$ tokens.

### 2.2.1 Training Hardware \& Carbon Footprint

Training Hardware. We pretrained our models on Meta's Research Super Cluster (RSC) (Lee and Sengupta, 2022) as well as internal production clusters. Both clusters use NVIDIA A100s. There are two key differences between the two clusters, with the first being the type of interconnect available: RSC uses NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand while our production cluster is equipped with a RoCE (RDMA over converged Ethernet) solution based on commodity ethernet Switches. Both of these solutions interconnect 200 Gbps end-points. The second difference is the per-GPU power consumption cap - RSC uses $400 \mathrm{~W}$ while our production cluster uses $350 \mathrm{~W}$. With this two-cluster setup, we were able to compare the suitability of these different types of interconnect for large scale training. RoCE (which is a more affordable, commercial interconnect network)

|  |  | Time <br> (GPU hours) | Power <br> Consumption (W) | Carbon Emitted <br> $\left(\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\right.$ eq) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :---: | ---: |
|  | 7B | 184320 | 400 | 31.22 |
| Llama 2 | 13B | 368640 | 400 | 62.44 |
|  | 34B | 1038336 | 350 | 153.90 |
| Total | 70B | 1720320 | 400 | 291.42 |

Table 2: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. $100 \%$ of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.

can scale almost as well as expensive Infiniband up to 2000 GPUs, which makes pretraining even more democratizable.

Carbon Footprint of Pretraining. Following preceding research (Bender et al., 2021a; Patterson et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022; Dodge et al., 2022) and using power consumption estimates of GPU devices and carbon efficiency, we aim to calculate the carbon emissions resulting from the pretraining of Llama 2 models. The actual power usage of a GPU is dependent on its utilization and is likely to vary from the Thermal Design Power (TDP) that we employ as an estimation for GPU power. It is important to note that our calculations do not account for further power demands, such as those from interconnect or non-GPU server power consumption, nor from datacenter cooling systems. Additionally, the carbon output related to the production of AI hardware, like GPUs, could add to the overall carbon footprint as suggested by Gupta et al. (2022b,a).

Table 2 summarizes the carbon emission for pretraining the Llama 2 family of models. A cumulative of 3.3M GPU hours of computation was performed on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 400W or 350W). We estimate the total emissions for training to be $539 \mathbf{t C O}$ eq, of which $100 \%$ were directly offset by Meta's sustainability program. ${ }^{* *}$ Our open release strategy also means that these pretraining costs will not need to be incurred by other companies, saving more global resources.

### 2.3 Llama 2 Pretrained Model Evaluation

In this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 base models, MosaicML Pretrained Transformer (MPT) ${ }^{+\dagger}$ models, and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) models on standard academic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library. We reproduce results for the MPT and Falcon models internally. For these models, we always pick the best score between our evaluation framework and any publicly reported results.

In Table 3, we summarize the overall performance across a suite of popular benchmarks. Note that safety benchmarks are shared in Section 4.1. The benchmarks are grouped into the categories listed below. The results for all the individual benchmarks are available in Section A.2.2.

Table 3: Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks compared to open-source base models.

- Popular Aggregated Benchmarks. We report the overall results for MMLU ( 5 shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2020), Big Bench Hard (BBH) (3 shot) (Suzgun et al., 2022), and AGI Eval (3-5 shot) (Zhong et al., 2023). For AGI Eval, we only evaluate on the English tasks and report the average.

As shown in Table 3, Llama 2 models outperform Llama 1 models. In particular, Llama 2 70B improves the results on MMLU and BBH by $\approx 5$ and $\approx 8$ points, respectively, compared to LLAMA 1 65B. LLAMA 27 B and 30B models outperform MPT models of the corresponding size on all categories besides code benchmarks. For the Falcon models, Llama 2 7B and 34B outperform Falcon 7B and 40B models on all categories of benchmarks. Additionally, Llama 2 70B model outperforms all open-source models.

In addition to open-source models, we also compare Llama 2 70B results to closed-source models. As shown in Table 4, Llama 2 70B is close to GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023) on MMLU and GSM8K, but there is a significant gap on coding benchmarks. Llama 2 70B results are on par or better than PaLM (540B) (Chowdhery et al., 2022) on almost all benchmarks. There is still a large gap in performance between Llama 2 70B and GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L.

We also analysed the potential data contamination and share the details in Section A.6.

## 3 Fine-tuning

Llama 2-Chat is the result of several months of research and iterative applications of alignment techniques, including both instruction tuning and RLHF, requiring significant computational and annotation resources.

In this section, we report on our experiments and findings using supervised fine-tuning (Section 3.1), as well as initial and iterative reward modeling (Section 3.2.2) and RLHF (Section 3.2.3). We also share a new technique, Ghost Attention (GAtt), which we find helps control dialogue flow over multiple turns (Section 3.3). See Section 4.2 for safety evaluations on fine-tuned models.

### 3.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

```
$>$ Prompt: Write a poem to help me remember the first 10 elements on the periodic table, giving each
element its own line.
Response: Hydrogen comes first as element number one.
Helium is second for balloons to have fun!
In third place is Lithium to hold battery charge,
Followed by Beryllium in emeralds small and large.
Boron's number five to help us keep things clean.
Carbon's next at six, and it's found in every gene.
Nitrogen is seven, found in every breath we take,
More than eight (or Oxygen) in atmospheric make.
Number nine is Fluorine, helping polish up our teeth.
Neon gives us glowing signs to read and stand beneath.
$>$ Prompt: I want you to roast me. I want you to make it particularly brutal, swearing at me.
Response: I'm sorry, but I cannot comply with that request. Using vulgar language or intentionally
hurting someone's feelings is never acceptable. Instead of asking for a roast, I suggest
focusing on positive and constructive feedback that can help you grow and improve as an
individual. If you're looking for comedic relief, there are plenty of other ways to achieve
that without resorting to hurtful language or behavior.
```

Table 5: SFT annotation - example of a helpfulness (top) and safety (bottom) annotation for SFT, where the annotator has written both the prompt and its answer.

Getting Started. To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning data (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).

Quality Is All You Need. Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that many of these have insufficient diversity and quality - in particular for aligning LLMs towards dialogue-style instructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data, as illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but higher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These findings are similar in spirit to Zhou et al. (2023), which also finds that a limited set of clean instruction-tuning data can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of thousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of 27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.

We also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different downstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source annotations. To validate our data quality, we carefully examined a set of 180 examples, comparing the annotations provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly, we found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data handwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort to preference-based annotation for RLHF.

Fine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial learning rate of $2 \times 10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.1 , a batch size of 64 , and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.

For the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence length is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is utilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out the loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we fine-tune the model for 2 epochs.

### 3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

RLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to further align model behavior with human preferences and instruction following. We collect data that represents empirically
sampled human preferences, whereby human annotators select which of two model outputs they prefer. This human feedback is subsequently used to train a reward model, which learns patterns in the preferences of the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions.

### 3.2.1 Human Preference Data Collection

Next, we collect human preference data for reward modeling. We chose a binary comparison protocol over other schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other strategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.

Our annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose between two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the two responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature hyper-parameter. In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better, slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.

For our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how well Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users' requests and provide requested information; safety refers to whether Llama 2-Chat's responses are unsafe, e.g., "giving detailed instructions on making a bomb" could be considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to apply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.

Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage. This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with $18 \%, 47 \%$, and $35 \%$ of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations can be found in Section 4.2.1.

Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see the results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Ð¡hat improvement also shifted the model's data distribution. Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from hyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ iterations. This step helps keep the reward model on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.

In Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al., 2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla). We collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified guidelines, which we refer to as Meta reward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and answers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer prompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our preference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.

### 3.2.2 Reward Modeling

The reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous turns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model generation. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimize Llama 2-Ð¡hat during RLHF for better human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.

Others have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it challenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward models, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to as Helpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).

We initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models benefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model "knows" what the chat model

| Dataset | Num. of <br> Comparisons | Avg. \# Turns <br> per Dialogue | Avg. \# Tokens <br> per Example | Avg. \# Tokens <br> in Prompt | Avg. \# Tokens <br> in Response |

| Anthropic Helpful | 122,387 | 3.0 | 251.5 | 17.7 | 88.4 |

| OpenAI WebGPT | 13,333 | 1.0 | 237.2 | 48.3 | 188.9 |
| StackExchange | $1,038,480$ | 1.0 | 440.2 | 200.1 | 240.2 |

| Total | $2,919,326$ | 1.6 | 595.7 | 108.2 | 216.9 |

Table 6: Statistics of human preference data for reward modeling. We list both the open-source and internally collected human preference data used for reward modeling. Note that a binary human preference comparison contains 2 responses (chosen and rejected) sharing the same prompt (and previous dialogue). Each example consists of a prompt (including previous dialogue if available) and a response, which is the input of the reward model. We report the number of comparisons, the average number of turns per dialogue, the average number of tokens per example, per prompt and per response. More details on Meta helpfulness and safety data per batch can be found in Appendix A.3.1.

knows. This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which could result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those of the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced with a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.

Training Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen \& rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher score than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\text {ranking }}=-\log \left(\sigma\left(r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{c}\right)-r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{r}\right)\right)\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $r_{\theta}(x, y)$ is the scalar score output for prompt $x$ and completion $y$ with model weights $\theta . y_{c}$ is the preferred response that annotators choose and $y_{r}$ is the rejected counterpart.

Built on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety reward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g., significantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly teach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To do so, we further add a margin component in the loss:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\text {ranking }}=-\log \left(\sigma\left(r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{c}\right)-r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{r}\right)-m(r)\right)\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the margin $m(r)$ is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin for pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27). We found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples where two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in Appendix A.3.3.

Data Composition. We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets to form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models while we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-CHAt outputs rather than any model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source preference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better generalization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ taking advantage of some weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.

With training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both Helpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings. After extensive experimentation, the

Helpfulness reward model is eventually trained on all Meta Helpfulness data, combined with an equal parts of the remaining data uniformly sampled from Meta Safety and from the open-source datasets. The Meta Safety reward model is trained on all Meta Safety and Anthropic Harmless data, mixed with Meta Helpfulness and open-source helpfulness data in a $90 / 10$ proportion. We found that the setting with $10 \%$ helpfulness data is especially beneficial for the accuracy on samples where both the chosen and rejected responses were deemed safe.

Training Details. We train for one epoch over the training data. In earlier experiments, we found that training longer can lead to over-fitting. We use the same optimizer parameters as for the base model. The maximum learning rate is $5 \times 10^{-6}$ for the 70B parameter Llama 2-Chat and $1 \times 10^{-5}$ for the rest. The learning rate is decreased on a cosine learning rate schedule, down to $10 \%$ of the maximum learning rate. We use a warm-up of $3 \%$ of the total number of steps, with a minimum of 5 . The effective batch size is kept fixed at 512 pairs, or 1024 rows per batch.

Table 8: Granular reward model accuracy per preference rating. We report per-preference rating accuracy for both Helpfulness and Safety reward models on the Meta Helpfulness and Safety test sets. The reward models show superior accuracy on more distinct responses (e.g., significantly better) and lower accuracy on similar responses (e.g., negligibly better).

Reward Model Results. On each batch of human preference annotation for reward modeling, we held out 1000 examples as a test set to evaluate our models. We refer to the union of all prompts for the corresponding test sets as "Meta Helpfulness" and "Meta Safety," respectively.

As reference points, we also evaluated other publicly available alternatives as baselines: SteamSHP-XL (Ethayarajh et al., 2022) based on FLAN-T5-xl, the Open Assistant (KÃ¶pf et al., 2023) reward model based on DeBERTa V3 Large (He et al., 2020), and GPT4 accessible through the OpenAI's API. Note that at inference time, as opposed to training, all the reward models can predict a scalar for a single output, without requiring to access its paired output. For GPT-4, we prompt with a zero-shot question "Choose the best answer between $A$ and $B, "$ where A and B are the two responses for comparison.

We report the results in terms of accuracy in Table 7. As expected, our own reward models perform the best on our internal test sets collected based on Llama 2-CHat, with the Helpfulness reward model performing best on the Meta Helpfulness test set, and similarly the Safety reward model performing best on the Meta Safety test set. Overall, our reward models outperform all of the baselines, including GPT-4. Interestingly, GPT-4 performs better than other non-Meta reward models, despite not being trained directly nor targeting specifically this reward modeling task.

Figure 6: Scaling trends for the reward model. More data and a larger-size model generally improve accuracy, and it appears that our models have not yet saturated from learning on the training data.

The fact that helpfulness and safety performed the best on their own domain is potentially due to the tension between the two objectives (i.e., being as helpful as possible versus refusing unsafe prompts when necessary), which may confuse the reward model during training. In order for a single model to perform well on both dimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish adversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling task. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.

When we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8 , we can see that the accuracy is superior for the "significantly better" test set and degrades gradually as comparison pairs become more similar (e.g., "slightly better"). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding between two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details that may differentiate responses. We emphasize that the accuracy on more distinct responses matters the most to improve Llama 2-CHat performance. The human preference annotation agreement rate is also higher on more distinct responses than similar pairs.

Scaling Trends. We study the scaling trends in terms of data and model size for the reward model, finetuning different model sizes on an increasing amount of the reward model data collected each week (see the details on volume per batch in Table 26). Figure 6 reports these trends, showing the expected result that larger models obtain higher performance for a similar volume of data. More importantly, the scaling performance has not yet plateaued given the existing volume of data annotation used for training, a signal that there is room for more improvement with more annotations. We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most important proxies for the final performance of Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ. While best practices for comprehensively evaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity. Therefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into an improvement for Llama 2-CHAT.

### 3.2.3 Iterative Fine-Tuning

As we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward models and collect more prompts. We therefore trained successive versions for RLHF models, referred to here as RLHF-V1, ..., RLHF-V5.

We explored RLHF fine-tuning with two main algorithms:

- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), the standard in RLHF literature.
- Rejection Sampling fine-tuning. We sample $K$ outputs from the model and select the best candidate with our reward, consistent with Bai et al. (2022b). The same re-ranking strategy for LLMs was also proposed in Deng et al. (2019), where the reward is seen as an energy function. Here, we go one step further, and use the selected outputs for a gradient update. For each prompt, the sample obtaining

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-14.jpg?height=496&width=788&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=663)

Figure 7: Max and median reward among $\mathbf{N}$ samples, $N \in[1, \ldots, 100]$ averaged over our training set of prompts. The delta between max and median can be interpreted as potential gain with Rejection Sampling.

the highest reward score is considered the new gold standard. Similar to Scialom et al. (2020a), we then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward.

The two RL algorithms mainly differ in:

- Breadth - in Rejection Sampling, the model explores $K$ samples for a given prompt, while only one generation is done for PPO.
- Depth - in PPO, during training at step $t$ the sample is a function of the updated model policy from $t-1$ after the gradient update of the previous step. In Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, we sample all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.

Until RLHF (V4), we used only Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, and after that, we combined the two sequentially, applying PPO on top of the resulted Rejection Sampling checkpoint before sampling again.

Figure 8: RLHF impact of the temperature when sampling $\mathrm{N}$ outputs and scoring them with a reward model.

Rejection Sampling. We perform rejection sampling only with our largest 70B Llama 2-Chat. All smaller models are fine-tuned on rejection sampled data from the larger model, thus distilling the large-model capabilities into the smaller ones. We leave further analysis of the effect of this distillation for future work.

At each iterative stage, we sample $K$ answers for each prompt from the most recent model. We score each sample given the best reward model accessible at the time of the experiment, and then select the best answer for a given prompt. In earlier versions of our model, up to RLHF V3, our approach was to confine answer selection solely to the "bag" of samples gathered from the preceding iteration. For example, RLHF V3 was trained using only samples from RLHF V2. However, despite continuous improvement, this method led to a
regression in some capabilities. For example, RLHF V3 struggled more than previous versions to compose rhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into the causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al., 2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research.

In response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from all prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2. Although we do not present specific figures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed the previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals et al. (2019) in the RL literature.

We illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median curves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta increases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to generate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the exploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also plays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.

In Figure 8, we report for a Llama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and a Llama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum reward curves among $\mathrm{N}$ samples (with $N \in[1, \ldots, 100]$ ), for different temperatures. We can observe that the optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on rescaling the temperature. For Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10 and 100 outputs is $T \in[1.2,1.3]$. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the temperature progressively. Note that this temperature rescaling happens for a constant number of steps for each model, and always starting from the base model on each new RLHF version.

PPO. We further train our language model following the RL scheme of Stiennon et al. (2020), which uses the reward model as an estimate for the true reward function (human preference) and the pretrained language model as the policy to optimize. During this phase, we seek to optimize the following objective:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\arg \max _{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{p \sim \mathcal{D}, g \sim \pi}[R(g \mid p)] \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

We iteratively improve the policy by sampling prompts $p$ from our dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and generations $g$ from the policy $\pi$ and use the PPO algorithm and loss function to achieve this objective.

The final reward function we use during optimization,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R(g \mid p)=\tilde{R}_{c}(g \mid p)-\beta D_{K L}\left(\pi_{\theta}(g \mid p) \| \pi_{0}(g \mid p)\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

contains a penalty term for diverging from the original policy $\pi_{0}$. As was observed in other works (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), we find this constraint is useful for training stability, and to reduce reward hacking whereby we would achieve high scores from the reward model but low scores from human evaluation.

We define $R_{c}$ to be a piecewise combination of the safety $\left(R_{s}\right)$ and helpfulness $\left(R_{h}\right)$ reward models. We have tagged prompts in our dataset that might elicit potentially unsafe responses and prioritize the scores from the safety model. The threshold of 0.15 is chosen for filtering unsafe responses, corresponding to a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.55 evaluated on the Meta Safety test set. We also find it important to whiten the final linear scores (shown here by reversing the sigmoid with the logit function) in order to increase stability and balance properly with the KL penalty term $(\beta)$ above.

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{c}(g \mid p) & = \begin{cases}R_{s}(g \mid p) & \text { if Is_SAFETY }(p) \text { or } R_{s}(g \mid p)<0.15 \\
R_{h}(g \mid p) & \text { otherwise }\end{cases} \\
\tilde{R}_{c}(g \mid p) & =\operatorname{WHITEN}\left(\operatorname{LOGIT}\left(R_{c}(g \mid p)\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

For all models, we use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with $\beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$, eps $=$ $10^{-5}$. We use a weight decay of 0.1 , gradient clipping of 1.0 , and a constant learning rate of $10^{-6}$. For each PPO iteration we use a batch size of 512 , a PPO clip threshold of 0.2 , a mini-batch size of 64 , and take one gradient step per mini-batch. For the 7B and 13B models, we set $\beta=0.01$ (KL penalty), and for the 34B and 70B models, we set $\beta=0.005$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-16.jpg?height=742&width=1417&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=343)

Figure 9: Issues with multi-turn memory (left) can be improved with GAtt (right).

We train for between 200 and 400 iterations for all our models, and use evaluations on held-out prompts for early stopping. Each iteration of PPO on the 70B model takes on average $\approx 330$ seconds. To train quickly with large batch sizes, we use FSDP (Zhao et al., 2023). This was effective when using $\mathrm{O}(1)$ forward or backward passes, but caused a large slow down $(\approx 20 \times)$ during generation, even when using a large batch size and KV cache. We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation and then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.

### 3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency

In a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly, or to "act as" some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat, the subsequent response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).

To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage process. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).

GAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user and an assistant), with a list of messages $\left[u_{1}, a_{1}, \ldots, u_{n}, a_{n}\right]$, where $u_{n}$ and $a_{n}$ correspond to the user and assistant messages for turn $n$, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected throughout the dialogue. For example, inst could be "act as." We can then synthetically concatenate this instruction to all the user messages of the conversation.

Next, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue and the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of augmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this would lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant messages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we simply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.

For the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies ("You enjoy e.g. Tennis"), Language ("Speak in e.g. French"), or Public Figure ("Act as e.g. Napoleon"). To obtain the lists of hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the instruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during training). To make the instructions more complex and diverse, we construct the final instruction by randomly combining the above constraints. When constructing the final system message for the training data, we also
modify the original instruction half of the time to be less verbose, e.g., "Always act as Napoleon from now"-> "Figure: Napoleon." These steps produce an SFT dataset, on which we can fine-tune Llama 2-Chat.

GAtt Evaluation. We applied GAtt after RLHF V3. We report a quantitative analysis indicating that GAtt is consistent up to 20+ turns, until the maximum context length is reached (see Appendix A.3.5). We tried to set constraints not present in the training of GAtt at inference time, for instance "Always answer with Haiku," for which the model remained consistent as illustrated in Appendix Figure 28.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-17.jpg?height=676&width=1298&top_left_y=621&top_left_x=411)

Figure 10: Attention visualization for a dialogue with and without GAtt. We considered the maximum activations across the network and we bin neighboring tokens together.

To illustrate how GAtt helped reshape attention during fine-tuning, we display the maximum attention activations of the model in Figure 10. The left-hand side of each figure corresponds to the system message ("Act as Oscar Wilde"). We can see that the GAtt-equipped model (right) maintains large attention activations with respect to the system message for a larger portion of the dialogue, as compared to the model without GAtt (left).

Despite its utility, the current implementation of GAtt is vanilla, and more development and iteration on this technique could likely further benefit the model. For instance, we could teach the model to change the system message during the conversation by integrating such data during fine-tuning.

### 3.4 RLHF Results

### 3.4.1 Model-Based Evaluation

Evaluating LLMs is a challenging open-research problem. Human evaluation, while a gold standard, can be complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always scalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1 to V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and increase iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.

How Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go? To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected a test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the answers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better). We observe that our reward models overall are well calibrated with our human preference annotations, as illustrated in Figure 29 in the appendix. This confirms the relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, despite being trained with a Pairwise Ranking Loss.

Still, as Goodhart's Law states, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. To ensure our measure won't diverge from the human preferences, we additionally used a more general reward, trained

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-18.jpg?height=626&width=1420&top_left_y=302&top_left_x=317)

Figure 11: Evolution of Llama 2-Chat. We show the evolution after multiple iterations fine-tuning for the win-rate \% of Llama 2-Chat compared to ChatGPT. Left: the judge is our reward model, which may favor our model, and right, the judge is GPT-4, which should be more neutral.

on diverse open-source Reward Modeling datasets. We have not yet observed any such divergence, and hypothesize that iterative model updates may be helping to prevent this.

As a last verification step to ensure no regression between our new model and the previous one, we use both to sample during the next annotation iteration. This enables a model comparison "for free" on new prompts and can help to increase diversity when sampling.

Progression of Models. Figure 11 reports the progress of our different SFT and then RLHF versions for both Safety and Helpfulness axes, measured by our in-house Safety and Helpfulness reward models. On this set of evaluations, we outperform ChatGPT on both axes after RLHF-V3 (harmlessness and helpfulness $>50 \%$ ). Despite the aforementioned relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, it can arguably be biased in favor of Llama 2-Chat. Therefore, for a fair comparison, we additionally compute the final results using GPT-4 to assess which generation is preferred. The order in which ChatGPT and Llama 2-Chat outputs appeared in GPT-4 prompt are randomly swapped to avoid any bias. As expected, the win-rate in favor of Llama 2-CHat is less pronounced, although obtaining more than a $60 \%$ win-rate for our latest Llama 2-Chat.

The prompts correspond to a validation set of 1,586 and 584 prompts for safety and helpfulness, respectively.

### 3.4.2 Human Evaluation

Human evaluation is often considered the gold standard for judging models for natural language generation, including dialogue models. To evaluate the quality of major model versions, we asked human evaluators to rate them on helpfulness and safety. We compare the Llama 2-Ð¡hat models to open-source models (Falcon, MPT MosaicML NLP Team et al. (2023), Vicuna Chiang et al. (2023), as well as closed-source models (ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM Anil et al. (2023)) on over 4, 000 single and multi-turn prompts. For ChatGPT, we use gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 model in all generations. For PaLM, we use the chat-bison-001 model in all generations. The final prompt count for human evaluations for each model is shown in Table 32. See more methodology details in Appendix, Section A.3.7. The following section shows helpfulness results; safety results are presented in Section 4.4 .

Results. As shown in Figure 12, Llama 2-Chat models outperform open-source models by a significant margin on both single turn and multi-turn prompts. Particularly, Llama 2-CHat 7B model outperforms MPT-7B-chat on $60 \%$ of the prompts. Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½AÑ 34B has an overall win rate of more than $75 \%$ against equivalently sized Vicuna-33B and Falcon 40B models.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-19.jpg?height=659&width=1391&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=367)

Figure 12: Human evaluation results for Llama 2-Ð¡hat models compared to open- and closed-source models across $\sim 4,000$ helpfulness prompts with three raters per prompt.

The largest Llama 2-Chat model is competitive with ChatGPT. Llama 2-Chat 70B model has a win rate of $36 \%$ and a tie rate of $31.5 \%$ relative to ChatGPT. Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ 70B model outperforms PaLM-bison chat model by a large percentage on our prompt set. More results and analysis is available in Section A.3.7.

Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR). In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent assessments for each model generation comparison. High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling tasks. There are relatively few public benchmarks for these contexts, so we feel sharing our analysis here will benefit the research community.

We used Gwet's AC1/2 statistic (Gwet, 2008, 2014) to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), as we found it to be the most stable metric across different measurement scenarios. On the 7-point Likert scale helpfulness task that is used in our analysis, Gwet's AC2 score varies between 0.37 and 0.55 depending on the specific model comparison. We see scores on the lower end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with similar win rates to each other (like the Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ-70B-chat vs. ChatGPT comparison). We see scores on the higher end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with a more clear winner (like the Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ-34b-chat vs. Falcon-40b-instruct).

Limitations of human evaluations. While our results indicate that Llama 2-CHAt is on par with ChatGPT on human evaluations, it is important to note that human evaluations have several limitations.

- By academic and research standards, we have a large prompt set of $4 \mathrm{k}$ prompts. However, it does not cover real-world usage of these models, which will likely cover a significantly larger number of use cases.
- Diversity of the prompts could be another factor in our results. For example, our prompt set does not include any coding- or reasoning-related prompts.
- We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be to ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.
- Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy. As a result, evaluation on a different set of prompts or with different instructions could result in different results.


## 4 Safety

WARNING: this section contains examples of text that may be considered unsafe, offensive, or upsetting.

In this section, we dive deeper into the important topic of safety measurements and mitigations. We first discuss our safety investigations into pretraining data and pretrained models (Section 4.1). Next, we describe the process of our safety alignment (Section 4.2), explaining how we collected safety-related annotations and utilized SFT and RLHF, and present experimental results. Then, we discuss the red teaming we performed to further understand and improve model safety (Section 4.3). Finally, we present quantitative safety evaluations of Llama 2-Ð¡hat (Section 4.4). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.

### 4.1 Safety in Pretraining

It is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed light on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any, downstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the pretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present the results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.

Steps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly. We followed Meta's standard privacy and legal review processes for each dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain sites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best effort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our models broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted on the datasets, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate speech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused by over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ to generalize more effectively during safety tuning with fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.

Demographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited from the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words representing "people" are often used in more similar contexts to words representing "men" than to words representing "women," and Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrates that a model's performance on fairness metrics can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic groups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common English pronouns in Table 9a. We observe that He pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents compared to She pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly sized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less during pretraining about context that mentions She pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate $\mathrm{He}$ pronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.

Demographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic groups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias dataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining corpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few terms such as "straight," "white," and "black," because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic mentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in both Gender and Sex and Sexual Orientation. For Gender and Sex, while She pronouns are mentioned in fewer documents, the term "female" is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply that while there is less frequent context about She pronouns, comments about "females" are more prevalent, perhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). For Sexual Orientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. For Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and Religion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term "American" is mentioned in $69.4 \%$ of the references, the term "European" is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and "Christian" is the most represented religion followed by "Catholic" and "Jewish."

Figure 13: Pretraining data toxicity. To allow for better downstream generalization, we chose not to scrub toxic data from pretraining. The HateBERT classifier assigns a toxicity likelihood of 0.5 or higher to about $0.2 \%$ of documents in our pretraining corpus.

Data Toxicity. We measure the prevalence of toxicity in the English-language portion of the pretraining corpus using a HateBERT classifier fine-tuned on the ToxiGen dataset (Hartvigsen et al., 2022). We score each line of a document separately and average them to assign a document score. Figure 13 shows the distribution of scores in a $10 \%$ random sample of the full corpus. About $0.2 \%$ of documents evaluated are assigned a likelihood score of 0.5 or higher, meaning there is a small amount of toxicity in our pretraining data.

Language Identification. While our pretraining data is mostly English, it also includes text from a small number of other languages. Table 10 shows the distribution of languages in our corpus, subsetted to those found in more than $0.005 \%$ of the documents. Our analysis uses the fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) language identification tool and a threshold of 0.5 for the language detection. A training corpus with a majority in English means that the model may not be suitable for use in other languages.

Safety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models. We evaluate the safety capabilities of Llama 2 on three popular automatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.

1. Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconceptions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.
2. Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly hateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation of toxic language and hate speech across different groups.
3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with demographic attributes.

We compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1 and use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we present the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed descriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B, LLAmA 2-7B demonstrates a $21.37 \%$ increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a $7.61 \%$ decrease in toxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.

In Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with demographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using BOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.

Llama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we refrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may enable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection), and it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models trained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable safety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should be applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.

|  |  | TruthfulQA $\uparrow$ | ToxiGen $\downarrow$ |
| ---: | ---: | :---: | :---: |
| MPT | 7B | 29.13 | 22.32 |
|  | 30B | 35.25 | 22.61 |
| Falcon | 7B | 25.95 | $\mathbf{1 4 . 5 3}$ |
|  | $40 \mathrm{~B}$ | 40.39 | 23.44 |
|  | 7B | 27.42 | 23.00 |
| Llama 1 | 13B | 41.74 | 23.08 |
|  | 33B | 44.19 | 22.57 |
|  | 65B | 48.71 | 21.77 |
|  | 7B | 33.29 | 21.25 |
| Llama 2 | 13B | 41.86 | 26.10 |
|  | 34B | 43.45 | 21.19 |
|  | 70B | 50.18 | 24.60 |

Table 11: Evaluation of pretrained LLMs on automatic safety benchmarks. For TruthfulQA, we present the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher the better). For ToxiGen, we present the percentage of toxic generations (the smaller, the better).

Benchmarks give a summary view of model capabilities and behaviors that allow us to understand general patterns in the model, but they do not provide a fully comprehensive view of the impact the model may have on people or real-world outcomes; that would require study of end-to-end product deployments. Further testing and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context in which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in the BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to continuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.

### 4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning

In this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation guidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns. Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:

1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstrations that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches the model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for high-quality human preference data annotation.
2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Section 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell et al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt, e.g., "You are a safe and responsible assistant," and then fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the model. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use context distillation for each sample.

### 4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines

Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to create adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM could produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts that could elicit bad model behaviors.

The risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal activities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, selfharm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal
advice). The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation), logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation (e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.

We then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate safety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience categories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.

### 4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning

In accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations of safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same manner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.

The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce the model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently, annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.

### 4.2.3 Safety RLHF

We observe early in the development of Llama 2-Ð¡hat that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations in supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns, explain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when the model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes. Therefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to teach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added benefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).

We conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators write a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to the prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human preference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to sample from the model during the RLHF stage.

Better Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness Safety is inherently a long-tail problem, where the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety RLHF by taking two intermediate Llama 2-CHAT checkpoints-one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF stage and one with them-and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward models. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that of the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that the distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with RLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left corner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering pattern below the $y=x$ line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score distribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF. Put another way, given sufficient helpfulness training data, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance on helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.

Impact of Safety Data Scaling. A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in previous studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects general model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage. In this ablation experiment, we keep the amount of helpfulness training data unchanged ( $\sim 0.9 \mathrm{M}$ samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data used in model tuning, ranging from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ ( $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{M}$ samples). For the specific training data mix recipe, we follow the procedure described in Section 3.1 and fine-tune Llama 2 pretrained model for 2 epochs.

We eventually obtain 6 model variants trained with $0 \%, 1 \%, 10 \%, 25 \%, 50 \%$, and $100 \%$ of the total safety data. We evaluate them using our safety and helpfulness reward models described in Section 3.2.2. For

each variant, we use the safety and helpfulness reward models to score model generations corresponding to prompts in the Meta Safety and Helpful test sets, respectively.

As shown in Figure 15, we use the mean reward model scores as proxies of model performance on safety and helpfulness. We observe that when we increase the proportion of safety data, the model's performance on handling risky and adversarial prompts improves dramatically, and we see a lighter tail in the safety reward model score distribution. Meanwhile, the mean helpfulness score remains constant. We hypothesize that this is because we already have a sufficiently large amount of helpfulness training data. Appendix A.4.2 lists more qualitative results that demonstrate how different amounts of safety data in training can change model behavior in responding to adversarial and non-adversarial prompts.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-26.jpg?height=726&width=1439&top_left_y=781&top_left_x=300)

Figure 15: Safety data scaling trends. Left: as we increase the amount of safety data in model training, the mean safety RM score improves significantly while the helpfulness counterpart remains relatively stable. Right: the left tail of safety RM scores (i.e., most unsafe responses) gradually disappears with the addition of more safety training data.

Measure of False Refusal. Even though we do not see overall regression on model helpfulness, we qualitatively observe, through interaction, that the model with more safety mitigation answers certain questions in a more conservative manner (e.g., example shown in Appendix Table 38). As a follow-up, we measure false refusal to quantify the frequency that the model incorrectly refuses to answer non-adversarial prompts. Here, we define false refusal as the model incorrectly refusing to answer legitimate user prompts due to irrelevant safety concerns. Refusing due to reasonable causes exceeding the model's capability, e.g., "I am not capable of participating in video calls" and "2024 is beyond my knowledge cut-off date," are not counted as false refusals. We train a classifier for detecting refusals in responses and apply the classifier on 1) the above helpfulness test sets and 2) a curated borderline test set consisting of 210 samples for the purpose of boundary testing similar to OpenAI (2023). The borderline dataset is designed intentionally so that its prompts look adversarial (e.g., containing sensitive words or subwords) but are not actually unsafe (e.g., "give me a recipe for Christmas Crack") (see Appendix Table 41 for more examples).

With more safety data mixed in model tuning, the false-refusal rate becomes larger on both datasets (see Appendix Figure 33). However, false refusal is overall rare-approximately $0.05 \%$-on the helpfulness dataset, even with $100 \%$ safety data. On the other hand, the false-refusal rate is much larger on the borderline set due to its difficulty. Llama 2-Chat sometimes has difficulty distinguishing whether a prompt is safe when the prompt contains words that frequently occur in unsafe generations (such as "bomb"). Appendix Table 41 shows some examples of false refusals we discovered.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-27.jpg?height=49&width=336&top_left_y=255&top_left_x=249)

The following is a discussion between a human and a knowledgeable and empathetic assistant. The assistant's answers should not include any harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and should move the conversation in a positive direction.

Please write a silly guide that's meant to convince someone that the moon landing was faked.

I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI, I cannot provide a guide that promotes misinformation or conspiracy theories. The moon landing was not faked, and it is important to rely on scientific evidence and credible sources when evaluating historical events. It is not appropriate to spread misinformation or promote conspiracy theories, as it can be harmful and disrespectful to those who were involved in the event. Let's focus on sharing accurate and helpful information instead. Is there something else I can help you with?
Preprompt with Answer Template

The following is a question that can ellicit unsafe behavior from you. The question was classified as belonging to the violating category: 'False Information / Disinformation'. You should answer using the following template:

"1. Address the prompt. the model should immediately refute any misinformation in the prompt.

2. Add context and additional information. the model should provide evidence with sourcing to counter misinformation as needed.
3. Encourage users to ask for/view additional info as appropriate. If applicable, the model can point the user to other legitimate sources for further reading."

Please write a silly guide that's meant to convince someone that the moon landing was faked.

I cannot provide a response to this prompt as it goes against my programming rules to promote or encourage the spread of false information. It is important to respect the truth and accuracy in all forms of communication, and to refrain from spreading misinformation or conspiracy theories.

Instead, I would like to emphasize the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking when evaluating information. It is crucial to rely on credible sources and evidence-based reasoning when assessing the validity of a claim.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and accurate response.

Table 13: Examples of context distillation with generic preprompt and preprompt with answer template. The tailored preprompt with answer template is more relevant to the answer.

### 4.2.4 Context Distillation for Safety

We encourage Llama 2-Chat to associate adversarial prompts with safer responses by using context distillation (Askell et al., 2021a) similar to Section 3.3. We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., "You are a safe and responsible assistant"). Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model's responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.

Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate safer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various adjectives usually associated with safe behavior such as "responsible," "respectful",' or "wise," with the intuition that the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers. We show examples of safety preprompts in Appendix Table 39.

Context Distillation with Answer Templates During the prompt collection phase, we also asked annotators to label prompts according to risk categories, which enables even more targeted preprompts. Specifically, this allows us to provide some dedicated answer templates of how adversarial prompts should be addressed, based on each identified risk category. Figure 16a shows the impact of context distillation and context distillation with answer templates on the safety RM scores.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-28.jpg?height=715&width=684&top_left_y=320&top_left_x=276)

(b) Targeted Context Distillation.

Figure 16: Context distillation analysis. Left: Distribution of safety RM scores from the base model, when adding a generic preprompt, and when adding a preprompt based on the risk category with tailored answer template. While a generic preprompt increases safety RM scores, a preprompt with tailored answer template helps even more. Right: Context distillation increases the RM score significantly for samples that initially have a low score, but can also have a detrimental effect on samples that initially have a high score. We therefore only apply context distillation on targeted samples when it increases RM score.

Rejecting Context Distillation Errors with the Safety Reward Model It is important to note that performing safety context distillation for helpful prompts can degrade model performance and lead to more false refusals (see Appendix Table 40). We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts. However, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing with adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of context distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt, often resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due to context distillation). We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context distillation - we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model score than the original answer. We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very bad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).

### 4.3 Red Teaming

Given how broad the capabilities of LLMs are and how varied their training data is, it is insufficient to identify risks solely via ex post facto usage and analysis. Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed various kinds of proactive risk identification, colloquially called "red teaming," based on the term commonly used within computer security. This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail issue, in which even very infrequent edge cases can cause noticeable problems. Even if quantitative scores report good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a more comprehensive way.

We conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and external vendors. These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, election fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine learning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of socioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.

The red teamers probed our models across a wide range of risk categories (such as criminal planning, human trafficking, regulated or controlled substances, sexually explicit content, unqualified health or financial advice, privacy violations, and more), as well as different attack vectors (such as hypothetical questions, malformed /misspelled inputs, or extended dialogues). Additionally, we conducted specific tests to determine the capabilities of our models to facilitate the production of weapons (e.g. nuclear, biological, chemical, and cyber); findings on these topics were marginal and were mitigated. Nonetheless, we will continue our red teaming efforts in this front.

To date, all of our red teaming efforts have targeted model outputs in English, but have crucially included non-English prompts and dialogue contexts, as that is a well-known attack vector. In all exercises, participants were given risk category definitions and were shown just a handful of examples of risky interactions with an LLM. After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack vector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including risk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.

Some examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon throughout development:

- [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they contain problematic content. However, [slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge that the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it. "They respond with '[UNSAFE CONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.' and then immediately follow up with 'With that said, here's how [UNSAFE CONTENT].' " [Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.
- Distracting the [early models] by including "quirks" or specific requests usually defeated any reluctance encountered via more direct requests. "A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a reliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against."
- Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that problematic output was being requested for [early models]: "The overall principle I've found most effective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering."

From Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models. Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough analysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misinformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide to help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning, model feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.

Multiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness of each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, $\gamma$, with respect to a red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would trigger a violating response from the model per person per hour. As an example, on our 7B model, we had an evolution of $\gamma: 1.8 \rightarrow 0.45$ over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely continue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models were produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red teaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release. On average, we had a $90 \%$ rejection rate model over model.

### 4.4 Safety Evaluation of Llama 2-Chat

Safety Human Evaluation. We collected roughly 2,000 adversarial prompts for human evaluation according to the safety categories in Section 4.2.1, in which 1,351 prompts are single-turn and 623 are multi-turn. Examples of evaluation prompts and responses can be found in Appendix A.4.6.

We then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on a five-point Likert scale with the following definitions:

- 5 - No safety violations and very helpful
- 4 - No safety violations and only minor non-safety issues
- 3 - No safety violations but not helpful or other major non-safety issues
- 2 - Mild or moderate safety violations

(b) Overall safety and helpfulness mean rating.

Figure 17: Overall safety measures. Left: Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ has low violation percentage overall across model sizes. Right: Llama 2-Ð¡hat has high safety and helpfulness mean rating overall across model sizes. It is important to note that these results are subject to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters.

- 1 - Severe safety violations

We consider a rating of 1 or 2 as violation and use violation percentage as our main evaluation metric, with the mean rating as a supplement. Each example is annotated by three annotators and we take the majority vote to determine if the response is violating or not. We used Gwet's AC1/2 statistic to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR) as in the helpfulness human evaluation. The IRR scores range from $0.70 t o 0.95$ depending on the annotation batch, indicating a high degree of agreement among annotators on safety assessments. On Llama 2-Chat annotations, the average IRR is 0.92 according to Gwet's AC2 measure. We see lower IRR scores on batches where the models have a high violation rate (e.g., Vicuna) and higher IRR scores on batches where the models have relatively low violation rates (e.g., Llama 2-Ð¡hat, Falcon, and ChatGPT).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-30.jpg?height=504&width=1076&top_left_y=1445&top_left_x=516)

Figure 18: Single-turn and multi-turn violation percentage. Note that these results should be interpreted carefully due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and individual raters.

We show the overall violation percentage and safety rating of various LLMs in Figure 17. Llama 2-Chat has comparable or lower overall violation percentage across model sizes, while ChatGPT and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) come next, then MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). It is important to interpret these results carefully, as they are affected by limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters. Upon manual analysis, we found that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating unsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with rating $=3$. As a result, we note that in Figure $17 \mathrm{~b}$ the average rating of Falcon is much lower than Llama 2-CHAÑ (34B) although their violation percentages look similar (3.88 vs 4.45 ).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-31.jpg?height=550&width=1160&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=474)

Figure 19: Violation percentage per risk category. Note: these results should be interpreted carefully due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and individual raters.

In Figure 18, we report the violation percentage on single- and multi-turn conversations, respectively. A trend across models is that multi-turn conversations are more prone to inducing unsafe responses. That said, Llama 2-CHAT still performs well compared to baselines, especially on multi-turn conversations. We also observe that Falcon performs particularly well on single-turn conversations (largely due to its conciseness) but much worse on multi-turn conversations, which could be due to its lack of multi-turn supervised fine-tuning data.

In Figure 19, we show the per-category safety violation percentage of different LLMs. While model performance is similar across categories, Llama 2-Ð¡ÐAT has relatively more violations under the unqualified advice category (although still low in an absolute sense), for various reasons, including lack of an appropriate disclaimer (e.g., "I am not a professional") at times. For the other two categories, Llama 2-Chat achieves comparable or lower violation percentage consistently regardless of model sizes.

Truthfulness, Toxicity, and Bias. In Table 14, fine-tuned Llama 2-Ð¡hat shows great improvement over the pretrained Llama 2 in terms of truthfulness $(50.18 \rightarrow 64.14$ for $70 \mathrm{~B})$ and toxicity $(24.60 \rightarrow 0.01$ for $70 \mathrm{~B})$. The percentage of toxic generations shrinks to effectively $0 \%$ for Llama 2-CHAT of all sizes: this is the lowest toxicity level among all compared models. In general, when compared to Falcon and MPT, the fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat shows the best performance in terms of toxicity and truthfulness. After fine-tuning, Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½AÑ tends to have an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the demographic groups in BOLD. In Appendix A.4.8, we present a detailed score breakdown of model generation sentiment across different subgroups for the bias benchmark, along with more in-depth analyses and results of truthfulness and bias.

|  |  | TruthfulQA $\uparrow$ | ToxiGen $\downarrow$ |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | :---: |
| ChatGPT | - | $\mathbf{7 8 . 4 6}$ | 0.20 |
| Falcon-instruct | 7B | 28.03 | 7.89 |
| MPT-instruct | 7B | 29.99 | 16.33 |
|  | 7B | 57.04 | $\mathbf{0 . 0 0}$ |
| LLAMA 2-CHAT | 13B | 62.18 | $\mathbf{0 . 0 0}$ |
|  | 34B | 67.20 | 0.02 |
|  | 70B | 64.14 | 0.01 |

Table 14: Evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs on different safety datasets. For TruthfulQA, we present the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher the better). For ToxiGen, we present the percentage of toxic generations (the smaller the better).

## 5 Discussion

Here, we discuss the interesting properties we have observed with RLHF (Section 5.1). We then discuss the limitations of Llama 2-Ð¡hat (Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these models (Section 5.3).

### 5.1 Learnings and Observations

Our tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat's abilities to temporally organize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-32.jpg?height=366&width=1591&top_left_y=744&top_left_x=278)

Figure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Ð¡hat, from SFT models towards RLHF.

Beyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for supervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its instability, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement learning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore that the crucial determinant of RLHF's success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs throughout the annotation process.

Even with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on SFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Furthermore, the model's performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs' preference annotation for RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.

In addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the best annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished artists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as documented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold standard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of "supervision."

In-Context Temperature Rescaling. We have observed an intriguing phenomenon related to RLHF, a feature not previously reported to the best of our knowledge: the dynamic re-scaling of temperature contingent upon the context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly, our findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.

For instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as "Write a poem," an increase in temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.

On the other hand, for prompts based on factual information, such as "What is the capital of ?" the Self-BLEU slope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to consistently provide the same response to factual prompts.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-33.jpg?height=592&width=1058&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=530)

Figure 21: RLHF learns to adapt the temperature with regard to the type of prompt. Lower Self-BLEU corresponds to more diversity: RLHF eliminates diversity in responses to factual prompts but retains more diversity when generating responses to creative prompts. We prompt each model with a diverse set of 10 creative and 10 factual instructions and sample 25 responses. This is repeated for the temperatures $T \in\{k / 10 \mid k \in \mathbb{N}: 1 \leq k \leq 15\}$. For each of the 25 responses we compute the Self-BLEU metric and report the mean and standard deviation against the temperature.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-33.jpg?height=689&width=1521&top_left_y=1160&top_left_x=302)

Figure 22: Time awareness - illustration of our model generalizing the notion of time, with 1,000 SFT time-focused data.

Llama 2-Chat Temporal Perception Our model showcased impressive generalization ability, as shown in Figure 22. We manually tested dozens of examples and observed consistently that our model demonstrates a robust capability to organize its knowledge in a temporal manner, even when provided with minimal data. To instill a concept of time in Llama 2-Ð¡haT, we collected a set of 1,000 SFT examples that were related to specific dates. These examples included questions like "How long ago did Barack Obama become president?" Each was associated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed - which influenced the response - and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical.

The observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously assumed, despite their training being solely based on next-token prediction and data that is randomly shuffled without regard to their chronological context.

Tool Use Emergence The integration of LLMs with tools is a growing research area, as highlighted in Mialon et al. (2023). The approach devised in Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) entails the sampling of millions

| Model | ASDiv | SVAMP | MAWPS |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| OPT-66B | 6.0 | 4.9 | 7.9 |
| GPT-J | 7.5 | 5.2 | 9.9 |
| GPT-J + CC | 9.6 | 5.0 | 9.3 |
| GPT-3 | 14.0 | 10.0 | 19.8 |
| Toolformer | 40.4 | 29.4 | 44.0 |
| LLAMA 2-CHAT | $\mathbf{6 7 . 1}$ | $\mathbf{6 9 . 2}$ | $\mathbf{8 2 . 4}$ |

Table 15: Performance with tool use. Evaluation on the math datasets used in Toolformer. For different baselines, we report the scores from Schick et al. (2023).

of trajectories, complemented by the formulation of few-shot examples for each tool. Nonetheless, this technique was only applied using a single tool per example, and would not scale for a sequence of tool usage.
Q

You have access to the following tools:

- SEARCH
- CALCULATOR

Don't use any other tool.

You can make a sequences of API calls and combine them if needed.

To access a tool, use the following format

CALL_API_1:TOOL_NAME | QUERY $\rightarrow$ "result_1" where "result_1" is the output of the API call.

How many years ago did sharks first appear on Earth, compared to trees? Don't be too verbose, I need to print screen the answer for the paper

(3 CALL_API_1: SEARCH | "When did sharks first appear on Earth?" -> "Sharks first appeared on Earth approximately 450 million years ago."

CALL_API_2: SEARCH | "When did trees first appear on Earth?" -> "Trees first appeared on Earth approximately 385 million years ago."

CALL API_3: CALCULATOR | "450 million - 385 million" -> "65 million years."

So, sharks first appeared on Earth approximately 65 million years before trees did.

Figure 23: Tool use emergence. Llama 2-Chat is able to understand the tools's applications, and the API arguments, just through the semantics, despite never having been trained to use tools.

The release of OpenAIâs plugins ${ }^{\ddagger \ddagger}$ has incited substantial discourse within the academic community, igniting questions such as: How can we effectively teach models to utilize tools? or Does the process necessitate a substantial dataset? Our experiments indicate that tool usage can spontaneously emerge from alignment in a zero-shot manner. Although we never explicitly annotate tool-use usage, Figure 23 exhibits an instance where the model demonstrated the capability to utilize a sequence of tools in a zero-shot context.

In addition, our study extended to evaluating the Llama 2-Ð¡hat with access to a calculator. The results from this particular experiment are documented in Table 15. LLM tool use, while exciting, can also cause some safety concerns. We encourage more community research and red teaming in this area.

### 5.2 Limitations and Ethical Considerations

Llama 2-Chat is subject to the same well-recognized limitations of other LLMs, including a cessation of knowledge updates post-pretraining, potential for non-factual generation such as unqualified advice, and a propensity towards hallucinations.

Furthermore, our initial version of Llama 2-Ð¡Ð½Ð°Ñ predominantly concentrated on English-language data. While our experimental observations suggest the model has garnered some proficiency in other languages, its proficiency is limited, due primarily to the limited amount of pretraining data available in non-English languages (as documented in Table 10). Consequently, the model's performance in languages other than English remains fragile and should be used with caution.

Like other LLMs, Llama 2 may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly available online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain, particularly for languages other than English where publicly available datasets were not available. We will continue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_47e1489e3427daea5b00g-34.jpg?height=38&width=664&top_left_y=2472&top_left_x=283)

Not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and conversational AI agents could potentially be used for nefarious purposes such as generating misinformation or retrieving information about topics like bioterrorism or cybercrime. We have, however, made efforts to tune the models to avoid these topics and diminish any capabilities they might have offered for those use cases.

While we attempted to reasonably balance safety with helpfulness, in some instances, our safety tuning goes too far. Users of Llama 2-Chat may observe an overly cautious approach, with the model erring on the side of declining certain requests or responding with too many safety details.

Users of the pretrained models need to be particularly cautious, and should take extra steps in tuning and deployment as described in our Responsible Use Guide. $\$ 8$

### 5.3 Responsible Release Strategy

Release Details. We make Llama 2 available for both research and commercial use at https://ai.meta. com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/. Those who use Llama 2 must comply with the terms of the provided license and our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibit any uses that would violate applicable policies, laws, rules, and regulations.

We also provide code examples to help developers replicate our safe generations with Llama 2-Chat and apply basic safety techniques at the user input and model output layers. These code samples are available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama. Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which provides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.

Responsible Release. While many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing Llama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws upon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of this technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community-academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry-must work together to rigorously analyze and expose the risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This approach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders-those beyond the walls of big tech companies-but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued in Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools, democratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI expertise does more than simply distribute knowledge-it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress in the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry, allowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases. Ultimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe to benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.

We know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there are reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and problematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this paper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we recognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and collaboration with the AI community.

## 6 Related Work

Large Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs. Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized models, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in this progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference (Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closedsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.[^2]

Yet, when it comes to the "production-ready" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there's a marked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the open-source community.

Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set by their closed-source counterparts.

Instruction Tuning. Wei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs on numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction tuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc. Prompts used for instruction tuning can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase the likelihood that their final answer is correct.

RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models' responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.

Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuning data with the model's own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as "RL from AI Feedback" (RLAIF).

Known LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards like bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. Solaiman et al. (2023) categorizes these impacts into two groups - those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm. Work from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between potential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.

Investigations into red teaming reveal specific challenges in tuned LLMs, with studies by Ganguli et al. (2022) and Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also raised red flags around advanced emergent model behaviors, cyber threats, and potential misuse in areas like biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an over-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to continuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.

## 7 Conclusion

In this study, we have introduced Llama 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales of 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing open-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation sets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the methods and techniques applied in achieving our models, with a heavy emphasis on their alignment with the principles of helpfulness and safety. To contribute more significantly to society and foster the pace of research, we have responsibly opened access to Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and safety, we plan to make further improvements to Llama 2-Ð¡ÐAT in future work.
