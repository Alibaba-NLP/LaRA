#### Abstract

We introduce "Idea to Image," a system that enables multimodal iterative self-refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for automatic image design and generation. Humans can quickly identify the characteristics of different text-to-image (T2I) models via iterative explorations. This enables them to efficiently convert their high-level generation ideas into effective T2I prompts that can produce good images. We investigate if systems based on large multimodal models (LMMs) can develop analogous multimodal self-refinement abilities that enable exploring unknown models or environments via self-refining tries. Idea2Img cyclically generates revised T2I prompts to synthesize draft images, and provides directional feedback for prompt revision, both conditioned on its memory of the probed T2I model's characteristics. The iterative self-refinement brings Idea2Img various advantages over vanilla T2I models. Notably, Idea2Img can process input ideas with interleaved image-text sequences, follow ideas with design instructions, and generate images of better semantic and visual qualities. The user preference study validates the efficacy of multimodal iterative selfrefinement on automatic image design and generation.


## 1. Introduction

"Image design and generation" aims to create an image from a high-level user idea. This input IDEA can contain interleaved reference images, such as "the dog looks like the one in the image," or with instructional texts specifying the intended design usage, such as "a logo for the Idea2Img system." To convert IDEA into an image, humans may first draft detailed descriptions of the imagined image, and then use text-to-image (T2I) models [ $31,33,34,36,54]$ to gener-[^0]

Figure 1. Idea2Img framework enables LMMs to mimic humanlike exploration to use a T2I model, enabling the design and generation of an imagined image specified as a multimodal input IDEA. The iterative process involves LMMs functioning in different roles to refine the image creation. Specifically, LMMs will (1) generate and revise text prompts for the T2I model, (2) select the best draft images, and (3) provide feedback on the errors and revision directions. This multimodal iterative self-refinement process requires LMMs to memorize the T2I model's characteristics observed in previous iterations as humans and adjust T2I prompts accordingly.

ate the image. This manual process for users to search for an ideal detailed description (i.e., T2I prompt) that fits the T2I model typically involves iterative exploration $[44,58]$. As shown in Figure 1, humans may first design and draft an initial T2I prompt based on their imagined IDEA to generate. Then, they can obtain multiple draft images with a T2I model, select the most promising draft, write text feedback,

Figure 2. Overview of the image design and generation scenarios enabled by Idea2Img. In each sub-figure, the image and text in the left green box are the user input IDEA. The center image is the baseline results directly generated by the same T2I model with a human-written T2I prompt, and the image on the right is generated with the T2I prompt discovered by Idea2Img's iterative self-refinement exploration.

and further revise the T2I prompt. As this iteration progresses, we humans can swiftly grasp the characteristics of a specific T2I model, such as words that the model can not understand, finally producing a good image generated by a suitable T2I prompt. Given the remarkable capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) [13, 26, 48], we explore if we can build systems based on LMMs to develop similar iterative self-refinement ability, thereby relieving humans from the tedious process of converting ideas to images.

Iterative self-refinement is one intrinsic ability humans possess when exploring unknown environments and solving complicated problems. Large language models (LLMs) agent systems $[9,23,40]$ have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-refinement in better addressing natural language
processing tasks, such as acronym generation, sentiment retrieval, text-based environment exploration, etc. Transitioning from text-only tasks to multimodal environments poses new challenges of improving, assessing, and verifying multimodal contents, such as multiple interleaved image-text sequences. For example, when learning to use T2I models, LMMs need to improve the generation with revised T2I prompts, assess multiple images in detail to select the best draft, and verify the draft image with the multimodal IDEA to provide text feedback. These steps, each requiring different multimodal understanding capabilities, jointly enable the intriguing multimodal iterative self-refinement ability. Such an LMM framework can automatically learn to tackle various real-world problems [48] via self-exploration, such as navigating GUI to use electronic devices, exploring unknown physical environments via an embodied agent, engaging in electronic games, and so on. In this study, we focus on "image design and generation" as the task to study the multimodal iterative self-refinement ability.

To this end, we introduce Idea2Img, a multimodal iterative self-refinement framework for automatic image design and generation. As illustrated in Figure 1, Idea2Img involves an LMM, GPT-4V(ision) [1,26-28], interacting with a T2I model to probe its usage and find an effective T2I prompt. The LMM will act in different roles to analyze the return signal from the T2I model (i.e., draft images) and design the next round's queries (i.e., text T2I prompts). The three roles of generating T2I prompts, selecting draft images, and reflecting feedback together enable the multimodal iterative self-refinement ability. Specifically, (1) Prompt generation: GPT-4V generates $N$ text prompts that correspond to the input multimodal user IDEA, conditioned on the previous text feedback and refinement history; (2) Draft image selection: GPT-4V carefully compares $N$ draft images for the same IDEA and select the most promising one; (3) Feedback reflection: GPT-4V examines the discrepancy between the draft image and the IDEA. GPT-4V then provides feedback on what is incorrect, the plausible causes, and how T2I prompts may be revised to obtain a better image. Furthermore, Idea2Img is enhanced with a memory module that stores all prompt exploration histories, including previous draft images, text prompts, and feedback. The Idea2Img framework iterates among these three steps with GPT-4V for automatic image design and generation.

To users, Idea2Img functions as an enhanced image design and generation assistant. Compared with T2I models, Idea2Img can handle design instructions instead of requiring detailed image description, support the multimodal IDEA input, and generate images of better semantic and visual qualities. We overview representative image design and generation scenarios in Figure 2. For example, Idea2Img can incorporate the visual design and intended usage description in IDEA, extract arbitrary visual infor- mation from the input image, and process IDEA with arbitrarily interleaved image-text sequences. Built upon these new functionalities and scenarios of interest, we develop an evaluation IDEA set with 104 samples, containing complicated queries that humans may fail in their first trials. We perform user preference studies on Idea2Img with different T2I models. The consistent user preference score improvements on different image generation models, e.g., $+26.9 \%$ with SDXL [31], indicate the effectiveness of Idea2Img in image design and generation.

Our contributions are summarized as follows.

- We study "automatic image design and generation," which aims to create an image from an input IDEA. This high-level idea may contain interleaved reference images, and instructional texts for intended designs.
- We explore the multimodal iterative self-refinement ability in GPT-4V-based systems, showcasing its effectiveness in improving, assessing, and verifying multimodal contents.
- We propose Idea2Img, a multimodal iterative selfrefinement framework that enhances any T2I model for image design and generation, enabling various new image creation functionalities with better image qualities.
- We present an evaluation set with 104 challenging multimodal IDEA. The consistent user preference score gains, when experimented on different image generation models, indicate Idea2Img's effectiveness in automatic image design and generation.


## 2. Related Work

LLM-based self-refinement. Idea2Img is inspired by the effectiveness of iterative self-refinement in LMM-based agent systems [23,29, 40] in exploring unknown environments and tasks, built upon the successful LLM agents [14, 30,32,37,47, 52, 57]. Self-refine [23] takes the same LLM to iteratively critique its outputs, and leverage this feedback to enhance its predictions. This framework shows effectiveness across various NLP tasks, including sentiment reversal, dialogue response, math reasoning, and more. Reflexion [40] explores a self-reflective LLM system on the text-based environment exploration task [41] and multi-hop QA [50]. Despite the success, LLM-based self-refinement naturally can not understand multimodal inputs. Consequently, the explored tasks and environments are limited to the natural language description, such as AlfWorld [41]. Idea2Img delves into the potential of an LMM-based iterative self-refinement system for multimodal environment exploration, from a simple T2I model to other more complicated environments.

Multimodal agents. Our Idea2Img is related to multimodal agents [15,20,22,38,43,45,49,55] that chain external tools
such as T2I or vision-language models with LLMs for multimodal tasks. For instance, MM-ReAct [49] integrates an LLM with multiple vision tools for multimodal reasoning and action, enabling it to solve various complicated visual understanding tasks, ranging from multi-hop document reasoning to open-world video interpretation. Visual ChatGPT [45] empowers ChatGPT to allocate various image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion [34], img2img model [24], ControlNet [56], enabling multi-step visual editing and generation. The primary difference between Idea2Img and existing multimodal agent studies [45,49] lies in the approach to understand the tool usage. Existing studies assume the knowledge of how to use each tool, and provide such information to LLMs via text instructions or incontext examples. In contrast, the optimal usage of the tool remains unknown in Idea2Img and requires iterative exploration. Another minor distinction is that Idea2Img utilizes LMMs instead of LLMs, thereby does not require general visual understanding tools such as a caption model [46].

Extensions of base T2I models. Idea2Img provides a more natural way for users to design and produce their desired visual content. This framework, which extends T2I models for new functionalities, is related to various works in improving base T2I models [31,33,34,36,54]. These studies include extending the base T2I model to better follow user prompts $[5,7,10,11]$, finding magic words in T2I prompts for better visual quality $[44,58]$, supporting extra image input for image manipulation $[6,16,17,24]$, style transfer [12], visual concept customization [3, 8, 18,35,39], and so on. While specialized T2I extensions can address a single specific functionality, Idea2Img offers a more unified and widely applicable framework. That is, a single Idea2Img framework can handle various generation scenarios, ranging from style transfer to attribute customization, without requiring separate models or task-specific model design and finetune. More importantly, Idea2Img effectively collaborates with those enhanced generative models, consistently improving them by exploring suitable text prompts.

## 3. Idea2Img Framework

Figure 3 illustrates the Idea2Img framework. Idea2Img framework involves two core pre-trained models, i.e., the GPT-4V(ision) as the LMM $\mathcal{M}$ and a T2I model $^{2}$ to explore $\mathcal{G}$. Idea2Img also contains a memory $m$ that stores insights on $\mathcal{G}$ discovered by $\mathcal{M}$ during previous iterations.

Execution flow. We begin with an overview of the key steps in $\mathcal{M}$ iteratively exploring the use of $\mathcal{G}$. Starting from the top-left of Figure 3, "initial prompt generation" converts the input multimodal user IDEA into T2I text prompts, later producing multiple draft images with T2I model $\mathcal{G}$. "Draft[^1]

image selection" then selects the best draft image among them for the current iteration. The selected image is either output as the final prediction or continues for further refinement, depending on the stop condition. For the latter, "feedback reflection" compares the current best draft image with the multimodal IDEA, and summarizes the major discrepancy as text feedback. With the iteration history and text feedback, "revised prompt generation" then drafts revised T2I prompts and continues the iterative self-refinement with the new set of draft images.

(1) Initial prompt generation. This step generates $N$ initial T2I prompts $\left\{y_{0}^{0}, \ldots, y_{0}^{N-1}\right\}$ following the input user IDEA $x$, by prompting $\mathcal{M}$ with LMM prompt $p_{g e n}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{y_{0}^{0}, \ldots, y_{0}^{N-1}\right\}=\mathcal{M}\left(x, p_{\text {gen }}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

The "initial prompt generation" requires $\mathcal{M}$ to understand the multimodal user IDEA $x$ and convert the design IDEA into descriptive T2I prompts that the T2I model could understand. LMM prompt $p_{g e n}$ is a zero-shot prompt without in-context examples.

With the "initial prompt generation" step, Idea2Img can understand user IDEA with interleaved image-text sequences, instead of the text-only T2I prompts containing the image description. Specifically, (1) IDEA can be a highlevel design or usage instead of the detailed image description, such as "a car image for a children's painting competition"; and (2) IDEA can take multiple images and use interleaved text instruction to extract arbitrary visual information of interest, including image style, visual entity, object attributes, etc. Then, in iteration $t=0$ as well as future iterations $t=t$, each T2I prompt $y_{t}^{n}$ is separately sent to the T2I model $\mathcal{G}$, resulting in $N$ draft images $i_{t}^{n}=\mathcal{G}\left(y_{t}^{n}\right), n=0, \ldots, N-1$.

(2) Draft image selection. With the $N$ draft images in iteration $t$, "draft image selection" selects the best draft image $i_{t}^{*}$ by prompting $\mathcal{M}$ with LMM prompt $p_{\text {select }}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{t}^{*}=\mathcal{M}\left(i_{t}^{0}, \ldots, i_{t}^{N-1}, x, p_{\text {select }}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

The design of a "draft image selection" step is motivated by the observation that T2I models could generate bad images with good prompts. This step is designed to filter out low-quality images, and avoid the quality perturbation to dominate the iterative refinement.

The task of selecting the best image requires $\mathcal{M}$ to compare and grade both the semantics and visual quality of $N$ similar draft images. We find such a "spot the difference" task very challenging for LMMs, and only the very recent model [26] is capable of performing the selection reliably. Qualitative examples are shown in Figure 10.

(3) Feedback reflection. After obtaining the selected image $i_{t}^{*}$, the framework checks the stop condition, such as if

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_84622e890cb78b254827g-05.jpg?height=753&width=1726&top_left_y=255&top_left_x=167)

Figure 3. The framework overview of Idea2Img, which takes an LMM [26,27] to explore a T2I model via multimodal iterative selfrefinement, leading to an effective T2I prompt for the input user IDEA. The rounded rectangle shape indicates a GPT-4V call.

the current iteration $t$ exceeds the maximum $T$. Idea2Img then outputs $i_{t}^{*}$ as the output image or proceeds the refinement process to the "feedback reflection" step accordingly.

"Feedback reflection" aims to provide text feedback $f_{t}$ that describes the direction to improve for draft image $i_{t}^{*}$. The steps prompts $\mathcal{M}$ with LMM prompt $p_{f b}$, conditioned on the draft image $i_{t}^{*}$ and memory $m$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{t}=\mathcal{M}\left(i_{t}^{*}, m, x, p_{f b}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

"Feedback reflection" takes $\mathcal{M}$ to compare an image $i_{t}^{*}$ with the multimodal user IDEA $x$, and summarize the gap as text feedback $f_{t}$. The step not only requires $\mathcal{M}$ to identify the discrepancy between image $i_{t}^{*}$ and IDEA $x$, but also benefits from writing the major errors to make the iteration effective. In practice, we find it helpful to explicitly specify the aspects to check, such as style, entity, attributes, appearance, etc., via text instructions or in-context examples in LMM prompt $p_{f b}$. Furthermore, we add text instructions to $p_{f b}$ to have $\mathcal{M}$ "focus on one thing to improve in each feedback," and "provide a high-level explanation of how to modify prompts to address the given feedback." Example feedback is shown in Figure 8.

(1) Revised prompt generation. Finally, "prompt generation" takes text feedback $f_{t}$ and memory $m$ to draft $N$ revised prompt $\left\{y_{t+1}^{0}, \ldots, y_{t+1}^{N-1}\right\}$, by prompting $\mathcal{M}$ with LMM prompt $p_{\text {revise }}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{y_{t+1}^{0}, \ldots, y_{t+1}^{N-1}\right\}=\mathcal{M}\left(f_{t}, m, x, p_{\text {revise }}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Generating revised prompts requires $\mathcal{M}$ to understand the property of $\mathcal{G}$ stored in memory $m$, thereby drafting new T2I prompts that could most likely address the issue identified in $f_{t}$. We empirically find Idea2Img generates
T2I prompts that work better for $\mathcal{G}$ during iterative selfrefinement, with examples shown in Figure 9.

Memory module. Memory $m$ is one important design in Idea2Img. $m$ has the format of interleaved image-text sequences that store all previous iterations' feedback, selected draft image, and the corresponding text prompts:

$$
\begin{equation*}
m_{t}=\left[y_{0}^{*}, i_{0}^{*}, f_{0}, \ldots, y_{t-1}^{*}, i_{t-1}^{*}, f_{t-1}\right] \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

It allows LMM $\mathcal{M}$ to understand the properties and capabilities of the T2I model $\mathcal{G}$ in use, such as a keyword that $\mathcal{G}$ may not understand or a complicated scene that $\mathcal{G}$ fail to generate, and incorporate such knowledge in generating the revised T2I prompts $y$. For example, it may describe the appearance of a yoga pose in detail, instead of only mentioning the pose name in $y$. Examples are shown in Figures 5-7, when comparing initial and refined $\mathrm{T} 2 \mathrm{I}$ prompts $y_{0}$ and $y_{T}$.

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1. Experiment Settings

Compared model variants. We mainly compare the following three models in image generation.

- "Initial-round manual prompt" is the baseline T2I prompt written by humans with minor prompt engineering. It serves as the baseline of a T2I prompt that merely contains key information in IDEA.
- "Initial-round Idea2Img prompt" is the LMMgenerated T2I prompt in the initial round. Specifically, the max iteration $T=1$, and LMM $\mathcal{M}$ is only used for initial prompt generation and draft image selection, but not feedback reflection nor revised prompt

generation. This Idea2Img variant is used to ablate Idea2Img's gain from prompt generation and selection, $v s$. the further iterative refinement.

- "Iterative self-refined Idea2Img prompt" is complete Idea2Img pipeline with the max iteration $T=3$.

Evaluation samples and metrics. For the quantitative evaluation, we collect a dataset of 104 user IDEA as input queries. Among them, 33 queries contain text only, 43 queries contain an image-text sequence with a single image, and the remaining 28 contains a sequence with two or more images. The text in most IDEA contains not only descriptive content text that describes the scene to generate, but also instructional text such as "a logo for commercial advertising" or "generate the pointed dog in the blue color." All test queries are manually composed.

We then perform the user preference study as the main quantitative metric. Users are presented with the IDEA and multiple images to select the best one for each IDEA. The evaluation script automatically shuffles the order during evaluation to prevent the influence of image orders.

Experimented T2I models. We experiment Idea2Img on a wide variety of T2I model $\mathcal{G}$ with diverse model capacities and functionalities. Specifically, we study Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 [34], SD v2.1, SDXL v1.0 with refiner [31], and DeepFloyd IF (IF-I-XL and IF-II-L) [19]. Other than T2I models, we also consider the img2img pipeline (i.e., SDEdit [24]) for SDXL and DeepFloyd IF, as a demonstration of using Idea2Img for the text-conditioned image-toimage generation. The default strength $t_{0}$ in the img2img pipeline is 1.00. SDXL-img2img and IF-img2img are the same as SDXL and IF (i.e., T2I) when IDEA contains text only, and condition on the first image with IDEA contains multiple images. LMM prompts $p_{\text {gen }}, p_{\text {select }}, p_{f b}, p_{\text {revise }}$ are kept the same for all experimented T2I models.

### 4.2. Image Generation Results

User preference evaluation. Table 1 compares the user preference when selecting from the three images generated by "initial-round manual prompt," "initial-round Idea2Img prompt," and "iterative self-refined Idea2Img prompt," using the same T2I model, for each user IDEA. Among T2I models with different model sizes and functionalities, Idea2Img leads to consistent improvements in user preference. The initial-round Idea2Img prompt already improves the initial-round manual prompt, by effectively un-

Figure 4. User preference scores among T2I models before and after iterative self-refinement. We observe that the initially favored T2I model, SDXL, benefits more from the Idea2Img iteration.

derstanding the multimodal user IDEA and selecting the best draft images. The full Idea2Img framework further improves from the initial-round Idea2 Img results with the multimodal iterative self-refinement. For example, when using SDXL v1.0, users prefer the images generated by Idea2Img $59 / 104=56.7 \%$ times, compared with the baseline of $14 / 104=13.5 \%$. Similar improvements are observed on all experimented T2I models, as shown in the bolded row of "iterative self-refined Idea2Img prompt."

Furthermore, we examine which T2I model benefits the most from the LMM iterative self-refinement. By comparing the $\Delta_{\text {iteration }}$ in Table 1 that represents the difference between first-round and iterative Idea2Img user preference, we observe that stronger T2I models tend to benefit more from LMM refinements. For example, SDXL and IF become more favored $26.9 \%$ and $16.3 \%$ times, compared with SD v2.1 and SD v1.5's $5.8 \%$ and $4.8 \%$. The trend that stronger T2I models benefit more from Idea2Img is also observed in Figure 4's analysis, where users pick their preferred image generated by different T2I models. After Idea2Img's iterative refinement, the initially favored model SDXL benefits more from the iteration, resulting in an even higher user preference rate. We conjecture that the better language understanding ability in stronger T2I models enables them to better follow revised T2I prompts. They also have a better image generation capability that makes it possible to generate challenging scenes, when given a good T2I prompt optimized by Idea2Img. We are eager to see how this trend evolves as we experiment with even stronger T2I models [2,25] in the future. Nonetheless, Idea2Img is effective across T2I models of varying capacities, consistently leading to a higher user preference score.

Figure 6 examines SDXL-img2img, a representative text-conditioned image-to-image model that adds noise to the input image and then performs textconditioned denoising [24]. Figure 7 contains the results of Idea2Img working with other image generation models.

Idea2Img could help users generate images that better follow IDEA, such as the one with correct object counts and rendered scene texts in Figures 5(a,b). Idea2Img enables visual content design, in addition to generation only that requires a detailed visual content description. For example in Figure 5(c), Idea2Img designs visual logo based on the user IDEA of "having a logo for a 2024 conference in Seattle." Idea2Img can also understand user IDEA to search for images with high aesthetic scores and great visual details, or its opposite direction with "minimal face details" in Figure 5(d). The power of LMMs allows Idea2Img to extract arbitrary information from the input image for visual generation. This could be any specific object in the image, such as "the dog on the left" or "the dog pointed to via a red circle" in Figure 5(e). Figure 5(f) shows an example of extracting the image style that requires domain knowledge for humans to accurately describe. The image input can even be an in-context example that defines the desired image transformation, such as the visual style transfer shown in Figure 5(g). The ability to extract arbitrary information from the input image can be seamlessly extended to compose multiple visual and text conditions, such as composing the camera angle and image style in Figure 5(h), and two objects in Figure 5(i).

Idea2Img is also effective in finding T2I prompts for the text-conditioned image-to-image model SDXL-img2img, as shown in Figure 6. Figures 6(c) and (d) illustrate generating images that follow and differ from the reference image style of watercolor and impressionist, respectively. Idea2Img can design visual contents with the inspiration of input images, e.g., a cartoon drawing that blends the llama and the person in suits in Figure 6(f), and composing the coke with the table in an imaginative way in Figure 6(g). Figure 6(h) illustrates representing the anticipated action of rolling the sushi with a generated image. Furthermore, Figure 7 shows the Idea2Img results on other T2I models, including SD v1.5, v2.1, DeepFloyd IF, and IFimg2img. Despite the variance in the base T2I models' capacity, Idea2Img consistently helps design and generate better images.

How Idea2Img may assist humans? We use selected qualitative results to highlight the scenarios where humans might find Idea2Img most helpful in image design and generation, compared with conventional T2I generation.

- Multimodal IDEA inputs. Idea2Img provides a more natural way for human interaction, where users do not have to describe their desired image solely through texts and painstakingly search for the right terminology. Instead, the multimodal IDEA allows Idea2Img to precisely extract specific elements from one or multiple input images, such as the dog breed and color, pointed objects, artist style, camera view, and more, as shown in Figure 5. Finding proper words that the T2I model can understand for such visual concepts could be tedious for humans, e.g., the art style "with bold lines and bright colors, with a cubist and surrealistic style, with a focus on geometric shapes and patterns." in Figure 5(f). Idea2Img automates this process via Idea2Img iterative self-refinement.
- Instructional texts for intended designs and usages. Vanilla T2I models struggle to understand T2I prompts that describe the intended visual design or purpose of the generated image, such as "a logo for a 2024 conference held in Seattle" or "a car image for a children's painting competition." Instead, the prompts need to be a comprehensive description of the image to generate, e.g., "a modern and minimalist logo design, featuring the Seattle skyline in the center and the conference title below it with a blue and green color scheme" (Figure 5(c)). This demands extra drafting effort from users. In contrast, as shown in Figures 5-7, Idea2Img effectively understands the instructional texts in IDEA and creates images accordingly.

Finally, the GPT-4V iterative refinement allows Idea2Img to generate images with better semantic and visual qualities, leading to an effective automatic image creation assistant.

### 4.3. LMM Feedback, Revision, and Selection

One may wonder about the behavior and performance of LMM playing each role in Idea2Img's iterative selfrefinement pipeline, i.e., "feedback reflection," "revised prompt generation," and "draft image selection." We show corresponding qualitative results as follows.

Feedback reflection. Figure 8 shows the text feedback generated by GPT-4V for the user IDEA and the draft image and T2I prompt. Idea2Img can effectively check if the generated image is correct, such as the number of oranges in (a) and the misspelled scene text "ALURE RESEACHE" in (b). In addition to text descriptions in IDEA, Idea2Img can verify if the draft image corresponds to the visual descriptions in IDEA. This includes the color and breed of the dog in (e), the exact art style in (f), and the same cloth and pose in (g). Furthermore, Idea2Img can understand and verify the IDEA containing interleaved image-text pairs, as shown in Figures 8(h,i).

In addition to identifying the discrepancy, Idea2Img also

The image generated by the $\mathrm{Al}$ art generation model does not follow the user imagined IDEA of the scene as there are only 6 whole oranges in the image instead of 7 . To address this, the sentence prompt can be modified to specify that there should be 7 whole oranges on the table, such as in one row with exactly 7 oranges

The words on the cake in the generated image are misspelled as "ALURE RESEACHE" instead of "Azure Research". To address this, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention that the words on the cake should be spelled correctly as "Azure Research".

The person in the image is not practicing yoga mountain pose, but in a different yoga pose. Because the prompt has already mention mountain pose, the Al art model might not understand what is mountain pose. To address this, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention what is a mountain pose: posture where one stands with feet hip-width apart, arms stretched overhead, and gaze forward.

The car in the generated image is not perfect for a children's painting competition as it is too detailed and realistic. To address this, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention that the car should be simple and cartoon-like, with less details and more vibrant colors.

The dog in the generated image is not in the blue color, and does not look like the one in the given image. The dog in the given image is a pug, while the dog in the generated image is a Labrador Retriever. To address this issue, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention the breed of the dog as a pug, and the dog is in the blue color.

The style of the painting in the generated image is still not similar to the one in the given image. The given image has a cubist style with faces and objects broken up into geometric shapes and reassembled abstractly, while the generated image has a more realistic style. To address this, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention the style in the given image is 'with fragmented geometric shapes that are reassembled abstractly to form objects'.

The pose of Mr Bean in the generated image is different from the one in the given image. This is because the prompt mentions 'as the given image' but the Al art model can not understand image inputs. To address this, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention the pose in the given image is 'with his right arm stretched out and his left arm bent, holding the tennis racket with both hands'.

The image generated by the Al art generation model does not follow the user imagined IDEA of the scene as the image style is not similar to Claude Monet's impressionist paintings. To address this, the sentence prompt can be modified to specify that the image style should be similar to Claude Monet's impressionist paintings, with a bright and sunny atmosphere.

The dog in the generated image is not the same breed as the one in the given image. The dog in the given image is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, while the dog in the generated image is a husky. To address this issue, the sentence prompt should be modified to specifically mention the breed of the dog as a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The image generated by the Al art generation model does no follow the userimagined JEA of the scene as there are

points to the plausible directions that may improve the T2I prompt in the text feedback. For example, in Figure 8(c), GPT-4V mentions that "the person is not in yoga mountain pose, but the T2I prompt has already mentioned mountain pose," "the AI model might not understand what mountain pose is, and prompt should be modified to specifically mention what mountain pose is." Similarly, in Figure 8(d), Idea2Img provides guidance to have generated images better follow the user intention of "an image for a children's painting competition," by "specifically mentioning that the car should be simple and cartoon-like."

Revised prompt generation. Figure 9 compares the T2I prompts before and after revision, and visualizes how text feedback helps the revision. For example, (a) the revised T2I prompt includes a detailed description of the "yoga dolphin pose" to generate the correct body pose; (b) the revised T2I prompt mentions "an empty plate with no other objects" to avoid the T2I model misunderstand the prompt "no bananas;" (c) T2I model generates the correct hand gesture with Idea2Img providing text description on how to take a screenshot. Idea2Img also effectively addresses the identified errors in text feedback and improves the prompts for multimodal input IDEA, including the dog color in Figure $9(\mathrm{~d})$, the llama design in Figure 9(e), the study area in Figure 9(f), the human gesture in Figure $9(\mathrm{~g})$, the dog breed and human clothing in Figure 9(h), and the color of the two cats in Figure 9(i).

Draft image selection. Figure 10. T2I models may generate low-quality images even with good T2I prompts. To enable refinement in each iteration, it is critical to reduce such generation noise by selecting from multiple draft images. Performing such selection requires GPT-4V to compare multiple similar draft images and pick the one with the best overall quality. Figure 10 shows the selection results generated by GPT-4V. The LMM prompt is designed such that GPT-4V gives justifications and scores for each draft image, in addition to the final selection index. Such intermediate thoughts not only help humans interpret the selection process, but also serve as the chain of thought to improve the selection performance. We observe that GPT-4V can compare different aspects mentioned in the IDEA and give reasonable scores and selection index. For example, checking the scene text spelling in Figure 10(a); verifying the phone screen and model in Figure 10(b); counting the number of apples and bananas in Figure 10(c); verifying the ball color and dog action in Figure 10(d); finding the image with both sleep and study area in Figure 10(e); selecting the image that best fits the given image style in Figure 10(f); verifying the image content and style in Figure 10(g); locating the best blended image in Figure 10(h); and finding the image with correct dog color and image style in Figure 10(i).

## 5. Limitation and Discussion

Tasks beyond image generation. Idea2Img explores the emergent ability of multimodal self-refinement in LMMbased systems, through the image design and generation task. Specifically, Idea2Img views the T2I model to use as an unknown multimodal environment to explore, and iteratively refines T2I prompts to find its optimal usage. This concept mirrors the intrinsic human approach of iterative problem-solving when faced with unknown environments or complex challenges. We leave its extension to other intriguing tasks [48], e.g., GUI navigation, embodied agents, and complicated visual reasoning, for future exploration.

From a single image generation model to multiple tools. Idea2Img explores the usage of a single image generation model, including a text-to-image model [34] or a textconditioned image-to-image model [24]. When needed, other specialized generative models like ControlNet [56], inpainting [4], region-controlled T2I generation [21, 51], customized generation [8,35], and video generation [42,53] can be seamlessly switched as replacements. That is, Idea2Img could broadly boost different image generation models with diverse specialties by exploring their optimal text description or instruction prompts.

Beyond a single generation model, Idea2Img can also be used to allocate multiple tools as in multimodal agent studies [45,49]. In this case, Idea2Img isn't limited to optimizing the use of individual tools but also investigates their effective collaboration when used together, such as generator selection and multi-step visual generation.

Consolidating explored knowledge. We have shown the effectiveness of LMM iterative self-refinement in automatic image design and generation. Going beyond merely preserving the probed T2I model's properties in memory, Idea2Img can also help to consolidate or distill the explored knowledge into T2I model parameters, such that no inference-time iterative refinement is needed when encountering similar generation scenarios. For example, one could collect a dataset using Idea2Img for a scenario of interest, and fine-tune a T2I model with the explored selfrefinement trajectory. Storing the probed knowledge as sample-agnostic prompt for each image generation model is another promising direction $[14,32,57]$.

## 6. Conclusion

We have presented Idea2Img, a multimodal iterative selfrefinement framework that leverages GPT- $4 \mathrm{~V}$ (ision) for image design and generation. Idea2Img delves into the emergent capabilities of iterative self-refinement in LMM-based systems, showcasing its effectiveness in improving, assessing, and verifying the generated multimodal content. The user preference study demonstrates Idea2Img's capability in assisting humans to find the optimal usage of a T2I model for automatic image design and generation.

#### Abstract

We introduce DEsignBench, a text-to-image (T2I) generation benchmark tailored for visual design scenarios. Recent T2I models like DALL-E 3 [8, 67, 66] and others, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating photorealistic images that align closely with textual inputs. While the allure of creating visually captivating images is undeniable, our emphasis extends beyond mere aesthetic pleasure. We aim to investigate the potential of using these powerful models in authentic design contexts. In pursuit of this goal, we develop DEsignBench, which incorporates test samples designed to assess T2I models on both "design technical capability" and "design application scenario." Each of these two dimensions is supported by a diverse set of specific design categories. We explore DALL-E 3 together with other leading T2I models on DEsignBench, resulting in a comprehensive visual gallery for side-by-side comparisons. For DEsignBench benchmarking, we perform human evaluations on generated images in DEsignBench gallery, against the criteria of image-text alignment, visual aesthetic, and design creativity. Our evaluation also considers other specialized design capabilities, including text rendering, layout composition, color harmony, 3D design, and medium style. In addition to human evaluations, we introduce the first automatic image generation evaluator powered by GPT-4V. This evaluator provides ratings that align well with human judgments, while being easily replicable and cost-efficient. A high-resolution version is available at this link.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Overview

Advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation [1-3, 30, 37, 89, 24, 76, 96, 14, 85, 86, 78, 73, 8, $67,42]$ have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images that follow the user input text prompts. Many known challenges [58, 80, 26, 39], such as the prompt "A horse riding an astronaut" to test prompt following, text rendering, and distortions in the human face and hands generation, have been significantly improved by recent advancements, with examples postponed in Section 2. The rapid advancement naturally raises a question: what is the next goal to make T2I generation even more practically valuable? In this work, we focus on designing scenarios, and examine how the state-of-the-art T2I models can assist visual design [82, 72, 50, 51, 38, 52, 70, 100], in addition to merely generating visually pleasant results.

To this end, we present a new evaluation benchmark named DEsignBench to examine T2I models' capabilities in assisting visual design. In addition to the base T2I capabilities in standard T2I benchmarks $[44,80,96,34,21,39]$, DEsignBench evaluates visual design from two unique perspectives, i.e., the core design technical capability and the design application scenarios. We then collect evaluation prompts organized into each category and aspect. We collect the results of the state-of-the-art T2I models [73,3,2,1, 8, 67] into our DEsignBench gallery, and perform both human and GPT-4V $[68,69,93]$ evaluations on the DEsignBench. Figure 1 overviews the DEsignBench structure, with each component detailed as follows.

DEsignBench topology. DEsignBench categorizes the visual design abilities to examine into two categories, namely the design technical capability and the design application scenario. The design technical capability separately zooms into each core technical capability required for visual design, including text rendering and typography [55, 11], layout and composition [81, 71], color harmony [4, 63], medium and artistic style [56], and 3D and cinematography [60, 13]. We further define sub-categories under each capability, and manually craft text prompts accordingly. The design application scenario focuses on the real design application, which usually requires the seamless integration of multiple design technical capabilities. Example categories include infographics, animation, gaming, product, and visual art.

DEsignBench data and gallery. Based on the DEsignBench topology, we organize samples into an evaluation set of 215 prompts, with corresponding design category tags, leading to a new challenging generation benchmark focused on visual design. We collect images generated by the state-of-the-art T2I models (SDXL v1.0 [73], Midjourney v5.2 [3], Ideogram [2], Firefly 2 [1], and DALL-E 3 [8, 67]), and formulate them into the DEsignBench gallery for side-by-side qualitative comparisons.

DEsignBench evaluation. We conduct the human evaluation [75, 96, 80, 73] on images in the DEsignBench gallery, assessing them based on three primary criteria: visual aesthetics, image-text alignments, and design creativity. The design creativity aspect asks human annotators to evaluate if the generated image is a novel design, i.e., whether it showcases unique and innovative interpretations of the input prompt and brings a fresh perspective. Additionally, the evaluation also considers five other design-specific capabilities, i.e., text rendering, composition and layout, color harmony, 3D and cinematography, and medium and style, each paired with specific annotation guidelines.

Furthermore, we explore the automatic evaluation pipeline, which provides a more cost-effective approach with reproducible results. Automatic evaluation with large language models has shown promise in various natural language processing [18, 53, 27] and vision-language understanding tasks [97]. However, T2I evaluation is more complicated. It requires both a high-level semantic understanding (e.g., image-text alignment and a detailed visual comparison across two images (e.g., visual aesthetic ranking), not to mention several other design-specific criteria. Following prior studies that take large multimodal models (LMMs) [68, 69, 93, 62] for T2I image-text alignment evaluation $[8,5,95]$, we propose a pairwise model rating based on GPT-4V that comprehensively evaluates all aspects as a human annotator. The high consistency with human rating indicates the effectiveness of the proposed LMM-based T2I evaluation.

Figure 1: An overview of the DEsignBench's structure.

Our contributions are summarized as follows.

- We explore DALL-E 3 on imagining visual design. We then present DEsignBench, a new challenging text-to-image generation benchmark focusing on assisting visual design.
- We propose an automatic GPT-4V evaluation for DEsignBench evaluation, which provides reproducible results that align well with human ratings.
- We collect DEsignBench gallery, which side-by-side compares the images generated by various state-of-the-art T2I models (SDXL, Midjourney, Ideogram, Firefly2, DALL-E 3).

Remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 uses DALL-E 3 to provide an overview of the state of the art in T2I generation, and justify the experiment settings in DEsignBench. Section 3 and Section 4 introduce the design technical capability and the design application scenario, respectively, using insights from DALL-E 3. The human and GPT-4V quantitative evaluations are discussed in Section 5. Finally, the appendix shows the complete DEsignBench gallery, showcasing output comparisons among SDXL, Midjourney, Ideogram, Firefly2, and DALL-E 3.

## 2 DALL-E 3 Basics and DEsignBench Settings

In this section, we overview the state-of-the-art T2I generation capability, with explorations on DALL-E 3. We then introduce the experiment settings in DEsignBench.

### 2.1 DALL-E 3's Working Modes

ChatGPT prompt expansion. DALL-E $3[8,67,66]$ adopts ChatGPT [65] for prompt expansion, i.e., converting an input user query into a more detailed text description. As shown in Figure 2, we empirically observe that this prompt expansion (cf., user input $v s$. expanded prompt) also benefits other compared T2I models, such as SDXL [73] and Midjourney [3]. Therefore, we take the "expanded prompt" as the default setting in our DEsignBench.

In addition to DALL-E 3's default prompt expansion behavior in ChatGPT defined by the built-in system prompt, such as generating four prompts sequentially and producing four images, we find it helpful to add extra input prompts to ChatGPT for specialized prompt drafting.

- Generate a detailed description and then generate one image: Longer and more detailed prompts generally lead to better images, i.e., more object details, correct scene texts, and better image quality. We find it helpful to explicitly ask ChatGPT to provide a detailed description, and ease the task by asking for one prompt instead of four, both encourage a more detailed T2I prompt. We find this instruction particularly helpful in generating complicated scenes, such as posters, books, ads, etc., which are otherwise almost impossible to create.
- Exactly repeat the same prompt for one image: For other cases, we may want to shut down the ChatGPT prompt paraphrasing, e.g., changing a few attributes words in a controlled manner or producing the previously generated images. To achieve that, we can simply ask ChatGPT to "exactly repeat the same prompt."

Multi-round dialogue-based T2I. DALL-E 3 with ChatGPT also naturally supports the multiround dialogue-based generation. The chat interface allows users to refer to the generation history in generating the next image. For example, one may refer to a specific generated image and give an editing instruction, such as "Change the cloth in the second image into the blue color," and naturally continue with multi-round editing. Another example is to keep arbitrary visual aspects in the generated image, such as keeping the character appearance or image style when generating a multiple image comic stripe (e.g., in Figures 31-33).

### 2.2 T2I Generation Capability Overview

We next provide an overview of the DALL-E 3's generation capability, with popular testing prompts from existing benchmarks or community posts. Overall, we observe that DALL-E 3's unprecedented prompt following ability allows it to effectively solve many well-known challenge cases. This observation motivates us to go a step further, and construct DEsignBench that considers the more challenging yet valuable scenarios of visual designs.

Prompt following: detailed descriptions. Prompt following is one key challenge in T2I generation. Previous T2I models tend not to strictly follow the text prompt, leading to incorrect objects and attributes [26, 15, 10, 25]. We use the famous failure cases in PartiPrompts [96] to show DALL-E 3's prompt following capability. As shown in Figure 3, DALL-E 3 generates images with correct object counts, relative size, global and local attributes, minimal object hallucination, and scene text. As further discussed throughout the paper, unprecedented prompt following ability is critical for the imagined design scenarios, allowing designers to use arbitrary text words for image control more confidently.

Prompt following: uncommon scenes. In addition to following complicated long prompts, prompt following also requires models to faithfully generate the uncommon senses, such as the "A horse riding an astronaut." Following prompts for uncommon sense is essential for design scenarios, which usually involve imaginative creations with uncommon attributes and object combinations. In Figure 4, we examine representative challenging prompts from community posts [59]. DALL-E 3 shows the

| Word-level Acc. (\%) | Short Words | Challenging Words | Sentences | Total |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Midjourney [3] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 4.3 | 1.1 |
| SDXL [73] | 37.9 | 5.0 | 19.0 | 25.0 |
| IF [41] | 62.5 | 15.8 | 39.4 | 45.0 |
| DALL-E 3 | $\mathbf{8 3 . 3}$ | $\mathbf{3 1 . 7}$ | $\mathbf{6 2 . 4}$ | $\mathbf{6 5 . 2}$ |

Table 1: Word-level text rendering accuracy when selecting the best from $N=4$ generated images.

capability to generate uncommon spatial relationships, object shapes, attributes, etc. Such prompt following capability may assist designers in creating their imaginative pieces more easily.

Image generation: text rendering. Text rendering [49,57,16,92, 84] is critical for design scenarios, yet remains to be challenging for previous T2I models $[3,73]$. We empirically observe that DALL-E 3 can more reliably render texts in images, though still not perfect on more complicated texts. Table 1 provides a quantitative comparison of the word-level scene text accuracy on 40 constructed samples. Specifically, we run the Microsoft Azure OCR system and compare the exact match words with the text in the input prompt. We generate $N=4$ images for each prompt and report the best results. We show additional qualitative results later in Figures 6-10.

Image generation: other challenges. We also examine other common failures shared among previous T2I models, such as hand and face generation, unique art styles, challenging objects, etc. We empirically observe that DALL-E 3 works more reliably in those challenging cases. Figure 5 shows several examples of such "common failures" discussed in previous papers and community posts [58, 77, 80, 26, 39], e.g., detailed and uncommon attribute designs, uncommon scenes, etc. We group the explorations based on their usage in design scenarios, presenting in the next section "design technical capability."

## 3 Design Technical Capability

Design encompasses a broad spectrum, from product and advertisement to logo and fashion design. Essential to any design tool is the capacity to produce text, shapes, charts, and diagrams [56, 55, 11]. Beyond these basics, the tool should be adept at crafting layouts that are not only semantically accurate but also aesthetically appealing [81]. Mastery of elements such as 3D, lighting, color palettes, and varied rendering materials and styles is indispensable [60, 71, 13]. In the following section, we highlight DALL-E 3's competencies in addressing diverse design challenges.

### 3.1 Text Rendering and Typography

Figure 6 presents six diverse styled text renderings, spanning graffiti art, calligraphy, handwritten texts, mathematical symbols, multilingual scripts, and musical notations. While DALL-E 3 impressively renders English text across different styles, it exhibits some inaccuracies. The math equation, for instance, misinterprets certain operators and signs. While the layout for multilingual rendering appears organized, it struggles with certain languages, particularly Chinese and Japanese. The musical notation, while superficially resembling actual sheet music, includes several inaccuracies, underlining DALL-E 3's constraints in this domain.

Figure 7 illustrates renderings of infrequently occurring text. This includes misspelled words such as "Happpy Hallooween" and "Baaabas," and random character sequences like "CVD0p Sstpn6tsp".

Figure 8 showcases renderings of extended text passages. For instance, "Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents." The compound text "gala apple NET NT 32oz (2 LB) 907g" poses a unique challenge with its amalgamation of words, numerals, and units. Yet, DALL-E 3 produces a layout reminiscent of a store price tag.

Effective typography is more than accurate spelling [11]. Font selection is vital, needing alignment with content and medium. The choice between serif and sans-serif hinges on communication context. Font size is key, with hierarchy distinguishing headings, subheadings, and body text for clarity and visual definition. Figure 32 and 33 depict the rendering Pusheenish font in the dialogue balloons. Figure 24 showcases the font hierarchy rendering in sophisticated posters.

For clear visuals, colors must contrast well with the background and convey intended emotions. Uniform alignment ensures a cohesive, organized text presentation. Figure 23 displays various font colors in GUI design, while Figure 22 showcases DALL-E 3's alignment capabilities in creating storybook design.

When these facets converge cohesively, typography elevates from a mere conveyance of information to a medium that enhances design aesthetics and user engagement. The "Born Pink" mug in Figure 39 exemplifies this, seamlessly blending handwritten and printed styles, harmonized by color and lighting choices.

### 3.2 Layout and Composition

Creating a compelling layout and composition in design demands a keen understanding and strategic implementation of several key elements [81], ensuring that the visual space effectively communicates and resonates with the viewer.

Figure 9 displays layouts including block diagrams, pie charts, flow charts, bar graphs, tables, and calendars. While DALL-E 3 generally crafts decent layouts, it sometimes struggles with intricate details.

Figure 10 illustrates multi-panel layouts such as storyboards, how-tos, memes, and comics. Consistency in elements, colors, and patterns is vital in multi-panel designs to unify the composition and guide viewers. Designers utilize flow and movement, directing the viewer's eye using lines and element arrangements, to ensure a seamless experience.

### 3.3 Color Harmony

Color harmony is a vital principle in design that ensures various colors in a composition create a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing experience for the viewer $[64,9]$. A harmonious color palette can evoke specific emotions, set the tone, and enhance the overall impact of a piece.

Figure 11 displays variations of color palettes in oil paintings inspired by "Impression Sunrise." These range from Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter Palettes to a Romantic Palette and a monochromatic green shade. This serves as a test to see if DALL-E can adeptly control and render color palettes. DALL-E 3 effectively captures the distinct tones associated with different seasons and themes.

Figure 12 presents six color palette variations in oil paintings, inspired by "Starry Night," testing complementary color harmonies. It's striking how DALL-E captures and renders these vibrant starry scenes with such vitality and beauty.

### 3.4 Medium and Style

The artistic medium and style are crucial in visual graphic design [56], defining the work's expressive potential and emotional resonance. The medium, encompassing the tools, materials, or digital platforms employed, sets the boundaries and opportunities for expression, shaping the tactile and sensory experiences of the audience.

Figure 13 shows examples of sketching a cat in different styles including continuous line drawing, charcoal sketch, stippling sketch, brush and ink sketch, etc. Figure 14 and 15 demonstrate the capability of specifying different art media, including block print, folk art, paint-by-numbers, watercolor wood carving, Lego style, glass blowing, calligraphy, etc. These examples are just a small set of the art styles and media that DALL-E 3 covers. They provide a glimpse of DALL-E 3's capability of rendering with a broad range of artistic media and styles.

### 3.5 3D and Cinematography

3D rendering [90] and cinematography [13] are transformative tools in the world of visual representation, allowing for the creation of intricate, lifelike scenes and stories. The depth, perspective, and dynamism brought about by these techniques offer a multi-dimensional view, enhancing the viewer's experience and immersion.

Figure 16 shows examples of 3D rendering, including basic shapes, spatial relationships, lighting effects, shadow, reflections, and various viewing angles. DALL-E 3 proficiently captures self-shadows and cast shadows and effectively manages reflections on both flat and curved surfaces. The transition between two light sources is smooth. We find that DALL-E 3 sometimes does not follow view angles precisely. For example, the front view rendering is noticeably off.

In Figure 17, we show DALL-E 3's capabilities of generating special lighting effects including chemiluminescent glow, bioluminescent glow, light-painting, and Aurora glimmering.

Figure 18 shows different camera angles and positions, including closeups, bird-eye level, low and side angles. For close-up shots, DALL-E 3 blurs the background appropriately to enhance the scene depth and puts the focus on the foreground.

Figure 19 shows examples of simulating fisheye and wide angle lenses, slow and faster shutter speeds, instant camera, and tilt shift photography. At the bottom left, DALL-E 3 simulates an instant camera whose photos are usually grainy. At the bottom right, DALL-3 simulates tilt-shift photography with the focus on the lady while gradually blurring her surroundings.

Figure 20 and 21 demonstrate DALL-E 3 capabilities of rendering crowded scenes. Figure 20 shows rendering different numbers of bears. DALL-E 3 correctly generates the desired number of bears when the number is small. When the number gets larger, however, DALL-E 3 makes mistakes (as shown in the last row). Figure 21 generates images of large human crowds on a variety of occasions. We find that DALL-E 3 does a nice job of positioning the texts and rendering them with the correct perspectives. At the bottom left, DALL-E 3 generates an exaggerated scene of a popular burger eatery with a super long serving counter and a large waiting crowd. The exaggeration looks plausible and shows the popularity of the burger.

## 4 Design Scenario

In the evolving landscape of design [71, 56, 55], the prowess of AI models in various design domains has become an area of keen interest. This comprehensive analysis dives into DALL-E 3's capabilities across diverse design spectrums, from the intricacies of infographics and the dynamism of animation and gaming to the finesse required in product design and the artistic nuances in visual art. Each subsection sheds light on specific challenges and achievements of DALL-E 3, presenting a holistic view of its strengths and areas of improvement. Through a series of illustrative figures and descriptions, we unravel the depth and breadth of DALL-E 3's design proficiency, offering insights into its potential and limitations in reshaping the future of design.

### 4.1 Infographics Design

This section delves into DALL-E 3's proficiency across a spectrum of infographic designs, from storybook pages and advertisements to menus, GUIs, movie posters, logos, etc.

In Figure 22, storybook pages, research posters, and menus are presented. DALL-E 3 crafts compelling layouts for each. The storybook pages feature text paragraphs, which is a significant challenge for image generation models. While DALL-E 3 struggles with paragraph perfection, individual letters are discernible and many words remain clear.

Figure 23 showcases industrial design drafts, floor plans, and GUI designs, with DALL-E 3 producing commendable text and layout renderings.

Figure 24 depicts assorted advertisement posters and book covers, each with varying text, fonts, and sizes. For example, in the two conference posters in the middle row, there are very small texts at the bottom: "the international conference on learning representation" and "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition." It is impressive that DALL-E 3 DALL-E 3 adeptly renders the minute texts, underscoring its meticulous detailing.

Figure 25 shows movie posters, photorealistic advertisement posters, and cartoon book pages. In the movie poster at the top left, DALL-E 3 does a nice job of rendering the main character in a way that smoothly transitions between the two very different color themes. In the advertisement image at the middle left, both the brand name "crispy" and the slogan "unleash the fizz" are spelled correctly, and their rendering follows the curvature of the soda can surface. In addition, the can that the person is holding has the same look as the "Crispy" soda.

Figure 26 and 27 offer glimpses into logo designs, postcards, and themed greeting cards. Logos are sleek, while greeting cards aptly capture seasonal and cultural nuances.

Lastly, Figure 28 displays coloring book pages, where DALL-E 3 retains the signature black and white line drawing style. Figure 29 presents sticker designs set against a pristine background.

### 4.2 Animation/Gaming Design

This section explores DALL-E 3's capabilities in animation and game designs, including cinematic scenes, comic strips, storyboards, and in-game scenes.

Figure 30 shows examples of cinematic scenes. DALL-E 3 does a decent job of using closeup shots, scene depth, and lighting to enhance the drama and intensity.

Figure 31, 32, 33 present comic strips across multiple panels. Despite generating each panel independently, DALL-E 3 consistently retains character identities and adeptly positions dialogue bubbles with legible texts.

Figure 34 shows a storyboard of two warriors going from fighting to reconciliation. There are 6 images, and each image is generated independently. DALL-E 3 successfully creates the gradual emotion changes of the two warriors. In addition, DALL-E 3 is able to maintain the identities of the two warriors across the panels.

Figure 35 highlights emojis and varied cartoon styles, spanning Comics, Anime, and Ghibli.

Lastly, Figure 36 and 37 shows examples of various game-related scenarios. DALL-E 3 understands the difference between a game scene (e.g., middle left) and a game-playing environment (bottom left). In addition, it is able to generate a first-person shooter perspective with a GUI panel.

### 4.3 Product Design

This section explores DALL-E 3's capabilities in product and fashion designs as well as clothing alterations.

Figure 38 and 39 show a variety of product designs. All the product images generated by DALL-E 3 look elegant with appealing color and texture. The text font matches very well with the corresponding product type. It is interesting to note that in the "Born Pink" mug image at the middle left of Figure39, the letters "B" and "P" share a half letter. The sharing looks so natural that it is hardly noticeable.

Figure 40 presents fashion design examples. The line sketch style gives a professional look. The dresses look appropriate for the corresponding seasons.

Lastly, Figure 41 exhibits clothing alterations. DALL-E 3 adeptly interprets text prompts, adjusting garment colors and styles with precision.

### 4.4 Visual Art Design

This section explores DALL-E 3's capabilities in 3D sculpture design, historical art recreation, and time-space travel.

Figure 42 shows examples of 3D sculpture designs. At the middle left, the prompt indicates to add Sun Wukong, who is the beloved Monkey King from the Chinese novel "Journey to the West," as the fifth statue in Mount Rushmore, but DALL-E 3 mistakenly added three statues of Sun Wukong. Nonetheless, the generated image gives an illusion of being sculpted on the rock.

Figure 43 shows examples of recreating historical arts, including the city life of the capital city in the Tang dynasty and London in 1816. The image at the bottom right is an imagination of Times Square in 2075, which looks futuristic with green buildings and flying vehicles.

Figure 44 shows a variety of knolling examples. We find that DALL-E 3's knolling design usually contains a lot of detailed elements. Even though the number of elements is sometimes very large, their geometric arrangement is always aesthetically pleasing.

## 5 DEsignBench and Evaluation Results

DEsignBench evaluates design from two perspectives: (i) Design technical capabilities: we measure the core technical capabilities for visual design, including text rendering and typography [55, 11], layout and composition [81, 71], color harmony [4, 63], medium and artistic style [56], and 3D and cinematography $[60,13]$; (ii) Design application scenarios: we consider a variety of real design applications, such as infographic, animation, gaming, visual arts, and product design.

We collect text prompts that encompass a diverse range of design scenarios. In total, we collected 215 user inputs, systematically organized following the data topology introduced in Sections 3,4. Utilizing the ChatGPT interface $[65,68]$ of DALL-E 3, these collected user inputs were expanded and detailed, resulting in a more nuanced and detailed set of descriptions. As discussed in Section 2, we observed that the expanded text prompts are helpful in improving the design fidelity across all experimented T2I models $[73,3,2,1,8,67]$. Therefore, we conduct the experiments and evaluation using the expanded text prompts.

In the Appendix, we present the DEsignBench gallery containing all images generated by the experimented state-of-the-art T2I models. All the text prompts and images used in the evaluation will be publicly available for future research.

### 5.1 Evaluation Method and Metric

Human evaluation. We conducted pairwise comparisons to assess the design technical capabilities of current Text-to-Image (T2I) models. We involve five participants who have experience with T2I tools.

As shown in Table 2, each participant was presented with an expanded text prompt followed by two images, each generated by different T2I models. The participants were then instructed to perform a pairwise comparison, employing a diverse set of criteria to judge which of the two given images is preferred. To facilitate a detailed examination, participants were permitted to adjust the image view by zooming in or out, thereby inspecting finer visual details for informed judgment. We refer readers to Table 2 for details on the evaluation criterion and annotation instruction, i.e., the three overall ratings on image-text alignment, aesthetics, and design, and the other five design-specific capabilities.

For each criterion shown in Table 2, participants were directed to choose between two alternatives: (i) Image 1 or (ii) Image 2. Additionally, to glean deeper insights into their rationales, the participants were encouraged to supplement their choices with qualitative feedback.

We also note that certain design-specific capabilities are only evaluated on a subset of prompts. For instance, if a pair of images lacks rendered texts, such pairs are disregarded during the evaluation of the text rendering capability.

Given the rigorous nature of the evaluation process, characterized by an extensive set of inquiries (i.e., 8 questions per pairwise comparison), we strategically reduced a portion of the annotation workload. Consequently, participants were assigned to assess a specific subset of pairwise comparisons, including the following comparisons: DALL-E 3-Midjourney; DALL-E 3-SDXL; Midjourney-SDXL; and Midjourney-Firefly2.

GPT-4V evaluation. Recent studies $[29,53,19,18,91,101,33,20,87,23,47,46,97,45,5$, 31, 99, 54, 74] have underscored the promising capabilities of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) $[68,65,88]$ as automated evaluators across various language and vision-language tasks. With the emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) [68, 69, 93, 62] such as GPT-4V [69], an intriguing question arises: can GPT-4V be effectively harnessed for T2I evaluations? Following prior studies that take LMMs for image-text alignment evaluation [8, 5, 95], we propose a pairwise model rating based on GPT-4V that comprehensively evaluates all aspects as a human annotator Table 3 shows the prompt design we used for the experiments. First, GPT-4V takes two images and the text prompt as inputs. Then, GPT-4V compares the two images using the evaluation criteria listed in Table 2, addressing each criterion sequentially. Finally, GPT-4V describes its rationale and then selects one of the two images. In our experiments, we invoke GPT-4V five times, and subsequently report the mean and variance of the results.

Table 2: Example questionnaire for human evaluation. Participants were presented with a text prompt followed by two images. Participants were instructed to compare the two images and answer all the 8 questions. For each question, participants were asked to select one of two options: (i) Image 1 or (ii) Image 2. See Section 5.1 for more details.

### 5.2 Compared T2I Models

We compare DALL-E 3 with the recent state-of-the-art T2I models, including Midjourney V5.2 [3], Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SDXL) [73], Ideogram [2], and Adobe Firefly 2 [1]. Note that some of these models come as part of the integrated software programs with additional functionalities, such as image editing. We omit these features and evaluate exclusively their T2I capabilities.

Each T2I model takes the expanded text prompt as input, and generates four image variations. We randomly select an image without cherry-pick for evaluation. Given 215 text prompts and five T2I models, we have 2150 pairs in total for pairwise comparison.

Table 3: Prompt design for GPT-4V assisted evaluation, where $\mathcal{I}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{2}$ are the two images, and $\mathcal{P}$ is the expanded text prompt. Taking the prompt template filled with $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{I}_{1}$, and $\mathcal{I}_{2}$, GPT-4V will output its thought and select one of the given two images. We highlight the evaluation criterion considered in this example in yellow . The criterion can be replaced with the other ones listed in Table 2. The prompt design is inspired by [8].

You are responsible for assessing the fidelity of images created by computer programs in relation to their guiding captions.

You will be presented with a caption followed by two images, each generated by different software. The images you are judging are designed to stress-test image generation programs.

Your role is to compare the given two images.

Please consider only the following aspects when making your judgement:

- Text Rendering: Is rendered text legible and appropriately styled? Is the spelling correct? Are font choices, spacing, and alignment harmonious with the overall design?

Deliberate on their merits, pondering the aboved mentoned aspects, and conclude which one excels. After thinking out loud, you should output either 'I Image 1' or ' $I$ Image 2'.

A few rules:

1. Do not nitpick. If the caption requests multiple objects and most objects are generally depicted correctly, then it is good.
2. Ignore other objects in the image that are not explicitly mentioned by the caption; it is fine for these to be shown.
3. It is $\mathrm{OK}$ if the object being depicted is slightly deformed, as long as a human would recognize it. 4. Your response must always end with either ' $I$ Image 1' or 'I Image 2'
4. Please try to find which one is better. In rare case, if you think both images are equally bad, random choose one is fine.
5. You must keep your thinking out loud short, less than 50 words.

Caption: $\mathcal{P}$

Image 1: $\mathcal{I}_{1}$

Image 2: $\mathcal{I}_{2}$

### 5.3 Evaluation Results

Results on human evaluation. Figure 45 shows the category-specific comparison among DALLE 3, Midjourney, SDXL, and Firefly 2, on DEsignBench. We observe that human annotators prefer the images generated by DALL-E 3 more than those of Midjourney and SDXL in all eight categories considered. In addition, Midjourney garnered preference over SDXL in seven out of the eight categories, except for text rendering. Midjourney proves slightly more favorable than Firefly2 in five out of the eight categories. These findings indicate a hierarchical preference, with DALL-E 3 emerging as the most favorable model. Midjourney and Firefly2 occupy the second tier, demonstrating substantial competence, while SDXL appears positioned within the third tier in the DEsignBench evaluations.

Results on GPT-4V evaluation. To assess the efficacy of GPT-4V as an automated evaluator, we conduct a consistency analysis. Figure 46 illustrates the correlation between human preferences and the assessments executed by GPT-4V on DEsignBench. This analysis involved invoking the GPT-4V five times, and subsequently reporting on the mean and variance of the results. Our observations indicate that the judgments by GPT-4V predominantly concur with human evaluations, with sporadic discrepancies most notable in the evaluation of text rendering capabilities when comparing Midjourney-SDXL and Midjourney-Firefly2. Despite these occasional divergences, GPT$4 \mathrm{~V}$ exhibits relatively reliable performance across a spectrum of evaluative criteria, demonstrating its potential as an automated tool for T2I evaluation, particularly in pairwise comparisons.

Figures 47-48 show the GPT-4V evaluation results on comparing the five T2I models considered. In the experiments, we invoke the GPT-4V five times, and report the mean and variance of the results.

Figure 45: Human evaluation results on DEsignBench.

DALL-E 3 stands out as the most favorable model, followed by Firefly 2 and Midjourney within the second tier. SDXL and Ideogram are positioned within the third tier. We observe a notable consistency in GPT-4V evaluation, given the absence of any cyclical anomalies in the pairwise comparisons reviewed.

Finally, we present example outputs of GPT-4V evaluator in Tables 4-7. We observe that GPT-4V can correctly analyze the images and make reasonable assessments. Tables 8-9 show representative failure cases of the GPT-4V evaluator. We observe that GPT-4V may make a mistake in counting the teddy bears in the occlusion scenario. GPT-4V may struggle to read the small text, and instead shift its attention towards evaluating the overall aesthetics of the image.

### 5.4 Limitations of DALL-E 3

We next discuss the representative failure cases and model limitations. First, DALL-E 3 may still fail on certain challenging prompts that describe uncommon or complicated scenes. For example, "all buildings of the same height" in Figure 49(a), "guitar without string" in (b), "fork in the pumpkin" in (c), "quarter-sized pizza" in (d), "to the left of" in (e), and the green grass in the left- and right-most part of (f).

DALL-E 3 has shown an impressive performance in text rendering and layout composition. However, document generation still remains a formidable challenge, hindering the achievement of flawless design outputs. Further enhancing the model's text rendering capabilities would significantly elevate the quality of visual design, as exemplified by the need for precise text generation in storybooks, posters, and book covers shown in Figure 50(a,c,e). In addition to generating accurate Latin characters, there is a need for the model to improve visual and scene text semantic alignments (e.g., the incorrect pie chart portion in (b)), incorporate support for customizable fonts (e.g., for the chart title in (d)), and extend its capabilities to include multiple languages as in (f).

We observe that the generation artifacts still exist in certain types of generated images. Notably, the skin texture in Figure 51(a), and the human faces in the crowded scene (b), appear to be somewhat unnatural. Additionally, the model might also misunderstand certain generation settings, such as the camera setting "fast shutter speed" in (c), and the person counts in (d).

Finally, DALL-E 3 currently has limited support for extended image generation functionalities [98, 95, 42], such as editing uploaded images [61, 32, 12, 36], concept customization [79, 40, 6, 17, 83], style transfer [28, 35, 48, 22], region control [94, 43], spatial condition [98, 7], etc. Several of these extended functionalities may ease and enhance the visual design process. For example, the incorporation of image condition input could empower designers to refine and build upon existing designs, such as the "halo armor" in Figure 51(e) or their prior designs, instead of starting from scratch. The region control [94] may allow designers to more precisely place texts and other visual elements.

#### Abstract

At present, large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive generalization capabilities in understanding and generating visual signals. However, they currently still lack sufficient capability to perceive low-level visual quality akin to human perception. Can LMMs achieve this and show the same degree of generalization in this regard? If so, not only could the versatility of LMMs be further enhanced, but also the challenge of poor cross-dataset performance in the field of visual quality assessment could be addressed. In this paper, we explore this question and provide the answer "Yes!". As the result of this initial exploration, we present VisualCritic, the first LMM for broad-spectrum image subjective quality assessment. VisualCritic can be used across diverse data right out of box, without any requirements of dataset-specific adaptation operations like conventional specialist models. As an instruction-following LMM, VisualCritic enables new capabilities of (1) quantitatively measuring the perceptual quality of given images in terms of their Mean Opinion Score (MOS), noisiness, colorfulness, sharpness, and other numerical indicators, (2) qualitatively evaluating visual quality and providing explainable descriptions, (3) discerning whether a given image is AI-generated or photographic. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VisualCritic by comparing it with other open-source LMMs and conventional specialist models over both AI-generated and photographic images.


## 1 Introduction

Research on Large Multimedia Models (LMMs) is at an exciting but still preliminary juncture. Current LMMs have shown impressive generalization capabilities in understanding high-level semantics $1,22,35,70$ and generating visual signals $17,60,61$ in an instruction-following manner. Recent benchmark work 53 and our experiments have both found that current LMMs struggle to perceive the low-level quality of visual signals in line with human perception. To remedy[^0]

- User Instruction: Please describe the visual quality of this image in words.

\# MiniGPT-4: The image shows a group of people walking down a long, white tiled hallway. The people are wearing coats and appear to be looking at their phones. There are red lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a few shops on either side of the hallway. The lighting in the image is bright and even, with the white tiles reflecting the light. The image appears to be well-lit and clear.

\# LLaVA: The visual quality of the image is quite good. The scene is well-lit, with the man and woman walking down a hallway in a mall. The background is clear, and the people in the scene are well-defined. The image is in focus, and the colors are vibrant, which adds to the overall visual appeal. The image captures a moment in time, showcasing the common sight of people using their cell phones while walking. \# InstructBLIP: The image features two people walking down a hallway in a shopping mall. One of the people is wearing a coat, while the other is wearing a jacket. They are both using their cell phones as they walk along the hallway. (Failed to describe the visual quality of the image) \# GPT-4V:The image is quite blurry, which affects the clarity of the details. The blurriness makes it difficult to distinguish specific features of the people and objects within the image. The figures appear to be moving, as suggested by the streaks and smears around their silhouettes, which may have contributed to the lack of focus. The lighting seems to be bright and even, without harsh shadows or overexposure, but due to the blurriness, it's hard to make out any finer details or colors. Overall, the visual quality is low, preventing a clear understanding of the scene.dd \# VisualCritic (Ours): The image has been assessed across various visual quality parameters. Its overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS) indicates a relatively low subjective quality perception. The image exhibits a fairly balanced brightness level, ensuring it's not too dim or excessively bright. The colors present are somewhat muted, which may affect the overall vibrancy and liveliness of the visual experience. The contrast between lighter and darker areas is moderate, but there is room for improvement in terms of visual depth and clarity. A significant amount of noise can be observed, likely due to graininess or other artifacts, which may detract from the overall quality. The details in the image are rather unclear, and there is considerable scope for enhancement in terms of sharpness and crispness.

- User Instruction: Is it a real photo or an AI-generated image?

\# MiniGPT-4: The image appears to be a real photo. The boat is floating in the water and there are rocks and cliffs in the background. The colors of the water and the sky are also realistic. \# LLaVA: The image is a real photo of a boat in the water.

\# InstructBLIP: Real photo.

\# GPT-4V: The image appears to be that of a real photograph. It depicts a light blue boat with some white and darker blue detailing, floating on clear, calm water. The reflection of the boat is visible in the water, and there are other boats and rocky terrain in the background. The clarity of the reflection, the natural gradation of colors, and the details in the rocks and water suggest that it is a photograph rather than an AI-generated image. However, without analyzing the file's data or metadata, I cannot definitively conclude whether it is a real photo or AI-generated.

\# VisualCritic (Ours) : This image looks like an AI-generated image, it seems to be a more realistic AI-generated image.

(b) Comparison of our VisionCritic with other LMMs on authenticity detection. The image2 is AI-generated. Errors are red-highlighted.

Fig. 1: Illustration of the comparison between existing LMMs and our proposed VisualCritic for visual subjective quality assessment from the perspectives of quantitative measurement, qualitative evaluation and authenticity detection. The results show VisualCritic is the best one of its kind to perform consistently well over different relevant tasks.

this shortcoming, we aim to comprehensively enhance the capability of LMMs in this aspect.

Visual quality assessment aims to qualify the perceptual quality of visual signals in accordance with human perception. In this field, conventional specialist methods $12,43,44,49,65,68$ have already achieved high statistical correlation with human subjective ratings for in-domain (within-dataset) settings. Although a given dataset can be well fitted, qualifying visual perceptual quality in a general scope remains highly challenging due to the diversity of visual signals and
the complexity of human perception. Amidst the vast volume and diversity of visual signals we experience daily, the broad applicability of this technology determines its genuine practicality. Besides, we believe in its potential immense value in interplaying with AIGC models for better visual alignment, by serving as a generic reward model. Just as an excellent cook typically necessitates a sensitive palate. Thus, constructing a generally applicable visual quality assessment model is indisputably important. Beyond numerical results, we also expect a generalist model for visual quality assessment to enable more functionalities, e.g., explanatory descriptions or authenticity detection.

Nevertheless, both current LMMs and conventional specialist models are far from satisfactory in this aspect. Regarding the generalizability: The evaluation results in Figure 1 show that all LMMs, apart from ours, perform poorly in quantitative assessment, revealing clear gaps with humans ratings. Their basic quantitative assessment capabilities are lacking, let alone generalization. Conventional specialist models perform well for within-dataset visual quality assessment, but still struggle to cross-dataset evaluation due to unaligned human ratings over different datasets. They commonly rely on dataset-specific adaptation technologies $21,26,71$, requiring access to the target domain thus limiting their practicality. Regarding the versatility: As illustrated in Figure 1, all open-source LMMs give the qualitative judgements obviously inconsistent with human perception. Their responses are more about semantic captions instead of the visual quality. GPT-4V [35] is able to give a basically reasonable response, but also tends to output semantic captions for scene understanding. All LMMs, apart from ours, fail to distinguish an AI-generated image. Conventional models do not supported these functionalities.

In this work, we make the first endeavour to build an LMM for broadspectrum image subjective quality assessment, taking into account both generalizability and versatility. To this end, we find the model architecture is not the key, but an appropriate data construction and an effective training strategy are. We thus follow the common practices in building other LLMs $3,7,22,25,38,70$ to configure the model with a pre-trained vision encoder, a pre-trained LLM and a learnable adapter. Without a doubt, collecting a large-scale dataset with human ratings from scratch is extremely expensive. A straightforward solution is to combine publicly accessible datasets into a big one for joint training. However, in fact, this fails to deliver favorable results as we ever imagined, due to the rating inconsistency among different datasets. Detailed reasons are analyzed later. Through data analysis, we realize that the relativity of human ratings is much more transferable across different datasets than their absolute values. To utilize this characteristic, we propose a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy, in which we first perform the relativity learning on large-scale data from diverse sources and then adopt a few samples to unleash the capability of precisely estimating absolute scores. This effectively facilitates the learning of enabling an LMM to perceive low-level visual quality in a broad range akin to human perception.

As a result, we propose VisualCritic, the first LMM of its kind to support broad-spectrum image subjective quality assessment. Compared to conventional specialist models in the field of visual quality assessment, VisualCritic exhibits the state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization ability over both photographic and AI-generated images. Besides, in addition to chat capabilities, it enables more domain-relevant functionalities for providing qualitative descriptions and performing authenticity detection.

### 2.1 Large Multimodal Models

Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have begun to showcase their preliminary prowess, riding on the coattails of the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). Initial research efforts $1,22 \mid 70$ in this field have managed to accomplish preliminary multimodal universality by merely training a minimal number of parameters serving for adaptation and projection, effectively uniting frozen visual foundation models with pre-trained language foundation models. Subsequent research works further enhance their capabilities from different perspectives. Kosmos-2 [38], MiniGPT-v2 [3] and Ferret [59 enhance the spatial perception capabilities of multimodal large models, equipping them to be more applicable for a wide array of tasks with object bounding boxes involved. Kosmos-2.5 30 develops the literate capability. Kosmos-G [36], MiniGPT-5 [69] and CM3Leon 661] try to unify both general-purpose semantic understanding and visual generation with a single model. Besides, there are a series of works building multimodal agents $13,42,45,55,66$ to systematically complete their functionality and enhance their practicality in different application scenarios. In this work, we make the first endeavour towards a leap in the low-level perception capability of LMMs for visual quality.

### 2.2 Visual Quality Assessment

Visual quality assessment aims to quantify the perceptual quality of visual signals in accordance with human perception, beyond classic metrics like PSNR or SSIM [52]. Full-reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) 12, 49] requires estimating the quality distance of the distorted image between the reference image to then estimate the quality score of the distorted one. In contrast, a more challenging and practical task setting is the no-reference image quality assessment $43,44,65,68$, also known as blind image quality assessment, wherein no reference images are provided. In this field, it is relatively easy to fit a given dataset while the real challenge lies in being generally applicable for samples in the wild. For this, cross-dataset adaptation technologies 2126 71 are developed. But they require the annotations of target datasets for model fine-tuning, which limits their practicality and imposes strong application and research demands for developing an IQA generalist model that could be used out of the box on diverse data.

Fig. 2: The framework of our proposed VisualCritic, which comprises a frozen vision encoder, a learned cross-modality adapter and a LoRA-tuned LLM decoder. VisualCritic is the first of its kinds to support diverse visual quality assessment tasks, including relative quality comparison, quantitative measurement, qualitative evaluation and authenticity detection.

With the advent of large-scale models, GPT-4V [35] has been explored to evaluate text-to-image results from the perspective of design quality in [24] and shows very preliminary promise in predicting human preference for visual aesthetics and text-image alignment [54]. For IQA, as we evaluated, it can provide basically reasonable textual descriptions, but cannot accurately predict quantitative results or distinguish between AI-generated images and real images. Besides, a series of open-source LMMs are evaluated right out of the box in [53 but they all perform poorly on quantitative visual quality assessment. We are the first to construct an LMM for IQA with unprecedented generalizability and versatility. In addition to quantitative assessment as prior specialist models, our model can further provide linguistic descriptions and accomplish authenticity detection.

## 3 VisualCritic

### 3.1 Model Architecture

As indicated in recent reports 12,49 , current LMMs have preliminarily shown the potential to capture the perceptual quality of images, but they still cannot make precise judgments and support comprehensive assessment in the general scope. For our VisualCritic, we inherit as much world knowledge as possible and
the conversational ability from the pre-trained weights and infuse new knowledge to endow it with our target capability. As illustrated in Figure 2. VisualCritic consists of a vision encoder, a LLM decoder and a cross-modality adapter as common designs in $3,22,30,38$. In specific, we adopt a pre-trained EVA model [9] as the vision encoder to encode vision inputs into a series of tokens. These tokens are transformed to the input embedding space of a LLM decoder by an adapter with the same architecture as that in 22 . We adopt an open-sourced Vicuna-13B 6s the LLM decoder. We empirically find the model architecture is not the key to VisualCritic, instead, the data construction and the training strategy are. We delineate them in the following.

### 3.2 Data Construction

Given an image $x$, VisualCritic could assess its perceptual quality by not only estimating a series of quantitative metrics $y_{\text {score }}$ like conventional specialist models but also providing natural language descriptions $y_{d e s c}$. This advances explainable visual quality assessment. Besides, it can also distinguish whether a given image $x$ is AI-generated or not, outputting $y_{a i g c}$. We introduce their corresponding data construction respectively as follows.

Quantitative measurement. VisualCritic quantitatively assesses the perceptual quality of given images by estimating the most commonly used metric for subjective quality, i.e., Mean Opinion Score (MOS) [46], and a series of quality attribute indicators including the brightness, colorfulness, contrast, noisiness, and sharpness. To enable this, we gather data with human subjective ratings from different public sources (details are listed in Table 1) and normalize the numerical annotations to the range of $[0,100]$.

Nevertheless, training a visual quality assessment generalist with mixed datasets is much more challenging than we ever imagined. We experimentally find that straightforwardly combining samples from different datasets in joint training even performs worse than training on a single dataset when performing crossdataset evaluation. This is because subjective annotations of different datasets are collected in different experiment environments and from different annotators 21. Due to the inherent differences in visual quality among different datasets, it is difficult for different annotators to score a certain dataset with a unified standard over all datasets. Such inconformity starves generalization.

An intuitive way to address this inconformity issue is to rebuild a large-scale dataset over diverse images and have annotators score with a unified standard, which is, however, quite costly and hard to accomplish. Considering that the judgement of relative quality is obviously easier to generalize, we propose a curriculum learning scheme. Specifically, we first teach VisualCritic to discern the relativity of visual quality using large-scale data from diverse sources, then use a few samples without the label inconformity issue to enable it to further output absolute scores. We take MOS as an example to introduce the data construction process in detail, with other metrics employing analogous methods. For the relativity learning, we sample two different images $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}\right\}$ from the
same dataset each time, and set the corresponding label $y_{\text {mos }}=[1,0]$ if the MOS of $x_{1}$ is higher than that of $x_{2}$, otherwise $y_{\text {mos }}=[0,1]$. Then, we prompt GPT4 34 to generate the dialogue data upon the relative quality labels following the conversation template design of Vicuna 6. For the absolute score estimation, we take the normalized MOS as its corresponding labels, and structure the training data in a dialogue form, following a shared format used for relativity learning. This unified format will be detailed in the following.

Qualitative evaluation. VisualCritic can further provide qualitative evaluation regarding the perceptual quality of given images in a more comprehensive view. The outputs incorporate but are not limited to various indicators in quantitative measurement, beyond their numerical values, enabling interpretability. To achieve this, given each sample, we prompt GPT-4 34 to generate its corresponding dialogue-form training data in the same format with that for quantitative measurement on top of the ground truths of aforementioned quantitative indicators. The knowledge of GPT-4 is distilled in the annotations of our training data in this way. As a result, VisualCritic integrates the knowledge pertinent to visual quality assessment from its own pre-trained weights, GPT-4 and multiple public datasets, making it be a model "standing on the shoulders of giants".

Authenticity detection. Aforementioned functionalities of quantitative measurement and qualitative evaluation can be applied for both AI-generated and photographic images. Towards further versatility, VisualCritic is also endowed with the authenticity detection capability, i.e., discerning whether a given image is AI-generated or photographic. For a given image $x$, its label regarding the authenticity $y_{\text {auth }}=1$ if $x$ is a photographic image, otherwise $y_{\text {auth }}=0$. $\left(x, y_{\text {auth }}\right)$ is prompted to be a dialogue form, analogous to those for quantitative measurement and qualitative evaluation. Details are in the supplementary.

Unified format and data summary. The training data for above three functionalities adopt a unified format following the conversation template design of Vicuna [6] as below:

```
Human: $<i m g 1>\left\{i m g 1 \_\right.$content $\}</ i m g 1>(<i m g 2>$
$\{i m g 2$ _content $\}</$ img $2>)[$ Task
Identifier]\{instruction_content\}
Assistant: $\{$ answer_content $\}$
```

In this format, $<i m g>$ and $</ i m g>$ are special tokens marking the start and end of the token sequence of an image, respectively. \{img_content $\}$, \{instruction_content $\}$ and \{answer_content $\}$ are three placeholders of the tokens of input image, user instruction and VisualCritic's response, respectively. The contents in the brackets are optional, only existing in the training data

ing for aforementioned three functionalities as a multi-task problem and introduce a task identifier [Task Identifier] to reduce the ambiguity across different tasks. It is instantiated as $<I Q A \_Q U A N T>,<I Q A \_D E S>$ and $<A U T H E N T I C I T Y>$ for quantitative measurement, qualitative evaluation

and authenticity detection, respectively. We summarize all adopted datasets for different purposes in Table 1, and detail their corresponding training strategies subsequently.

### 3.3 Training Strategy

To ensure both high generalization performance and versatility, we introduce a multi-stage training strategy for VisualCritic, with each stage serving its own purpose as shown in Table 1. Let us detail them below.

Stage-1: relativity learning. We first subject VisualCritic to the relativity learning with large-scale data from different sources for enabling it to rank the relative quality of multiple image diversely. This can effectively address the label inconformity issue on visual subjective quality across different datasets and is consistent with the intuition that it is easier to rank image of different quality than to rate them. In this stage, VisualCritic acquires preliminary perception for visual quality aligned with human preference.

Stage-2: multifunctional training. Afterwards, we perform multifunctional training to unleash the capabilities of quantitative measurement, qualitative evaluation and authenticity detection as introduced before. We integrate the data for different functionalities as described in Sec. 3.2 into a joint training framework, where we use $<$ Task Identifier $>$ to differentiate tasks and each batch only contains one. In this stage, the knowledge of VisualCritic acquired in the stage1 are further enhanced to accomplish specific tasks in an instruction following manner.

Stage-3: instruction tuning. Finally, we manually select some high-quality samples from the training data of the first two stages and combine them with general-purpose dialogue data to perform the instruction tuning for VisualCritic, so as to improving the quality and robustness of its responses to user instructions.

The data sources for the training of different stages are summarized in Table 1. They are all structured to be the aforementioned unified dialogue format in the way described in Sec. 3.2. This modelling allows us to train VisualCritic with a plain but universal auto-regressive optimization objective, which can be denoted
as below:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{maximize} \sum_{n=2}^{N_{y}} \mathbf{E}_{\hat{P}}\left[\log P\left(\boldsymbol{y}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{1: N_{x}}, \boldsymbol{y}_{1: n-1}\right)\right] \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathbf{E}_{\hat{P}}[\cdot]$ is the expectation operator with respect to the distribution $\hat{P}$. Here, $\hat{P}$ is the expected distribution (i.e., ground-truth distribution) of $P . \mathbf{E}_{\hat{P}}[\cdot]$ is commonly implemented by a cross-entropy function between $P$ and $\hat{P} . \boldsymbol{x}_{1: N_{x}}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}_{1: n-1}$ are the image tokens and preceding language tokens, respectively.

## 4 Experiments

### 4.1 Implementation Details

Throughout the training process, the visual backbone of VisualCritic remains frozen. The linear layer in the adapter and the language model are initialized with the weights of $[70$ and are trained efficiently with LoRA 15,32 techniques. We employ a rank setting of $\mathrm{r}=16$. The model is trained using a $224 \times 224$ image resolution at all stages. We employ the AdamW [29] optimizer paired with a cosine learning rate scheduler [28] for model training. In the first stage, we conduct training over 50,000 steps using $4 \times$ A100 GPUs, with a global batch size of 96 and a base learning rate of $2 \mathrm{e}-4$. This stage is completed in approximately 12 hours. In the second stage, the model is trained for 10,000 steps on $4 \times$ A100 GPUs, maintaining a global batch size of 96 and a base learning rate of 5e-5, taking around 2 hours. Finally, the model undergoes an additional 5,000 training steps on $4 \times$ A100 GPUs, with a global batch size of 64 , completed in about 1 hour. The maximum learning rate remains constant at $1 \mathrm{e}-5$ during this final stage.

We normalize the ranges of human ratings with linear scaling to [0-100]. Note that the rating inconsistencies in specific values persist as analyzed in Sec. 3.2 . This is the driving force behind our proposal of relativity learning.

Unless otherwise stated, we employ Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) as the evaluation metrics following the common practices in this field $43,44,53,65$. More implementation details are provided in supplementary.

### 4.2 Quantitative Results

Comparison to LMMs. Our goal is to build an LMM that can perceive visual quality like humans. We thus first compare the proposed VisualCritic to other open-source LMMs in this aspect. The alignment between model outputs and human preference on the most widely used metric MOS is measured by two correlation coefficients SPCC and PLCC in Table 2. We can observe that across different datasets including both photographic and AI-generated ones, VisualCritic performs the best and outperforms other LLMs by a large margin.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

This demonstrates that our VisualCritic statistically achieves the highest consistency with human preference of visual perceptual quality among existing $\mathrm{LMMs}$, whether for photographic or AI-generated images. It showcases a high potential for improved visual alignment. We selected the MiniGPT4 70 as our baseline due to its straightforward implementation, allowing us to eliminate the confounding effects of more elaborate designs on our experimental results. A comparison of it with other LLMs is presented in Table 2 Moreover, it is impractical to require LLMs in Table 2 to be compared using the same training data since their pre-training and training are performed on large-scale general-purpose datasets. These datasets may already encompass the data for IQA. Additionally, the data construction is a key factor in determining the varying capabilities of different large models, which also stands as one of our main contributions.

We admit that there is still a performance gap between VisualCritic and SOTA IQA specialist models in terms of the within-dataset quantitative performance. Detailed comparison results can be found in our supplementary. The significance of developing VisualCritic, such an LMM for this lies in its generalizability and practicality. VisualCritic attains the performance over different datasets listed in Table 2 with a single model right out of the box, while a model is trained for a specific dataset for conventional IQA methods. The latter kind fits a given dataset well but suffers from poor cross-dataset generalization, severely limiting the practicality. To the best of our knowledge, VisualCritic is the first one of its kind to handle such diverse datasets including both photographic and AI-generated samples simultaneously. It can be constructed upon a commonly used LMM architecture, trained with a plain auto-regressive loss and can be used effortlessly right out of the box without additional adaptation. Besides, VisualCritic provides rich functionalities as introduced before and has the chat ability.

Table 3: Comparison results (MOS) of our VisualCritic with conventional specialist models on the generalizable visual subjective quality assessment. The " $S$ " and " $T$ " denotes the source and target datasets, respectively. For VisualCritic-S, we only perform the training of Stage-2 and Stage-3, corresponding to a single-source generalization. For VisualCritic-M, we perform the training of all three stages with the target dataset discarded from the training data in all stages, corresponding to a multi-source generalization. Metrics are shown as SPCC/PLCC.

Comparison to conventional IQA models. We further compare our VisualCritic with conventional IQA specialist models in terms of their cross-dataset generalization ability. Detailed results are in Table 3 For single-source generalization, VisualCritic-S is superior to conventional IQA models thanks to the integration of world knowledge from pre-trained weights (via parameter inheritance) and GPT-4 (via annotation refinement/generation). Regarding multi-source generalization, the proposed VisualCritic- $M$ performs better on the target datasets, attaining $0.024 / 0.028,0.062 / 0.050,0.065 / 0.047,0.078 / 0.052$ improvements for the $K o n I Q-10 k \rightarrow K A D I D-10 k, K A D I D-10 k \rightarrow K o n I Q-10 k, L I V E C \rightarrow K A$

$D I D-10 k, K A D I D-10 k \rightarrow L I V E C$ settings on SRCC and PLCC, respectively, relative to the second best conventional IQA models. Compared to VisualCritic-S, the larger improvements achieved by VisualCritic- $M$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our adopted relativity learning on the joint utilization of different IQA datasets.

Quantitative results on other indicators. Besides the most commonly used indicator, i.e., MOS, we also report the quantitative results of our VisualCritic on other indicators in Table 4 to show its achieved versatility. Few publications report their performance on these indicators.

Ablation study on the training strategy. We conduct an ablation study on the proposed training strategy for VisualCritic, with the results presented

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9cf0b5f2af2a988353a9g-12.jpg?height=46&width=1215&top_left_y=1603&top_left_x=455)
to build VisualCritic with a joint learning over different datasets. Nevertheless, it performs worse than MultiFunc single that is only trained on a single dataset, in terms of both within-dataset (on KonIQ-10k) or cross-dataset (on other datasets) quantitative performance. This observation experimentally reveals the inconformity issue in this field and indicates that "the inconformity starves generalization" as analyzed in Sec. 3.2. Moreover, we observe that the model Relat. + MultiFunc joint delivers clear improvements compared to the

to MultiFunc $c_{\text {single }}$. This experimental observation demonstrates the effectiveness of our applied relativity learning on utilizing diverse datasets with unaligned annotations in building an IQA generalist. In specific, converting the absolute scores in each dataset into the judgements of relative quality can effectively make the model training free of the effects of the inconsistency in the original annotations of different datasets. Furthermore, the model Relat. + MultiFunc single performs the best across all model variants, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed training strategy for VisualCritic. This experimental phenomenon
provides an insight that the annotation inconsistency over different datasets inevitably affects the results of multifunctional training (Stage-2) as well. In the following, we study the effects of choosing different datasets when performing multifunctional training on the final results.

Ablation study on the dataset choice. Actually, in Table 2, only the performance on the KonIQ-10k dataset could not be affected much by the annotation inconformity issue across different datasets. For other datasets except KonIQ$10 \mathrm{k}$, we only utilize the relativity of their data annotations for the Stage-1 training, without using their absolute numerical values. Therefore, the performance on these datasets could be considered to reflect a certain degree of generalization. Here, we zoom into the effects of the dataset choice used for the training of quantitative measurement in the Stage-2, denoted by the "Source" in the Table 6. As the results show in Table 6, for each test dataset denoted by "Target", the highest performance is reached when its corresponding training set is used for the training of quantitative measurement in the Stage-2. We find the data configuration in Table 1 achieves the best trade-off between different datasets when tackling the aforementioned annotation inconformity issue. Additionally, partially combining some of them for a joint training, instead of using them all, for MultiFunc $c_{\text {joint }}$ in Table 5 is not the research focus of this work, we provide some results in the supplementary.

### 4.3 Qualitative Results

We show the qualitative results in Figure 1. From this case study, we can find that our proposed VisualCritic exhibits impressive instruction following capability with more detailed and pertinent descriptions compared to other LMMs, when being asked to assess the visual quality of the given image. In addition, other LMMs all misjudge the given AI-generated image as a photographic one while our VisualCritic makes the correct judgment. Besides these performances, VisualCritic also minimizes the generation of hallucinations and actively admits its unknown or uncertain judgments. More related qualitative results and their corresponding analysis are placed in our supplementary.

Quantitative evaluation of the linguistic outputs of LMMs remains an underresolved issue so far. The common compromise solution is to employ a more advanced LMM (e.g., GPT-4V) as a critic for evaluating other models. But this is not adaptable to this work since our proposed model is at the forefront in this field. To address this issue as possible, we conduct a human side-by-side evaluation where 10 users are employed for comparing ours with 4 other LMMs on 100 random samples. The $\mathrm{G}+\mathrm{S} / \mathrm{S}+\mathrm{B}$ scores (where Good: our VisualCritic

preferred, Same: no preference, Bad: other model preferred) are as shown in Table 7

### 4.4 Prompts for Data Construction

As introduced in Sec. 3.2 we prompt GPT-4 to automatically construct training data from public datasets with human subjective ratings, avoiding substantial manual annotation costs. The training data adopt a unified format as introduced in Sec. 3.2, where $\{$ img_content $\}$, \{instruction_content $\}$ and \{answer_content $\}$ are three placeholders of the tokens of input image, user instruction and VisualCritic's response, respectively. The prompts to generate VisualCritic's response (i.e., \{answer_content\}) are illustrated in Figure 3 which are categorized into four segments, each corresponding to different image assessment functionalities task we investigate in Sec. 3.2. In the supplementary, we provide additional prompts tailored for generating user instruction (i.e., $\{$ instruction_content $\}$ ).

## 5 Conclusion

In this work, we explore the question: Can LMMs perceive low-level visual quality aligned with human perception and show their excellent generalization ability in this regard? We provide an answer with VisualCritic, the first LMM of its kind for broad-spectrum image subjective quality assessment. Compared to
conventional specialist models in the field of visual quality assessment, VisualCritic exhibits unprecedented cross-dataset generalizability and versatility. Beyond numerical scores, VisualCritic can further provide qualitative descriptions about visual quality and perform authenticity detection. We pinpoint the key to VisualCritic and introduce the core strategies on data construction and model training for making it real. We leave its extension to more data like videos and more functionalities in the future exploration. We also look forward to exploring its interplay with AIGC models for achieving better visual alignment.

#### Abstract

In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to enhance blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models for social media videos. Motivated by previous researches that leverage pre-trained features extracted from various computer vision models as the feature representation for BVQA, we further explore rich quality-aware features from pretrained blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models as auxiliary features to help the BVQA model to handle complex distortions and diverse content of social media videos. Specifically, we use SimpleVQA, a BVQA model that consists of a trainable Swin Transformer-B and a fixed SlowFast, as our base model. The Swin Transformer$B$ and SlowFast components are responsible for extracting spatial and motion features, respectively. Then, we extract three kinds of features from Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA to capture frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. Through concatenating these features, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three public social media VQA datasets. Moreover, the proposed model won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/sunwei925/RQ-VQA.git.


## 1. Introduction

Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) [27] aims to provide a perceptual quality score of the video without access to any reference information (i.e., high-quality source videos), which has increasingly played a crucial role in video processing systems of steaming media applications, ensuring that end-users can view high-quality videos and have a superior Quality of Experience (QoE). Towards[^0]

this goal, numerous BVQA models have been proposed to achieve better correlation with human subjective opinions, including knowledge-driven models [12,35,43,44] and data-driven models [14,15, 19,38-40,51,58,59].

Although knowledge-driven BVQA models [5, 12, 35, 43, 44] have better interpretability, they often exhibit relatively poor performance and higher computational complexity compared to data-driven approaches, mainly due to complex human perception processes involved in assessing visual quality. With the rapid development of deep neural network (DNN), data-driven BVQA models have demonstrated excellent performance on various kinds of videos, including professionally generated content (PGC) videos with synthetic distortions [23] and user-generated content (UGC) videos with realistic distortions [19,38,49,51].

The success of data-driven BVQA models can be attributed to two factors. The first is the adoption of more advanced neural networks, including convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods (e.g., VSFA [15], SimpleVQA [38], Li22 [14], etc.), Transformer-based methods (e.g. StarVQA [57], FAST-VQA [51], etc.), and recent large multi-modality (LLM)-based methods (e.g. QAlign [56]). The second is the construction of large-scale subjective labeled video quality assessment (VQA) datasets (e.g., LSVQ [59], etc.), enabling the DNN models learn quality-aware feature representation from the videos and the corresponding quality labels.

As data-driven methods, the performance of BVQA models relies heavily on the human-rated VQA datasets. However, the videos in current mainstreaming VQA datasets [9, 10, 33, 37, 48, 59] were typically captured by outdated cameras or collected from video sharing websites several years ago. The distortion types and video content may not align with the videos in current streaming video applications especially social media applications, as the shooting devices and video processing algorithms including pre-processing, compression, and enhancement algorithms, have greatly improved. Therefore, the BVQA model trained by these VQA datasets may not have sufficient capability to evaluate the perceptual quality of the millions of newly social media videos uploaded daily.

Figure 1. The comparison of PGC videos, UGC videos, and the processed UGC videos.

In this paper, we focus on BVQA models for social media videos ${ }^{1}$, which exhibit two distinct characteristics: 1) the video content usually includes lots of special effects, text descriptions, subtitled, etc., 2) the videos undergo complex processing workflows including pre-processing, transcoding, and enhancement. We show some typical social media videos in Figure 1.

In the literature, Sun et al. propose a BVQA framework named SimpleVQA, comprising a trainable spatial quality module and a fixed temporal quality module, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This framework shows excellent extensibility in accommodating various scenarios, including surveillance video quality assessment [62] and point cloud quality assessment [63], etc. Moreover, Zhang et al. [65] extract geometry features (i.e., dihedral angle, gaussian curvature, and NSS parameters) of the mesh of digital human and integrated them into the SimpleVQA framework to assess the quality of dynamic digital human. Wen et al. [50] propose a spatial rectifier and temporal rectifier within the SimpleVQA framework to address variable spatial resolution and frame rate video quality assessment problems. These studies indicate that with proper quality-aware features, SimpleVQA can effectively handle various types of quality assessment problems.

Therefore, we also resort to the SimpleVQA framework to address the social media BVQA problem. Given the diverse content of social media videos and the variety of video processing algorithms they undergo, training SimpleVQA end-to-end may require a large-scale of VQA datasets to achieve the robust quality feature representation, while the newest social media VQA dataset, KVQ [24], comprises only 3,600 quality-labeled videos. Inspired by prior[^1]

works $[50,65]$, we enhance SimpleVQA with rich qualityaware features derived from state-of-the-art blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models, which helps to alleviate the model's reliance on training data and improve its robustness.

To be more specific, we choose two BIQA models, LIQE [61] and Q-Align [56], and one BVQA model, FASTVQA [51], to extract frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. LIQE and Q-Align are both vision-language based BIQA models. For LIQE, we use the textual template: " $a$ photo of $a(n)\{s\}$ with $\{d\}$ artifacts, which is of $\{c\}$ quality" and calculate the cosine similarity between the visual embedding of the test image and the textual embedding of the text prompt. The parameters " $s$ ", " $d$ ", and " $c$ " belong to nine scene categories, eleven distortion types, and five distortion levels respectively, and total 495 text prompts are tested to derive 495 dimensional LIQE features. For QAlign, we use the conversation formats: "\#User: 〈 image \rangle How would you rate the quality of this image? \#Assistant: The quality of the image is $\langle$ level $\rangle . "$, where $\langle$ image \rangle and $\langle$ level $\rangle$ denote the image token and image quality level respectively. We extract Q-Align features by computing the hidden embedding of the last encoder layer. FASTVQA features are computed by global average pooling the last-stage feature maps. Then, we use Swin Transformer$\mathrm{B}$ [21] as the spatial quality analyzer and the temporal pathway of the SlowFast [6] network as the temporal quality analyzer. To further enhance the spatial feature representation, we add a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) [45] after the feature maps extracted by the Swin Transformer-B to capture salience information and guide the spatial feature extraction. Finally, we concatenate the SimpleVQA features (including both spatial and temporal features), LIQE features, Q-Align features, and FAST-VQA features and
regress them into video quality scores by a two-layer multilayer perception (MLP) network. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PLCC) loss is used to optimize the entire BVQA model. Our model achieves the best performance on three UGC VQA datasets and achieve the first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge [16].

The core contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We enhance the SimpleVQA framework with three kinds of quality-aware pre-trained features, yielding outstanding performance on social media UGC VQA datasets and also exhibiting remarkable robustness and generalizability.
- We utilize the MHSA module to capture the salience frame regions that influence the visual quality, thereby enhancing the fine-grained quality assessment capabilities.


## 2. Related Work

### 2.1. VQA Datasets

Early VQA datasets primarily focus on synthetic distortions introduced by different video processing stages, such as spatiotemporal downsampling [13, 18, 25, 26, 32], compression [3, 18, 36, 47], transmission [2, 4, 8, 31], etc. These datasets typically consist of a limited number of high-quality source videos and the corresponding distorted ones. Due to limited video content and not considering the realistic distortions, these datasets are not suitable for training general BVQA models. Therefore, recent VQA datasets $[9,10,33,37,48,59$ ] have shifted focus towards realistic captured distortions. For example, LIVE-Qualcomm [9] consists of 208 videos captured by 8 smartphones across 54 unique scenes. LIVE-VQC [37] includes 585 videos captured by 80 mobile cameras, encompassing different lighting conditions and diverse levels of motion, each video corresponding to a unique scene. LSVQ [59] consists of 38,811 videos sampled from the Internet Archive and YFCC100M datasets by matching six video feature distributions. In general, These datasets have greatly promoted the development of objective BVQA models.

However, for videos on social media platforms like Kwai and TikTok, their quality is influenced by both in-captured distortions and distortions caused by video processing algorithms. Hence, some studies have started to construct social media VQA datasets. For instance, Li et al. [17] selected 50 source videos from TikTok and then two encoders (i.e. H. 264 and H.265) were used to compress each video with five QPs to simulate the video transcoding procedure. Yu et al. [60] sampled 55 1080p videos from LIVEVQC [37], downscaled them to four different resolutions, and subsequently compressed using H. 264 across 17 compression levels. To streamline the human study, a sampling strategy was employed to select 220 represented distorted video for the subjective VQA study. Zhang et al. [64] constructed the TaoLive dataset, containing 418 raw videos from the TaoLive platform and 3, 762 distorted videos compressed at 8 different CRF levels using H.265. Gao et al. [7] studied the impact of video enhancement algorithms on UGC videos and constructed the VDPVE dataset, which includes 184 low-quality videos and 1,211 videos enhanced by light/contrast/color, deblurring, stabilization algorithms. Wu et al. [53] introduced the MaxWell dataset with 4,543 videos labeled with multi-attribute scores on 16 dimensions. Lu et al. [24] introduced the KVQ dataset to further study the impact of complete video processing workflows, including pre-processing, transcoding, and enhancement, on video quality. The dataset consists of 600 user-upload social media videos and 3,600 processed videos.

In this paper, we focus on quality assessment for UGC videos processed by multiple video processing algorithms (called social media videos in this paper), which is more challenging to BVQA models because of their diverse distortions introduced during both capture and video editing/processing stages.

### 2.2. BVQA Models

As stated in Section 1, we can roughly divide the BVQA models into knowledge-driven methods and data-driven methods.

Knowledge-driven BVQA models [5,12,29,35,43,44] utilize carefully designed handcrafted features to quantify the video quality. For example, V-BLIINDS [35] utilizes spatiotemporal natural scene statistics (NSS) models to quantify the NSS features of frame differences and motion coherency characteristics, and then regresses these features to video scores by support vector regressor (SVR). Mittal et al. [29] propose a training-free blind VQA model named VIIDEO that exploits intrinsic statistics regularities of natural videos to quantify disturbances introduced due to distortions. TLVQM [12] extracts rich spatiotemporal features such as motion, jerkiness, blurriness, noise, blockiness, color, etc. from both high and low complexity levels. VIDEVAL [43] employs the sequential forward floating selection strategy to choose a set of quality-aware features from typical BI/VQA methods, followed by training an SVR model to regress them into the video quality. TLVQM and VIDEVAL demonstrate that leveraging rich qualityaware handcrafted features enables the BVQA model to achieve better performance. In this paper, we show that combining diverse quality-aware features extracted from DNNs with a base BVQA model (e.g. SimpleVQA) can also achieve superior performance. .

Data-driven BVQA methods $[14,15,19,20,38,40,49,51$,

58, 59] mainly leverage DNNs to extract the quality-aware features. For instance, Liu et al. [20] introduce a multi-task BVQA model, optimizing the 3D-CNN for quality assessment and compression distortion classification simultaneously. VSFA [15] first extracts semantic features from a pre-trained CNN model, followed by utilizing a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to capture the temporal relationship among the semantic features of video frames. Yi et al. [58] propose an attention mechanism based BVQA model, which employs a non-local operator to handle uneven spatial distortion problems. Ying et al. [59] introduce a local-to-global region-based BVQA model, combing the quality-aware features extracted from a BIQA pre-trained and spatiotemporal features from a pre-trained action recognition network. Li et al. [14] also employ the IQA model pre-trained on multiple databases to extract quality-aware spatial features and the action recognition model to extract temporal features, subsequently utilizing a GRU network is used to regress spatial and temporal features into the quality scores. Sun et al. $[38,40]$ propose SimpleVQA, a BVQA framework that consists of a trainable spatial feature extraction module and a pre-trained motion feature extraction model. In this paper, we adopt SimpleVQA as our base model. Wu et al. [51] propose FAST-VQA, which samples spatio-temporal grid mini-cubes from original videos and trains a fragment attention network consisting of a Swin transformer and the gated relative position biases in an endto-end manner. Wu et al. [52] further propose DOVER, which integrates FAST-VQA with an aesthetics quality assessment branch to evaluate video quality from both technique and aesthetics perspectives. With the popularity of large multi-modality models (LMMs), some LMM-based quality assessment models [11,54-56] have been proposed to evaluate the image/video quality by providing predefined text prompts to LMMs.

Recently, there have been efforts to integrate various types of DNN features to enhance BVQA performance and provide explainability. For example, Wang et al. [49] propose a feature-rich BVQA model that assesses quality from three aspects including compression level, video content, and distortion type, with each aspect evaluated by a separate neural network. Liu et al. [19] extract seven types of features extracted by EfficientNet-b7 [41], ir-CSN-152 [42], CLIP [34], Swin Transformer-B [21], TimeSformer [1], Video Swin Transformer-B [22], and SlowFast [6] to represent content-aware, distortion-aware, and motion-aware features of videos. They incorporate these quality representations as supplementary supervisory information to train a lightweight BVQA model in a knowledge manner. These studies demonstrate the potential for BVQA models to benefit from various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we further demonstrate that BVQA models can achieve better performance with quality-aware pre-trained features.

## 3. Proposed Model

As depicted in Figure 2, our BVQA model builds upon SimpleVQA, incorporating Swin Transformer-B for learning spatial quality feature representation and leveraging the temporal path of SlowFast for modeling motion characteristics. We integrate three kinds of quality-aware features including LIQE, Q-Align, and FAST-VQA into SimpleVQA to enhance its quality-aware feature representation, thereby improving its capability to handle complex distortions of social media videos introduced during capture and video editing/processing procedures.

### 3.1. Video Pre-processing

Given a video $\boldsymbol{x}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, where $\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ represents the $i$-th frame. Here, $H$ and $W$ denote the height and the width of each frame respectively, and $N$ is the total number of frames. The features extracted by our method can be categorized into three levels: spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal. Therefore, we partition the video into three parts: key frames, video chunks, and the entire video. For key frames, we sample the first frame of every one-second video frame sequence as the key frame, denoted as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{z} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right\}_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \\
N_{z} & =N / r  \tag{1}\\
\boldsymbol{z}_{i} & =\boldsymbol{x}_{i * r}
\end{align*}
$$

where $r$ represents the frame rate of the video $\boldsymbol{x}$. For video chunks, we split the video $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a series of video chunks:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{V} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)}\right\}_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \\
\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{s}\right\}_{s=i * r}^{(i+1) * r-1} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Specifically, each key frame corresponds to one video chunk. For the entire video, the video $\boldsymbol{x}$ is directly used as the input.

### 3.2. The Base Model

We adopt SimpleVQA [38] as our base model, which utilizes a trainable spatial quality analyzer to extract spatial quality-ware features and employs a fixed temporal quality analyzer to capture motion features. Recent study [40] suggests that most VQA datasets are dominated by spatial distortions and pose little challenge to the temporal quality analyzer. Therefore, we choose a high-performance backbone Swin Transformer-B [21] as our spatial quality analyzer. We drop out the classification head of Swin TransformerB and add a MHSA module [45] to guide the spatial quality analyzer to focus on salience regions of video frames that affect video quality. We finally apply global average pooling to obtain the spatial quality representation. We denote these procedures as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\operatorname{MHSA}\left(\operatorname{SwinB}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right)\right)\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_c4e7ba2112ab6606b875g-05.jpg?height=732&width=1678&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=213)

Figure 2. The framework of the proposed BVQA model. We use SimpleVQA as the base model, which consists of a Swin Transformer-B and a SlowFast. We extract three quality-aware features using LIQE, Q-Align, and FAST-VQA as the auxiliary features. These features are then concatenated and regressed into the quality score via a MLP network.

where GP, MHSA, and SwinB represent global average pooling, MHSA module, and Swin Transformer-B without the classification head operators. $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}$ is the spatial features of $i$-th key frames.

The temporal quality analyzer is designed to extract video motion information, which is important for detecting distortions such as jitter caused by unstable shooting equipment or lagging resulting from low bandwidth during streaming. Following the approaches [38,40], we use the fast pathway of SlowFast to extract motion features for each video chunk. We also remove the classification head of SlowFast and calculate the temporal features by global average pooling the last-stage feature maps:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\operatorname{SlowFast}\left(\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where SlowFast denotes the SlowFast without the classification head. $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}$ is the temporal features of $i$-th video chunk.

### 3.3. LIQE Features

LIQE is a multi-task learning based visual-language model for BIQA. It employs the CLIP model, including an image encoder and a text encoder, to compute the cosine similarity between text features and image features. Specifically, it can take a text prompt $t(s, d, c)=$ "a photo of a $(n)$ $\{s\}$ with $\{d\}$ artifacts, which is of $\{c\}$ quality" and an image as the inputs, and calculate the cosine similarity between text features and image features as the probabilities to represent how well that the text prompt describes the test image. Subsequently, the probabilities can be used to infer the scene type, artifact type, and quality level of the test image.
Therefore, we utilize the probabilities from different types of text prompts as the features to represent the scene, artifact, and quality-level characteristics of video frames. Here, we consider nine scene categories: $s \in S=$ \{"animal", "cityscape", "human", "indoor scene", "landscape", "night scene", "plant", "still-life", and "others"\}, eleven distortion types: $d \in D=\{$ "blur", "color-related", "contrast", "JPEG compression", "JPEG2000 compression", "noise", "overexposure", "quantization", "underexposure", "spatially-localized", and "others"\}, and five quality levels: $c \in C=\{1,2,3,4,5\}=\{$ "bad", "poor", "fair", "good", "perfect" $\}$. So, in total, we have 495 text prompt candidates to compute the probabilities:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}=\operatorname{LIQE}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, \boldsymbol{t}(\boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{d}, \boldsymbol{c})\right)\right) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}$ represents the LIQE features of $i$-th key frames, which comprises 495 dimensions corresponding to the scene category, artifact type, and quality level characteristics.

### 3.4. Q-Align Features

Q-Align is a large multi-modality model designed for quality assessment tasks. Specifically, Q-Align is pretrained on multiple large-scale image/video quality assessment databases. The quality labels of the databases are first transformed into qualitative adjective descriptions (excellent, good, fair, poor, bad) and are then integrated into question-answer pairs for instruction fine-tuning of Q-Align. After training, Q-Align operates by taking in the prompt of "How is the quality of this image? |img|

The quality of the image is [SCORE_TOKEN]", where [SCORE_TOKEN] is the quality rating token responded by Q-Align and [SCORE_TOKEN] can be translated into the $\log$ probabilities to the predefined qualitative adjective descriptions.

However, to form a more comprehensive quality representation from the $\mathrm{Q}$-Align perspective, we extract the feature map from the last hidden layer of Q-Align rather than [SCORE_TOKEN] for analysis, which can be derived as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q}-\mathrm{Align}}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\mathrm{Q}-\operatorname{Align}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right)\right) \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q} \text {-Align }} \in R^{1 \times 4096}$ stands for the $\mathrm{Q}$-Align features of the $i$-th key frame, Q-Align $(\cdot)$ denotes the Q-Align last hidden layer feature map extraction process.

### 3.5. FAST-VQA Features

FAST-VQA is an efficient algorithm specially designed for BVQA. It notices that videos contain a high degree of spatio-temporal redundancy, and correspondingly proposes a grid mini-cude sampling (GMS) algorithm to pre-sample the video data before feeding them to the backbone, i.e. Video Swin Transformer Tiny (VSwin-T) [22] . For video as $\boldsymbol{x}$, the sampled fragments $\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{f}\right.$ ) are formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left.\boldsymbol{x}_{i,\left[u \times S_{f}\right.}^{f}:(u+1) \times S_{f}, v \times S_{f}:(v+1) \times S_{f}\right]  \tag{7}\\
= & \left.\operatorname{RCrop}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i,\left[\frac{u \times H}{G_{f}}\right.}: \frac{(u+1) \times H}{G_{f}}, \frac{v \times W}{G_{f}}: \frac{(v+1) \times W}{G_{f}}\right], s_{f}\right) \tag{8}
\end{align*}
$$

The fragments are then fed into the VSwin-T to obtain the FAST-VQA features:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}=\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{f}\right) \tag{9}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this method, we extract FAST-VQA features pretrained from the LSVQ [59] database.

### 3.6. Quality Regression

After calculating these features, we concatenate these features into the final feature representation $\mathcal{F}_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathcal{F}_{i}=\operatorname{Cat}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q}-\mathrm{Align}}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}\right) \\
& \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}=\mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}} \tag{10}
\end{align*}
$$

where Cat is the concatenation operator.

We then use a two-layer MLP network to regress $\mathcal{F}_{i}$ into local quality scores $\hat{q}_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{q}_{i}=\operatorname{MLP}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}\right) \tag{11}
\end{equation*}
$$

where MLP denotes the MLP operator and $\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ is the quality score of $i$-th frame/chunk. We use the average pooling method to derive the global quality score $\hat{q}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{q}=\frac{1}{N_{z}} \sum_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \hat{q}_{i} \tag{12}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.7. Loss Function

Similar to $[40,51]$, we use the PLCC loss to optimize the proposed BVQA model:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}=\left(1-\frac{\langle\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}-\operatorname{mean}(\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}), \boldsymbol{q}-\operatorname{mean}(\boldsymbol{q})\rangle}{\|\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}-\operatorname{mean}(\hat{\boldsymbol{q}})\|_{2}\|\boldsymbol{q}-\operatorname{mean}(\boldsymbol{q})\|_{2}}\right) / 2 \tag{13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}$ are the vectors of ground-truth and predicted quality scores of the images in a batch respectively, $\langle\cdot\rangle$ represents the inner product of two vectors, $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the norm operator for a vector, and mean is the average operator for a vector.

## 4. Experiment

### 4.1. Experimental Protocol

Test Datasets. We test our model on three VQA datasets: KVQ [24], TaoLive [64], and LIVE-WC [60], all of which focus on assessing the quality of streaming UGC videos. For KVQ, we train our model on the publicly released data from NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge ${ }^{2}$ and subsequently test the trained model on both validation and test sets. For TaoLive and LIVEWC, we conduct random splits of the videos with an $80 \%$ - $20 \%$ train-test ratio based on the video scenes, and repeat this process five times and report the average performance.

Implementation Details. As stated in Section 3, we utilize Swin Transformer-B [21] and SlowFast R50 [6] as the backbones of the spatial and temporal quality analyzers in the basic model. To improve the generalization ability of the basic model, we first train it on the LSVQ dataset [59], following the training strategy in [40]. Regarding the spatial quality analyzer, we resize the resolution of the minimum dimension of key frames as 384 while preserving their aspect ratios. During the training and test stages, the key frames are randomly and centrally cropped with a resolution of $384 \times 384$. As for the temporal quality analyzer, the resolution of the video chunks is resized to $224 \times 224$ without respecting the aspect ratio. For LIQE, Q-Align, and FASTVQA, we adhere to the original setups of these methods without making any alterations to extract the corresponding features. The Adam optimizer with the initial learning rate $1 \times 10^{-5}$ and batch size 6 is used to train the proposed model on a server with 2 NVIDIA RTX 3090. We decay the learning rate by a factor of 10 after 10 epochs and the total number of epochs is set as 30 .

Compared Models. We compare the proposed method with eight typical BVQA methods, including four knowledge-driven methods: NIQE [30], TLVQM [12], VIDEVAL [43], and RAPIQUE [44], and four data-driven methods: VSFA [15], SimpleVQA [38], FAST-VQA [52],[^2]

and Q-Align [56]. Except for Q-Align, we train other BVQA models for fair comparison.

Evaluation Criteria. We employ two criteria to evaluate the performance of VQA models: PLCC and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC). Note that PLCC assesses the prediction linearity of the VQA model, while SRCC evaluates the prediction monotonicity. An outstanding VQA model should achieve SRCC and PLCC values close to 1 . Before computing PLCC, we adhere to the procedure outlined in [46] to map model predictions to MOSs by a monotonic four-parameter logistic function to compensate for prediction nonlinearity.

### 4.2. Experimental Results

We list the experimental results in Table 1, from which we can obtain several conclusions. First, it is evident that all knowledge-driven methods perform poorly on three social media VQA datasets, suggesting that they lack the capability to effectively evaluate the quality of social media videos. Second, the proposed model achieves the best performance on both the KVQ and LIVE-WC datasets, surpassing competing BVQA methods by a substantial margin. This demonstrates that by incorporating rich quality-aware features, the proposed model has more powerful feature rep-

resentation capabilities for the complex BVQA task (e.g., BVQA for social media videos). Third, we observe that the proposed model achieves similar performance to SimpleVQA on TaoLive but outperforms other methods. The possible reason is that the videos in TaoLive mainly contain front-faces with diverse backgrounds. Moreover, the video processing method adopted in TaoLive only includes compression, which makes it simpler compared to the other two datasets. Therefore, even in the absence of diverse qualityaware features, SimpleVQA can still achieve state-of-theart performance, which also demonstrates the rationality of using SimpleVQA as the base model.

We also list the results of NTIRE Challenge in Table 2. To improve the robustness, we randomly split the public training set of KVQ with an $80 \%-20 \%$ ten times and use the ensemble results to compute the model performance. From Table 2, it is shown that the proposed model significantly outperforms other competing teams.

### 4.3. Ablation Studies

In this section, we investigate the effectiveness of features used in the proposed model. Specifically, we ablate Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA features from the proposed model respectively, and test them on the KVQ test set. The
experimental results are listed in Table 3. From Table 3, it is evident that regardless of which features are ablated, there is a performance degradation. When all features are integrated, the proposed model achieves the highest performance, which validates the effectiveness of extracted features.

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we attempt to enhance BVQA models with diverse quality-aware features and propose a strong BVQA model for social media videos. We use SimpleVQA as the base BVQA model and extract three kinds of qualityaware features from two BIQA models, LIQE and Q-Align, and one BVQA model, FAST-VQA. We simply concatenate these features with SimpleVQA and then regress them into the video quality score via a MLP network. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three social media VQA datasets.
