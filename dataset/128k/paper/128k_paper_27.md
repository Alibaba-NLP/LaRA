In the past year, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have undergone substantial advancements, augmenting off-the-shelf LLMs to support MM inputs or outputs via cost-effective training strategies. The resulting models not only preserve the inherent reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs but also empower a diverse range of MM tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of MM-LLMs. Initially, we outline general design formulations for model architecture and training pipeline. Subsequently, we introduce a taxonomy encompassing 126 MM-LLMs, each characterized by its specific formulations. Furthermore, we review the performance of selected MM-LLMs on mainstream benchmarks and summarize key training recipes to enhance the potency of MM-LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for MM-LLMs while concurrently maintaining a real-time tracking website ${ }^{1}$ for the latest developments in the field. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the MM-LLMs domain.


## 1 Introduction

MultiModal (MM) pre-training research has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, consistently pushing the performance boundaries across a spectrum of downstream tasks (Li et al., 2020; Akbari et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Zellers et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022b; Yang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a,b). However, as the scale of models and datasets continues to expand, traditional MM models incur substantial computational costs, particularly when trained[^0]

from scratch. Recognizing that MM research operates at the intersection of various modalities, a logical approach is to capitalize on readily available pre-trained unimodal foundation models, with a special emphasis on powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2022). This strategy aims to mitigate computational expenses and enhance the efficacy of MM pre-training, leading to the emergence of a novel field: MM-LLMs.

MM-LLMs harness LLMs as the cognitive powerhouse to empower various MM tasks. LLMs contribute desirable properties like robust language generation, zero-shot transfer capabilities, and In-Context Learning (ICL). Concurrently, foundation models in other modalities provide highquality representations. Considering foundation models from different modalities are individually pre-trained, the core challenge facing MM-LLMs is how to effectively connect LLMs with models in other modalities to enable collaborative inference. The predominant focus within this field has
been on refining alignment between modalities and aligning with human intent via a MM Pre-Training (PT) + MM Instruction-Tuning (IT) pipeline.

With the debut of GPT-4(Vision) (OpenAI, 2023) and Gemini (Team et al., 2023), showcasing impressive MM understanding and generation capabilities, a research fervor on MM-LLMs has been sparked. Initial research primarily focuses on MM content comprehension and text generation, encompassing tasks such as image-text understanding, exemplified by projects like BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023e), LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023e), MiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023a), and OpenFlamingo (Awadalla et al., 2023); video-text understanding, as demonstrated by initiatives such as VideoChat (Li et al., 2023f), Video-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023), and LLaMA-VID (Li et al., 2023j); and audio-text understanding, as seen in projects like QwenAudio (Chu et al., 2023b). Later, the capabilities of MM-LLMs have been expanded to support specific modality outputs. This includes tasks with image-text output, such as GILL (Koh et al., 2023a), Kosmos-2 (Peng et al., 2023), Emu (Sun et al., 2024), and MiniGPT-5 (Zheng et al., 2023b); as well as speech/audio-text output, exemplified by projects like SpeechGPT (Zhang et al., 2023a) and AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023). Recent research endeavors have focused on mimicking human-like any-to-any modality conversion, shedding light on the path to artificial general intelligence. Some efforts aim to amalgamate LLMs with external tools to reach an approaching any-to-any MM comprehension and generation, such as VisualChatGPT (Wu et al., 2023a), HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), and AudioGPT (Huang et al., 2023b). Conversely, to mitigate propagated errors in the cascade system, initiatives like NExT-GPT (Wu et al., 2023d), CoDi-2 (Tang et al., 2023c), and ModaVerse (Wang et al., 2024d) have developed end-to-end MM-LLMs of arbitrary modalities. The timeline of MM-LLMs is depicted in Figure 1.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of MM-LLMs. To provide readers with a holistic understanding of MM-LLMs, we initially delineate general design formulations from model architecture (Section 2) and training pipeline (Section 3). We break down the general model architecture into five components: Modality Encoder (Section 2.1), Input Projector (Section 2.2), LLM Backbone (Section 2.3), Output Projector (Section 2.4), and Modality Generator (Section 2.5). The training pipeline elu- cidates how to enhance a pre-trained text-only LLM to support MM input or output, primarily consisting of two stages: MM PT (Section 3.1) and MM IT (Section 3.2). In that section, we also provide a summary of mainstream datasets for MM PT and MM IT. Next, we establish a taxonomy encompassing 126 State-of-the-Art (SOTA) MM-LLMs, each characterized by specific formulations, and summarize their development trends in Section 4. In Section 5, we comprehensively review the performance of major MM-LLMs on mainstream benchmarks and distill key training recipes to enhance the efficacy of MM-LLMs. In Section 6, we offer promising directions for MMLLMs research. Moreover, we have established a website (https://mm-llms.github.io) to track the latest progress of MM-LLMs and facilitate crowdsourcing updates. Finally, we summarize the entire paper in Section 7 and discuss related surveys on MM-LLMs in Appendix A. We aspire for our survey to aid researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of this field and to inspire the design of more effective MM-LLMs.

## 2 Model Architecture

In this section, we provide a detailed overview of the five components comprising the general model architecture, along with the implementation choices for each component, as illustrated in Figure 2. MM-LLMs that emphasize MM understanding only include the first three components. During training, Modality Encoder, LLM Backbone, and Modality Generator are generally maintained in a frozen state. The primary optimization emphasis is on Input and Output Projectors. Given that Projectors are lightweight components, the proportion of trainable parameters in MM-LLMs is notably small compared to the total parameter count (typically around $2 \%$ ). The overall parameter count is contingent on the scale of the core LLM utilized in the MM-LLMs. As a result, MM-LLMs can be efficiently trained to empower various MM tasks.

### 2.1 Modality Encoder

The Modality Encoder (ME) is tasked with encoding inputs from diverse modalities $I_{X}$ to obtain corresponding features $\boldsymbol{F}_{X}$, formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}_{X}=\operatorname{ME}_{X}\left(I_{X}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Various pre-trained encoder options $\mathrm{ME}_{X}$ exist for handling different modalities, where $X$ can be

Figure 2: The general model architecture of MM-LLMs and the implementation choices for each component.

image, video, audio, 3D, etc. Next, we will offer a concise introduction organized by modality.

Visual Modality For images, there are various optional encoders: NFNet-F6 (Brock et al., 2021), ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), CLIP ViT (Radford et al., 2021), Eva-CLIP ViT (Fang et al., 2023), BEiT-3 (Wang et al., 2023d), OpenCLIP (Cherti et al., 2023), Grounding-DINOT (Zhang et al., 2022b) with Swin-T (Liu et al., 2021b) backbone, DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023), SAM-HQ (Kirillov et al., 2023) with MAE (He et al., 2022), RAM++ (Zhang et al., 2023i) with Swin-B backbone, InternViT (Chen et al., 2023j), and VCoder (Jain et al., 2023). For videos, they can be uniformly sampled to 5 frames, undergoing the same pre-processing as images.

Audio Modality is typically encoded by CFormer (Chen et al., 2023b), HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), BEATs (Chen et al., 2023g), Whisper (Radford et al., 2023), and CLAP (Wu et al., 2023e).

3D Point Cloud Modality is typically encoded by ULIP-2 (Salesforce, 2022) with a PointBERT (Yu et al., 2022) backbone.

Moreover, to handle numerous heterogeneous modal encoders, some MM-LLMs, particularly any-to-any ones, use ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), a unified encoder covering six modalities, including image/video, text, audio, heat map, inertial measurement units, and depth. We provide a brief introduction to some mainstream modality encoders in Appendix B.

### 2.2 Input Projector

The Input Projector $\Theta_{X \rightarrow T}$ is tasked with aligning the encoded features of other modalities $\boldsymbol{F}_{X}$ with the text feature space $T$. The aligned features as prompts $\boldsymbol{P}_{X}$ are then fed into the LLM
Backbone alongside the textual features $\boldsymbol{F}_{T}$. Given $X$-text dataset $\left\{I_{X}, t\right\}$, the goal is to minimize the $X$-conditioned text generation loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text {txt-gen }}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\arg \min \mathcal{L}_{\text {txt-gen }}\left(\operatorname{LLM}\left(\boldsymbol{P}_{X}, \boldsymbol{F}_{T}\right), t\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{P}_{X}=\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{X \rightarrow T}\left(\boldsymbol{F}_{X}\right)$.

The Input Projector can be achieved directly by a Linear Projector or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), i.e., several linear projectors interleaved with non-linear activation functions. There are also more complex implementations like Cross-attention, Q-Former (Li et al., 2023e), PFormer (Jian et al., 2023), and MQ-Former (Lu et al., 2023a). Cross-attention (Perceiver Resampler) (Alayrac et al., 2022) uses a set of trainable vectors as queries and the encoded features $\boldsymbol{F}_{X}$ as keys to compress the feature sequence to a fixed length. The compressed representation is then fed directly into the LLM or further used for X-Text cross-attention fusion. Q-Former extracts relevant features from $\boldsymbol{F}_{X}$ with learnable queries, and the selected features are then used as prompts $\boldsymbol{P}_{X}$. Meanwhile, P-Former generates "reference prompts", imposing an alignment constraint on the prompts produced by Q-Former. MQ-Former conducts a fine-grained alignment of multi-scale visual and textual signals. However, both Q-, P-, MQ-Former require an additional PT process for initialization.

### 2.3 LLM Backbone

Taking LLMs (Zhao et al., 2023c; Naveed et al., 2023; Mo et al., 2024) as the core agents, MMLLMs can inherit some notable properties like zero-shot generalization, few-shot ICL, Chain-ofThought (CoT), and instruction following. The LLM Backbone processes representations from various modalities, engaging in semantic understanding, reasoning, and decision-making regarding the
inputs. It produces (1) direct textual outputs $t$, and (2) signal tokens $\boldsymbol{S}_{X}$ from other modalities (if any). These signal tokens act as instructions to guide the generator on whether to produce MM contents and, if affirmative, specifying the content to produce:

$$
\begin{equation*}
t, \boldsymbol{S}_{X}=\operatorname{LLM}\left(\boldsymbol{P}_{X}, \boldsymbol{F}_{T}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the aligned representations of other modalities $\boldsymbol{P}_{X}$ can be considered as soft Prompt-tuning for the LLM. Moreover, some works have introduced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Prefix-tuning (Li and Liang, 2021), LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), and LayerNorm tuning (Zhao et al., 2024). In these cases, the number of additional trainable parameters is exceptionally minimal, even less than $0.1 \%$ of the total LLM parameter count. We provide an introduction to mainstream PEFT methods in Appendix C.

The commonly used LLMs in MM-LLMs incude Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2022a), UL2 (Tay et al., 2022), Persimmon (Elsen et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022c), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). We provide a brief introduction to some representative LLMs in Appendix D.

### 2.4 Output Projector

The Output Projector $\Theta_{T \rightarrow X}$ maps the signal token representations $\boldsymbol{S}_{X}$ from the LLM Backbone into features $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}$ understandable to the following Modality Generator $\mathrm{MG}_{X}$. Given the $X$-text dataset $\left\{I_{X}, t\right\}, t$ is first fed into LLM to generate the corresponding $\boldsymbol{S}_{X}$, then mapped into $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}$. To facilitate alignment of the mapped features $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}$, the goal is to minimize the distance between $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}$ and the conditional text representations of $\mathrm{MG}_{X}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\underset{\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{T \rightarrow X}}{\arg \min } \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{mse}}\left(\boldsymbol{H}_{X}, \tau_{X}(t)\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

The optimization only relies on captioning texts, without utilizing any audio or visual resources $X$, where $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}=\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{T \rightarrow X}\left(\boldsymbol{S}_{X}\right)$ and $\tau_{X}$ is the textual condition encoder in $\mathrm{MG}_{X}$. The Output Projector is implemented by a Tiny Transformer with a learnable decoder feature sequence or MLP.

### 2.5 Modality Generator

The Modality Generator $\mathrm{MG}_{X}$ is tasked with producing outputs in distinct modalities. Commonly, existing works use off-the-shelf Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) (Song et al., 2021; Bao et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022), i.e., Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) for image synthesis, Zeroscope (Cerspense, 2023) for video synthesis, and AudioLDM$\mathbf{2}$ (Liu et al., 2023b,c) for audio synthesis. The features $\boldsymbol{H}_{X}$ mapped by the Output Projector serve as conditional inputs in the denoising process to generate MM content. During training, the ground truth content is first transformed into a latent feature $z_{0}$ by the pre-trained VAE (Kingma and Welling, 2013). Then, noise $\epsilon$ is added to $z_{0}$ to obtain the noisy latent feature $z_{t}$. A pre-trained Unet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) $\epsilon_{X}$ is used to compute the conditional LDM loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text {X-gen }}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{X} \text {-gen }}:=\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), t}\left\|\epsilon-\epsilon_{X}\left(z_{t}, t, \boldsymbol{H}_{X}\right)\right\|_{2}^{2} \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

which optimizes parameters $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{X \rightarrow T}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{T \rightarrow X}$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{X} \text {-gen }}$.

## 3 Training Pipeline

MM-LLMs' training pipeline can be delineated into two principal stages: MM PT and MM IT.

### 3.1 MM PT

During the PT stage, typically leveraging the XText datasets, Input and Output Projectors are trained to achieve alignment among various modalities by optimizing predefined objectives. For MM understanding models, optimization focuses solely on Equation (2), while for MM generation models, optimization involves Equations (2), (4), and (5). In the latter case, Equation (2) also includes the ground-truth signal token sequence.

The X-Text datasets include Image-Text, VideoText, and Audio-Text, with Image-Text having two types: Image-Text pairs (e.g., <img1> $<t x t 1>$ ) and interleaved Image-Text corpus (e.g., $<t x t 1><i m g 1><t x t 2><t x t 3><i m g 2><t x t 4>)$. Details of X-Text datasets are shown in Table 3.

### 3.2 MM IT

MM IT is a method that entails fine-tuning of pre-trained MM-LLMs using instruction-formatted datasets (Wei et al., 2021). Through this process, MM-LLMs can generalize to unseen tasks by adhering to new instructions, thereby enhancing zeroshot performance. This straightforward yet impactful concept has catalyzed subsequent success in the field of NLP, exemplified by works such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022), and InstructBLIP (Dai et al., 2023).

Figure 3: Taxonomy for MM-LLMs. I: Image, V: Video, A/S: Audio/Speech, and T: Text. $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{D}}$ : Document understanding, $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{B}}$ : Output bounding box, $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{M}}$ : Output segmentation mask, and $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{R}}$ : Output retrieved images.

MM IT comprises Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), aiming to align with human intents and enhance the interaction capabilities of MM-LLMs. SFT converts part of the PT stage data into an instruction-aware format. Using visual Question-Answer (QA) as an example, various templates may be employed like (1) "<Image $>\{$ Question\}" A short answer to the question is; (2) "<Image>" Examine the image and respond to the following question with a brief answer: "\{Question\}. Answer:"; and so on. Next, it finetunes pre-trained MM-LLMs using the same optimization objectives. SFT datasets can be structured as either single-turn QA or multi-turn dialogues.

After SFT, RLHF involves further fine-tuning of the model, relying on feedback regarding the MM-LLMs' responses (e.g., Natural Language
Feedback (NLF) labeled manually or automatically) (Sun et al., 2023b). This process employs a reinforcement learning algorithm to effectively integrate the non-differentiable NLF. The model is trained to generate corresponding responses conditioned on the NLF (Chen et al., 2023i; Akyürek et al., 2023). The statistics for SFT and RLHF datasets are presented in Table 4 of Appendix G.

The datasets used by existing MM-LLMs in the MM PT and MM IT stages are diverse, but they are all subsets of the datasets in Tables 3 and 4.

ing access to certain MM expert systems to perform specific MM tasks via reasoning, while "Endto-End" signifies that the entire model is trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Based on the previously defined design formulations, we also conduct a comprehensive comparison of the architectures and training dataset scales for 43 of these SOTA MM-LLMs, as illustrated in Table 1. Next, we will summarize their developmental trends and briefly introduce the core contributions of some representative models in Appendix E.

Trends in Existing MM-LLMs: (1) Progressing from a dedicated emphasis on MM understanding to the generation of specific modalities and further evolving into any-to-any modality conversion (e.g., MiniGPT-4 $\rightarrow$ MiniGPT-5 $\rightarrow$ NExT-GPT); (2) Advancing from MM PT to SFT and then to RLHF, the training pipeline undergoes continuous refinement, striving to better align with human intent and enhance the model's conversational interaction capabilities (e.g., BLIP-2 $\rightarrow$ InstructBLIP $\rightarrow$
DRESS); (3) Embracing Diversified Modal Extensions (e.g., BLIP-2 $\rightarrow$ X-LLM and InstructBLIP $\rightarrow$ X-InstructBLIP); (4) Incorporating a HigherQuality Training Dataset (e.g., LLaVA $\rightarrow$ LLaVA1.5); (5) Adopting a More Efficient Model Architecture, transitioning from complex Q- and P-Former input projector modules in BLIP-2 and DLP to a simpler yet effective linear projector in VILA.

OKVQA includes questions requiring reasoning with a variety of knowledge types such as commonsense, world knowledge, and visual knowledge. MiniGPT-v2 and MiniGPT-v2-chat perform best in this benchmark, showcasing their outstanding reasoning abilities. IconVQA emphasizes the importance of abstract diagram comprehension and holistic cognitive reasoning in real-world diagram-based word problems, requiring both perceptual acumen and versatile cognitive reasoning. MiniGPT-v2 and MiniGPT-v2-chat also excel in this benchmark, highlighting their exceptional perception and cognitive reasoning capabilities. $\mathrm{VQA}^{\mathrm{v} 2}$ is a more balanced VQA dataset where each question is paired with a series of images. VILA-13B performs best in this benchmark, demonstrating its superior ability to comprehend multimodal information and its resistance to language biases in the knowledge it acquires. GQA is a VQA dataset focusing on image scene graphs, offering impartial compositional questions derived from real-world images. Each question is associated with a structured representation of its meaning and the detailed logical steps required to answer it. LLaVA-1.5 and VILA-7B perform best in this benchmark, illustrating their excellent reasoning abilities in this domain.

Following this, we will outline training recipes that enhance the effectiveness of MM-LLMs, drawing insights from SOTA models.

Training Recipes Firstly, higher image resolution can incorporate more visual details for the model, benefiting tasks that require fine-grained details. For example, LLaVA-1.5 and VILA employ a resolution of $336 \times 336$, while Qwen-VL and MiniGPT-v2 utilize $448 \times 448$. However, higher resolutions lead to longer token sequences, incurring additional training and inference costs.
MiniGPT-v2 addresses this by concatenating 4 adjacent visual tokens in the embedding space to reduce length. Recently, Monkey (Li et al., 20231) proposed a solution to enhance the resolution of input images without retraining a high-resolution visual encoder, utilizing only a low-resolution visual encoder, supporting resolutions up to $1300 \times 800$. To enhance the understanding of rich-text images, tables, and document content, DocPedia (Feng et al., 2023) introduced a method to increase the visual encoder resolution to $2560 \times 2560$, overcoming the limitations of poorly performing low resolutions in open-sourced ViT. Secondly, the incorporation of high-quality SFT data can significantly improve performance in specific tasks, as evidenced by the addition of ShareGPT4V data to LLaVA-1.5 and VILA-13B, as shown in Table 2. Moreover, VILA reveals several key findings: (1) Performing PEFT on the LLM Backbone promotes deep embedding alignment, crucial for ICL; (2) Interleaved Image-Text data proves beneficial, whereas ImageText pairs alone are sub-optimal; (3) Re-blending text-only instruction data (e.g., unnatural instruction (Honovich et al., 2022)) with image-text data during SFT not only addresses the degradation of text-only tasks but also enhances VL task accuracy.

## 6 Future Directions

In this section, we explore promising future directions for MM-LLMs across the following aspects:

More General and Intelligent Models We can enhance the MM-LLMs' strength from the following four key avenues: (1) Expanding Modalities: Current MM-LLMs mainly support the following modalities: image, video, audio, 3D, and text. However, the real world involves a broader range of modalities. Extending MM-LLMs to accommodate
additional modalities (e.g., web pages, heat maps, and figures\&tables) will increase the model's versatility, making it more universally applicable; (2) Diversifying LLMs: Incorporating various types and sizes of LLMs provides practitioners with the flexibility to select the most appropriate one based on their specific requirements; (3) Improving MM IT Dataset Quality: Current MM IT datasets have ample room for improvement and expansion. Diversifying the range of instructions can enhance the effectiveness of MM-LLMs in understanding and executing user commands; (4) Strengthening MM Generation Capabilities: Most current MMLLMs are predominantly oriented towards MM understanding. Although some models have incorporated MM generation capabilities, the quality of generated responses may be constrained by the capacities of the LDMs. Exploring the integration of retrieval-based approaches (Asai et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023a; Kang et al., 2024) holds significant promise in complementing the generative process, enhancing the overall performance of the model.

More Challenging Benchmarks Existing benchmarks may not sufficiently challenge the capabilities of MM-LLMs, as many datasets have appeared to varying degrees in the PT or IT sets. This implies that the models might have already learned these tasks during training. Moreover, current benchmarks predominantly focus on the VL subfield. Therefore, it is crucial for the development of MM-LLMs to construct a more challenging, largerscale benchmark that includes additional modalities and employs a unified evaluation standard. For instance, GOAT-Bench (Lin et al., 2024b) is designed to assess the capability of various MMLLMs in discerning and responding to nuanced aspects of social abuse depicted in memes. MMCode (Li et al., 2024a) evaluates the algorithmic problem-solving skills of MM-LLMs in visually rich contexts. DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2024a) measures the trustworthiness of MM-LLMs. MathVista (Lu et al., 2024) evaluates the mathematical reasoning ability of MM-LLMs within visual contexts, while GeoEval (Zhang et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024f; Song et al., 2024) assesses their proficiency in tackling geometry math problems. Moreover, MMMU (Yue et al., 2023) and CMMMU (Zhang et al., 2024a) have respectively introduced English and Chinese versions of a comprehensive multidiscipline MM understanding and reasoning benchmark for expert artificial general intelligence. Ad- ditionally, Fan et al. have challenged MM-LLMs with multipanel VQA, and BenchLMM (Cai et al., 2023) benchmarks the cross-style visual capability of MM-LLMs. Furthermore, Liu et al. have conducted an in-depth study on the optical character recognition capabilities of MM-LLMs. These efforts highlight the need for more sophisticated and diverse benchmarks to truly gauge the advanced capabilities of MM-LLMs.

Mobile/Lightweight Deployment To deploy MM-LLMs on resource-constrained platforms and achieve optimal performance meanwhile, such as low-power mobile and IoT devices, lightweight implementations are of paramount importance. A notable advancement in this realm is MobileVLM (Chu et al., 2023a). This approach strategically downscales LLaMA, allowing for seamless off-the-shelf deployment. MobileVLM further introduces a lightweight downsample projector, consisting of fewer than 20 million parameters, contributing to improved computational speed. Recently, there have been many similar studies on lightweighting MM-LLMs, achieving efficient computation and inference with comparable performance or minimal loss, including TinyGPT-V (Yuan et al., 2023b), Vary-toy (Wei et al., 2024), Mobile-Agent (Wang et al., 2024c), MoE-LLaVA (Lin et al., 2024a), and MobileVLM V2 (Chu et al., 2024). Nevertheless, this avenue necessitates additional exploration for further advancements in development.

Embodied Intelligence The embodied intelligence aims to replicate human-like perception and interaction with the surroundings by effectively understanding the environment, recognizing pertinent objects, assessing their spatial relationships, and devising a comprehensive task plan (Firoozi et al., 2023). Embodied AI tasks, such as embodied planning, embodied visual question answering, and embodied control, equip robots to autonomously implement extended plans by leveraging real-time observations. Some typical works in this area are PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023) and EmbodiedGPT (Mu et al., 2023). PaLM-E introduces a multi-embodiment agent through the training of a MM-LLM. Beyond functioning solely as an embodied decision maker, PaLM-E also demonstrates proficiency in handling general VL tasks. EmbodiedGPT introduces an economically efficient method characterized by a CoT approach, enhancing the capability of embodied agents to engage
with the real world and establishing a closed loop that connects high-level planning with low-level control. While MM-LLM-based Embodied Intelligence has made advancements in integrating with robots, further exploration is needed to enhance the autonomy of robots.

Continual Learning Due to the large training costs associated with their massive scale, MMLLMs are not amenable to frequent re-training. However, updates are necessary to endow MMLLMs with new skills and keep them up-to-date with rapidly evolving human knowledge (Wu et al., 2024). Thus, Continual Learning (CL) is needed to make the model flexible enough to efficiently and continually leverage emerging data while avoiding the substantial cost of retraining MM-LLMs. CL for MM-LLMs can be classified into two stages: continual PT and continual IT. Recently, a continual MM IT benchmark has been proposed to continuously fine-tune MM-LLMs for new MM tasks while maintaining superior performance on tasks learned during the original MM IT stage (He et al., 2023). It introduces two primary challenges: (1) catastrophic forgetting, where models forget previous knowledge when learning new tasks (Robins, 1995; McCloskey and Cohen, 1989; Goodfellow et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2023d,c,b; Zheng et al., 2023a), and (2) negative forward transfer, indicating that the performance of unseen tasks declines when learning new ones (Zheng et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2022, 2024a, 2023b,a).

Mitigating Hallucination Hallucinations entail generating textual descriptions of nonexistent objects without visual cues, which manifest in diverse categories (Liu et al., 2024a) such as misjudgments and inaccuracies in descriptions. The origins of these hallucinations are multifaceted (Liu et al., 2024a), including biases and annotation errors in training data. Additionally, Skip $\backslash n$ (Han et al., 2024) highlights semantic drift biases associated with paragraph separators, which can induce hallucinations when deliberately inserted. Current methods to mitigate these hallucinations involve leveraging self-feedback as visual cues (Lee et al., 2023). However, challenges persist, necessitating nuanced discernment between accurate and hallucinatory outputs, as well as advancements in training methodologies to enhance output reliability.

Biases and Ethical Considerations Despite the strengths of MM-LLMs, ensuring their safe and ef- ficient application remains crucial. Information generated by MM-LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes and cause harm to vulnerable populations. Since MM-LLMs learn from patterns in MM training data, they can reproduce biases present in these data, potentially leading to representational harm. To address this, we can develop new benchmarks specifically designed to evaluate biases in MMLLMs (Luo et al., 2024). Additionally, designing more effective and fine-grained alignment methods is essential. For instance, using RLHF can help calibrate MM-LLMs to produce answers that align with human values and desires (Li et al., 2024c).

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive survey of MM-LLMs with a focus on recent advancements. Initially, we categorize the model architecture into five components, providing a detailed overview of general design formulations and training pipelines. Subsequently, we introduce various SOTA MM-LLMs, each distinguished by its specific formulations. Our survey also sheds light on their capabilities across diverse MM benchmarks and envisions future developments in this rapidly evolving field. We hope this survey can provide insights for researchers, contributing to the ongoing advancements in the MM-LLMs domain.

## Social Impact

MM-LLMs have the potential to impact society. They can enhance accessibility for individuals with disabilities by improved voice recognition and visual aids, fostering equal access to information. In education, MM-LLMs can revolutionize learning with more interactive experiences, catering to diverse learning styles. In media, they can create more engaging content, enriching the consumer experience. However, the widespread adoption of MM-LLMs also poses risks. Privacy concerns arise from the vast training data, raising issues of data security and user privacy. There is also a risk of exacerbating biases in $\mathrm{AI}$ algorithms, as biases in training data can lead to biased outputs. Additionally, the automation of tasks traditionally performed by humans could lead to job displacement, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate potential negative impacts on employment. Overall, while MM-LLMs offer promising opportunities, it is essential to address these challenges to ensure their responsible and equitable deployment.

#### Abstract

Vision-Large-Language-Models (Vision-LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into autonomous driving (AD) systems due to their advanced visual-language reasoning capabilities, targeting the perception, prediction, planning, and control mechanisms. However, Vision-LLMs have demonstrated susceptibilities against various types of adversarial attacks, which would compromise their reliability and safety. To further explore the risk in AD systems and the transferability of practical threats, we propose to leverage typographic attacks against AD systems relying on the decision-making capabilities of Vision-LLMs. Different from the few existing works developing general datasets of typographic attacks, this paper focuses on realistic traffic scenarios where these attacks can be deployed, on their potential effects on the decision-making autonomy, and on the practical ways in which these attacks can be physically presented. To achieve the above goals, we first propose a dataset-agnostic framework for automatically generating false answers that can mislead Vision-LLMs' reasoning. Then, we present a linguistic augmentation scheme that facilitates attacks at image-level and regionlevel reasoning, and we extend it with attack patterns against multiple reasoning tasks simultaneously. Based on these, we conduct a study on how these attacks can be realized in physical traffic scenarios. Through our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness, transferability, and realizability of typographic attacks in traffic scenes. Our findings demonstrate particular harmfulness of the typographic attacks against existing Vision-LLMs (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen-VL, VILA, and Imp), thereby raising community awareness of vulnerabilities when incorporating such models into AD systems. We will release our source code upon acceptance.


## 1 Introduction

Vision-Language Large Models (Vision-LLMs) have seen rapid development over the recent years [1, 2, 3], and their incorporation into autonomous driving (AD) systems have been seriously considered by both industry and academia $[4,5,6,7,8,9]$. The integration of Vision-LLMs into AD systems showcases their ability to convey explicit reasoning steps to road users on the fly and satisfy the need for textual justifications of traffic scenarios regarding perception, prediction, planning, and control, particularly in safety-critical circumstances in the physical world. The core strength of VisionLLMs lies in their auto-regressive capabilities through large-scale pretraining with visual-language alignment [1], making them even able to perform zero-shot optical character recognition, grounded reasoning, visual-question answering, visual-language reasoning, etc. Nevertheless, despite their
impressive capabilities, Vision-LLMs are unfortunately not impervious against adversarial attacks that can misdirect the reasoning processes [10]. Any successful attack strategies have the potential to pose critical problems when deploying Vision-LLMs in AD systems, especially those that may even bypass the models' black-box characteristics. As a step towards their reliable adoption in AD, studying the transferability of adversarial attacks is crucial to raising awareness of practical threats against deployed Vision-LLMs, and to efforts in building appropriate defense strategies for them.

In this work, we revisit the shared auto-regressive characteristic of different Vision-LLMs and intuitively turn that strength into a weakness by leveraging typographic forms of adversarial attacks, also known as typographic attacks. Typographic attacks were first studied in the context of the wellknown Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model [11, 12]. Early works in this area focused on developing a general typographic attack dataset targeting multiple-choice answering (such as object recognition, visual attribute detection, and commonsense answering) and enumeration [13]. Researchers also explored multiple-choice self-generating attacks against zero-shot classification [14], and proposed several defense mechanisms, including keyword-training [15] and prompting the model for detailed reasoning [16]. Despite these initial efforts, the methodologies have neither seen a comprehensive attack framework nor been explicitly designed to investigate the impact of typographic attacks on safety-critical systems, particularly those in $\mathrm{AD}$ scenarios.

Our work aims to fill this research gap by studying typographic attacks from the perspective of $\mathrm{AD}$ systems that incorporate Vision-LLMs. In summary, our scientific contributions are threefold:

- Dataset-Independent Framework: we introduce a dataset-independent framework designed to automatically generate misleading answers that can disrupt the reasoning processes of Vision-Large Language Models (Vision-LLMs).
- Linguistic Augmentation Schemes: we develop a linguistic augmentation scheme aimed at facilitating stronger typographic attacks on Vision-LLMs. This scheme targets reasoning at both the image and region levels and is expandable to multiple reasoning tasks simultaneously.
- Empirical Study in Semi-Realistic Scenarios: we conduct a study to explore the possible implementations of these attacks in real-world traffic scenarios.

Through our empirical study of typographic attacks in traffic scenes, we hope to raise community awareness of critical typographic vulnerabilities when incorporating such models into AD systems.

## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Vision-LLMs

Having demonstrated the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning across various natural language benchmarks, researchers have extended LLMs with visual encoders to support multimodal understanding. This integration has given rise to various forms of Vision-LLMs, capable of reasoning based on the composition of visual and language inputs.

Vision-LLMs Pre-training. The interconnection between LLMs and pre-trained vision models involves the individual pre-training of unimodal encoders on their respective domains, followed by large-scale vision-language joint training $[17,18,19,20,2,1]$. Through an interleaved visual language corpus (e.g., MMC4 [21] and M3W [22]), auto-regressive models learn to process images by converting them into visual tokens, combine these with textual tokens, and input them into LLMs. Visual inputs are treated as a foreign language, enhancing traditional text-only LLMs by enabling visual understanding while retaining their language capabilities. Hence, a straightforward pre-training strategy may not be designed to handle cases where input text is significantly more aligned with visual texts in an image than with the visual context of that image.

Vision-LLMs in AD Systems. Vision-LLMs have proven useful for perception, planning, reasoning, and control in autonomous driving (AD) systems $[6,7,9,5]$. For example, existing works have quantitatively benchmarked the linguistic capabilities of Vision-LLMs in terms of their trustworthiness in explaining the decision-making processes of AD [7]. Others have explored the use of VisionLLMs for vehicular maneuvering $[8,5]$, and [6] even validated an approach in controlled physical environments. Because AD systems involve safety-critical situations, comprehensive analyses of their vulnerabilities are crucial for reliable deployment and inference. However, proposed adoptions
of Vision-LLMs into AD have been straightforward, which means existing issues (e.g., vulnerabilities against typographic attacks) in such models are likely present without proper countermeasures.

### 2.2 Transferable Adversarial Attacks

Adversarial attacks are most harmful when they can be developed in a closed setting with public frameworks yet can still be realized to attack unseen, closed-source models. The literature on these transferable attacks popularly spans across gradient-based strategies. Against Vision-LLMs, our research focuses on exploring the transferability of typographic attacks.

Gradient-based Attacks. Since Szegedy et al. introduced the concept of adversarial examples, gradient-based methods have become the cornerstone of adversarial attacks [23, 24]. Goodfellow et al. proposed the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM [25]) to generate adversarial examples using a single gradient step, perturbing the model's input before backpropagation. Kurakin et al. later improved FGSM with an iterative optimization method, resulting in Iterative-FGSM (I-FGSM) [26]. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD [27]) further enhances I-FGSM by incorporating random noise initialization, leading to better attack performance. Gradient-based transfer attack methods typically use a known surrogate model, leveraging its parameters and gradients to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to attack a black-box model. These methods often rely on multistep iterative optimization techniques like PGD and employ various data augmentation strategies to enhance transferability $[28,29,30,31,32]$. However, gradient-based methods face limitations in adversarial transferability due to the disparity between the surrogate and target models, and the tendency of adversarial examples to overfit the surrogate model $[33,34]$.

Typographic Attacks. The development of large-scale pretrained vision-language with CLIP [11, 12] introduced a form of typographic attacks that can impair its zero-shot performances. A concurrent work [13] has also shown that such typographic attacks can extend to language reasoning tasks of Vision-LLMs like multi-choice question-answering and image-level open-vocabulary recognition. Similarly, another work [14] has developed a benchmark by utilizing a Vision-LLM to recommend an attack against itself given an image, a question, and its answer on classification datasets. Several defense mechanisms $[15,16]$ have been suggested by prompting the Vision-LLM to perform step-bystep reasoning. Our research differs from existing works in studying autonomous typographic attacks across question-answering scenarios of recognition, action reasoning, and scene understanding, particularly against Vision-LLMs in AD systems. Our work also discusses how they can affect reasoning capabilities at the image level, region-level understanding, and even against multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we also discuss how these attacks can be realized in the physical world, particularly against $\mathrm{AD}$ systems.

## 3 Preliminaries

### 3.1 Revisiting Auto-Regressive Vision-LLMs

As a simplified formulation of auto-regressive Vision-LLMs, suppose we have a visual input $\mathbf{v}$, a sequence of tokens generated up to timestep $t-1$, denoted as $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{t-1}$, and $f(\cdot)$ as the Vision-LLM model function, whose goal is to predict the next token $x_{t}$. We can denote its output vector of logits $\mathbf{y}_{t}$ at each timestep $t$ based on the previous tokens and the visual context:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{y}_{t} & =f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, \mathbf{v}\right)  \tag{1}\\
& =f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ denotes $m$ visual tokens encoded by a visual encoder on $\mathbf{v}$. The logits $\mathbf{y}_{t}$ are converted into a probability distribution using the softmax function. Specifically, $y_{t, j} \in \mathbf{y}_{t}$ is the logit for token $j$ in the vocabulary $C$ at timestep $t$, generally as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
P\left(x_{t}=j \mid x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, \mathbf{v}\right)=\frac{\exp \left(y_{t, j}\right)}{\sum_{k \in C} \exp \left(y_{t, k}\right)} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then, the general language modeling loss for training the model can be based on cross-entropy loss. For a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{x}=\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right\}$, the loss is given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{L M}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{t=1}^{n} \log P\left(x_{t} \mid x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n+m} \log P\left(x_{t} \mid z_{1}, \ldots, z_{k-1}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $z_{i}$ denotes either a textual token $x$ or visual token $v$ at position $i$. Vision-LLMs possess conversational capabilities at their core, so interleaving language data $(m=0)$ and vision-language data $(m>0)$ during optimization is crucial for enabling visual understanding while retaining language reasoning [1]. Regardless of $m$, the loss objective of vision-guided language modeling is essentially the same as auto-regressive language modeling [35]. Consequently, as part of the alignment process, these practices imply blurred boundaries between textual and visual feature tokens during training. They may also facilitate text-to-text alignment between raw texts and within-image texts at inference.

### 3.2 Typographic Attacks in Vision-LLMs-based AD Systems

The integration of Vision-LLMs into end-to-end AD systems has brought promising results thus far [9], where Vision-LLMs can enhance user trust through explicit reasoning steps of the scene. On the one hand, language reasoning in $\mathrm{AD}$ systems can elevate their capabilities by utilizing the learned commonsense of LLMs, while being able to proficiently communicate to users. On the other hand, exposing Vision-LLMs to public traffic scenarios not only makes them more vulnerable to typographic attacks that misdirect the reasoning process but can also prove harmful if their results are connected with decision-making, judgment, and control processes.

Unlike the less transferable gradientbased attacks, typographic attacks are more transferable across VisionLLMs by exploiting the inherent textto-text alignment between raw texts and within-image texts to introduce

Table 1: Transferability and stealthiness of attacks.

misleading textual patterns in images, and influence the reasoning of a Vision-LLM, i.e., dominating over visual-text alignment. In digital form, the attack is formulated as a function $\tau(\cdot)$ that applies transformations representing typographic attacks to obtain an adversarial image $\hat{\mathbf{v}}=\tau(\mathbf{v})$. Then, Eq. 1 can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{y}_{t} & =f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, \hat{\mathbf{v}}\right) \\
& =f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}, \hat{v}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{v}_{m}\right) \tag{4}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\hat{v}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{v}_{m}$ denotes $m$ visual tokens under the influenced image $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$, and whose textual content is meant to (1) align with $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}\right\}$, (2) yet guide the reasoning process towards an incorrect answer. By exploiting the fundamental properties of many Vision-LLMs in language modeling to construct adversarial patterns, (3 typographic attacks $\tau(\cdot)$ aim to be transferable across various pre-trained Vision-LLMs by directly influencing the visual information with texts. Our study is geared towards typographic attacks in AD scenarios to thoroughly understand the issues and raise awareness.

## 4 Methodology

Figure 1 shows an overview of our typographic attack pipeline, which goes from prompt engineering to attack annotation, particularly through Attack Auto-Generation, Attack Augmentation, and Attack Realization steps. We describe the details of each step in the following subsections.

### 4.1 Auto-Generation of Typographic Attack

In this subsection, to handle the lack of both autonomy and diversity in typographic attacks, we propose to employ the support of an LLM and prompt engineering, denoted by a model function $l(\cdot)$, to generate adversarial typographic patterns automatically. Let $\mathbf{q}$, a respectively be the question prompt input and its answer on an image $\mathbf{v}$, the adversarial text can be naively generated as $\hat{\mathbf{a}}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\mathbf{a}}=l(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{a}) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

In order to generate useful misdirection, the adversarial patterns must align with an existing question while guiding LLM toward an incorrect answer. We can achieve this through a concept called directive, which refers to configuring the goal for an LLM, e.g., ChatGPT, to impose specific constraints while encouraging diverse behaviors. In our context, we direct the LLM to generate â as an opposite of the given answer $\mathbf{a}$, under the constraint of the given question $\mathbf{q}$. Therefore, we can initialize directives to the LLM using the following prompts in Fig. 2,

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_c6df37718d08a331efc5g-05.jpg?height=463&width=1374&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=365)

Figure 1: Our proposed pipeline is from attack generation via directives to augmentation by commands and conjunctions to positioning the attacks and finally influencing inference.

You are an assistant specialized in generating incorrect answers for questions in the field of autonomous driving. Based on the questions and correct answers provided, you will generate incorrect answers while adhering to the following guidelines:

1. For questions asking for the next action, provide an incorrect action, such as suggesting crossing the street.
2. For questions asking for a quantity, give an incorrect number but keep the noun the same. For example, if the correct answer is "5 people," you can say "7 people."
3. For Yes/No questions, do not just answer Yes/No. Provide a detailed but incorrect explanation.
4. For questions asking for specific locations, objects, or colors, provide incorrect answers.
5. For questions asking for reasons, give incorrect reasons.
6. All incorrect answers must be limited to 10 words.

Figure 2: Context directive for constraints of attack generation.

When generating attacks, we would impose additional constraints depending on the question type. In our context, we focus on tasks of (1) scene reasoning (e.g., counting), (2) scene object reasoning (e.g., recognition), and 3 action reasoning (e.g., action recommendation), as follows in Fig. 3,

Here are some examples:

Input: [Question: What should the autonomous car do? True Answer: Stop and wait until the light turns green.] Output: Drive through the road quickly.

Input: [Question: How many cars in the scene? True Answer: 10 cars.]

Output: 15 cars.

Input: [Question: Is there a traffic light? If yes, what color is displayed? True Answer: Yes, a temporary traffic light. It is showing green.]

Output: Yes, a temporary traffic light. It is showing red.

Input: [Question: How many pedestrians can be seen? True Answer: No pedestrian can be seen.]

Output: There are 10 pedestrians.

Input: [Question: Are there any pedestrian crossing ahead? True Answer: No.]

Output: Yes, there are some pedestrian crossing ahead.

Input:[Question:What is the current action and its justification? Answer in the form 'action, justification'. True Answer:Cautiously proceeding straight with a slight deceleration, there is a jaywalker on the road but he is almost done and we have a priority.]

Output:

Accelerate rapidly, there is no jaywalker on the road.

Figure 3: Template directive for attack generation, and an example.

The directives encourage the LLM to generate attacks that influence a Vision-LLM's reasoning step through text-to-text alignment and automatically produce typographic patterns as benchmark attacks. Clearly, the aforementioned typographic attack only works for single-task scenarios, i.e., a single pair
of question and answer. To investigate multi-task vulnerabilities with respect to multiple pairs, we can also generalize the formulation to $K$ pairs of questions and answers, denoted as $\mathbf{q}_{i}, \mathbf{a}_{i}$, to obtain the adversarial text $\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{i}$ for $i \in[1, K]$.

### 4.2 Augmentations of Typographic Attack

Inspired by the success of instruction-prompting methodologies [37,38], the greedy reasoning in LLMs [39], and to further exploit the ambiguity between textual and visual tokens in Vision-LLMs, we propose to augment the typographic attacks prompts within images by explicitly providing instruction keywords that emphasize text-to-text alignment over that of visual-language tokens. Our approach realizes the concept in the form of instructional directives: (1) command directives for emphasizing a false answer and (2) conjunction directives to additionally include attack clauses. In particular, we have developed,

- Command Directive. By embedding commands with the attacks, we aim to prompt the VisionLLMs into greedily producing erroneous answers. Our work investigates the "ANSWER:" directive as a prefix before the first attack prompt.
- Conjunction Directive. Conjunctions, connectors (or the lack thereof) act to link together separate attack concepts that make the overall text appear more coherent, thereby increasing the likelihood of multi-task success. In our work, we investigate these directives as "AND," "OR," "WITH," or simply empty spaces as prefixes between attack prompts.

While other forms of directives can also be useful for enhancing the attack success rate, we focus on investigating basic directives related to typographic attacks in this work.

### 4.3 Realizations of Typographic Attacks

Digitally, typographic attacks are about embedding texts within images to fool the capabilities of Vision-LLMs, which might involve simply putting texts into the images. Physically, typographic attacks can incorporate real elements (e.g., stickers, paints, and drawings) into environments/entities observable by AI systems, with AD systems being prime examples. This would include the placement of texts with unusual fonts or colors on streets, objects, vehicles, or clothing to mislead AD systems in reasoning, planning, and control. We investigate Vision-LLMs when incorporated into AD systems, as they are likely under the most risk against typographic attacks. We categorize the placement locations as being identified with backgrounds and foregrounds in traffic scenes.

- Backgrounds, which refer to elements in the environment that are static and pervasive in a traffic scene (e.g., streets, buildings, and bus stops). The background components present predefined locations for introducing deceptive typographic elements of various sizes.
- Foregrounds, which refer to dynamic elements and directly interact with the perception of AD systems (e.g., vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians). The foreground components present dynamic and variable locations for typographic attacks of various sizes.

In our work, foreground placements are supported by an open-vocabulary object detector [40] to flexibly extract box locations of specific targets. Let $\mathbf{A}=\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{1}\|\ldots\| \hat{\mathbf{a}}_{K}$ be the typographic concatenation of attacks, and $\mathbf{A}^{\prime}$ be its augmented version, either on background or foreground, the function $\tau(\cdot)$ would perform inpainting $\mathbf{A}$ or $\mathbf{A}^{\prime}$ into image $\mathbf{v}$ 's cropped box coordinates $x_{\min }, y_{\min }, x_{\max }, y_{\max }$.

Depending on the attacked task, we observe that different text placements and observed sizes would render some attacks more effective while some others are negligible. Our research illuminates that background-placement attacks are quite effective against scene reasoning and action reasoning but not as effective against scene object reasoning unless foreground placements are also included.

## 5 Experiments

### 5.1 Experimental Setup

We perform experiments with Vision-LLMs on VQA datasets for AD, such as LingoQA [7] and the dataset of CVPRW'2024 Challenge ${ }^{1}$ by CARLA simulator. We have used LLaVa [2] to output the attack prompts for LingoQA and the CVPRW'2024 dataset, and manually for some cases of the latter. Regarding LingoQA, we tested 1000 QAs in real traffic scenarios in tasks, such as scene reasoning and action reasoning. Regarding the CVPRW'2024 Challenge dataset, we tested more than 300 QAs on 100 images, each with at least three questions related to scene reasoning (e.g., target counting) and scene object reasoning of 5 classes (cars, persons, motorcycles, traffic lights and road signals). Our evaluation metrics are based on exact matches, Lingo-Judge Accuracy [7], and BLEURT [41], BERTScore [42] against non-attacked answers, with SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to quantify the similarity between original and attacked images. In terms of models, we qualitatively and/or quantitatively tested with LLaVa [2], VILA [1], Qwen-VL [17], and Imp [18]. The models were run on an NVIDIA A40 GPU with approximately $45 \mathrm{GiB}$ of memory.

### 5.1.1 Attacks on Scene/Action Reasoning

As shown in Tab. 2, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5, our framework of attack can effectively misdirect various models' reasoning. For example, Tab. 2 showcases an ablation study on the effectiveness of automatic attack strategies across two datasets: LingoQA and CVPRW'24 (focused solely on counting). The former two metrics (i.e. Exact and Lingo-Judge) are used to evaluate semantic correctness better, showing that short answers like the counting task can be easily misled, but longer, more complex[^0]

answers in LingoQA may be more difficult to change. For example, the Qwen-VL attack scores 0.3191 under the Exact metric for LingoQA, indicating relative effectiveness compared to other scores in the same metric in counting. On the other hand, we see that the latter two scores (i.e. BLEURT and BERTScore) are typically high, hinting that our attack can mislead semantic reasoning, but even the wrong answers may still align with humans decently.

In terms of scene reasoning, we show in Tab. 3, Tab. 4, and Fig. 4 the effectiveness of our proposed attack against a number of cases. For example, in Fig. 4, a Vision-LLM can somewhat accurately answer queries about a clean image, but a typographic attacked input can make it fail, such as to accurately count people and vehicles, and we show that an augmented typographic attacked input can even attack stronger models (e.g. GPT4 [43]). In Fig. 5, we also show that scene reasoning can be misdirected where irrelevant details are focused on and hallucinate under typographic attacks. Our work also suggests that scene object reasoning / grounded object reasoning is typically more robust, as both object-level and image-level attacks may be needed to change the models' answers.

In terms of action reasoning, we show in Fig. 5 that Vision-LLMs can recommend terribly bad advice, suggesting unsafe driving practices. Nevertheless, we see a promising point when Qwen-VL recommended fatal advice, but it reconsidered over the reasoning process of acknowledging the potential dangers of the initial bad suggestion. These examples demonstrate the vulnerabilities in automated reasoning processes under deceptive or manipulated conditions, but they also suggest that defensive learning can be applied to enhance model reasoning.

### 5.1.2 Compositions and Augmentations of Attacks

We showed that composing multiple QA tasks for an attack is possible for a particular scenario, thereby sug. gesting that typographic attacks are not single-task attacks, as suggested by previous works. Furthermore, we found that augmentations of attacks are possible, which would imply that typographic attacks that leverage the inherent language modeling process can misdirect the reasoning of Vision-LLMs, as especially shown in the case of the strong GPT-4. However, as shown in Tab. 5, it may be challenging to search for the best augmentation keywords.

### 5.1.3 Towards Physical Typographic Attacks

In our toy experiments with semi-realistic attacks in Fig.5, we show that attacks involve manipulating text within real-world settings are potentially dangerous due to their ease of implementation, such as on signs, behind vehicles, on buildings, billboards, or any everyday object that an AD system might perceive and interpret to make decisions. For instance, modifying the text on a road sign from "stop" to "go faster" can pose potentially dangerous consequences on AD systems that utilize Vision-LLMs.

## 6 Conclusion

Our research has developed a comprehensive typographic attack framework designed for benchmarking Vision-LLMs under AD systems, exploring their adoption, the potential impacts on decisionmaking autonomy, and the methods by which these attacks can be physically implemented. Firstly, our dataset-agnostic framework is capable of automatically generating misleading responses that misdirect the reasoning of Vision-LLMs. Secondly, our linguistic formatting scheme is shown to augment attacks at a higher degree and can extend to simultaneously targeting multiple reasoning tasks. Thirdly, our study on the practical implementation of these attacks in physical traffic scenarios is critical for highlighting the need for defense models. Our empirical findings on the effectiveness, transferability, and realizability of typographic attacks in traffic environments highlight their effects on existing Vision-LLMs (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen-VL, VILA). This research underscores the urgent need for increased awareness within the community regarding vulnerabilities associated with integrating Vision-LLMs into AD systems.

Limitations. One of the primary limitations of our typographic attack framework lies in its dependency on environmental control and predictability. Our framework can demonstrate the vulnerability of Vision-LLMs to typographic manipulations in controlled settings, so the variability and unpredictability of real-world traffic scenarios can significantly diminish the consistency and reproducibility of the attacks. Additionally, our attacks assume that AD systems do not evolve to recognize and mitigate such manipulations, which may not hold true as defensive technologies advance. Another limitation is the ethical concern of testing and deploying such attacks, which could potentially endanger public safety if not managed correctly. This necessitates a careful approach to research and disclosure to ensure that knowledge of vulnerabilities does not lead to malicious exploitation.

Safeguards. To safeguard against the vulnerabilities exposed by typographic attacks, it is essential to develop robust defensive mechanisms within AD systems. While the current literature on defensive techniques is still understudied, there are ways forward to mitigate potential issues. A concurrent work is investigating how better prompting can support better reasoning to defend against the attacks [16], or how incorporating keyword training of Vision-LLMs can make these systems more resilient to such attacks by conditioning their answers on specific prefixes [15]. Another basic approach is to detect and remove all non-essential texts in the visual information. Overall, it is necessary to foster a community-wide effort toward establishing standards and best practices for the secure deployment of Vision-LLMs into AD.

Broader Impacts. The implications of our research into typographic attacks extend beyond the technical vulnerabilities of AD systems, touching on broader societal, ethical, and regulatory concerns. As Vision-LLMs and AD technologies proliferate, the potential for such attacks underscores the need for comprehensive safety and security frameworks that anticipate and mitigate unconventional threats. This research highlights the interplay between technology and human factors, illustrating how seemingly minor alterations in a traffic environment can lead to significant misjudgments by $\mathrm{AD}$ systems, potentially endangering public safety.

## 1 Introduction

Introduction In the vibrant and ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)[36,33] have emerged as a transformative force, bridging the gap between diverse data representations and their comprehension. These models, adept at integrating information from multiple modalities such as text and images, have significantly expanded the scope of research and practical applications. A critical area of focus within this domain is the automation of tasks involving Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)[13]. The

And so on..

Fig. 1: A Sample Case of GUI Automation Difficulty. In order to build intelligent systems capable of interacting seamlessly with various applications, identifying relevant UI components is crucial. As shown in this Gmail example, specifying tasks and their logical continuations requires a precise understanding of underlying GUI structures, predicting the next action, and precisely performing the grounding task. Our approach addresses these challenges effectively.

automation of these tasks holds immense potential for enhancing efficiency and productivity across a wide range of applications.

However, a significant portion of existing models and benchmarks in this field have been primarily centred on text-based tasks. This approach overlooks the vast potential of multimodal agents that can effectively process and integrate visual information for problem resolution. The main thrust of our research is the application of these models, with a particular emphasis on the concept of grounding, especially in the context of GUI images. Grounding, in the realm of MLLMs, refers to the process of associating words or phrases in a language with corresponding entities in other modalities. For instance, in a text-image pair, the term "apple" would be grounded in the image of an apple. This capability of MLLMs to efficiently and precisely perform grounding is particularly crucial for automating GUI tasks $[14,12]$.

However, grounding in MLLMs presents a unique set of challenges. A primary concern is the alignment of modalities, i.e., ensuring the model accurately correlates entities across different modalities. Several multimodal LLMs have recently

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_506ce845a1e4f23aca25g-03.jpg?height=339&width=1206&top_left_y=405&top_left_x=470)

addressed this issue by employing projection layers to convert one embedding to another. Despite these advancements, the coordinates of the bounding boxes provided by these models in the form of LLM text responses often lack precision. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with GUIs, where the accuracy of object detection and localization is critical. Existing LLMs rely on textual descriptions of visual content or the HTML context of web pages, but essential details like icons, images, diagrams, and spatial relationships may be overlooked or misrepresented during conversion to text embeddings [9,19]. Many GUIs do not offer direct textual interfaces for automation, highlighting the need for a multimodal LLM that can directly process visual GUI signals. The precision in detecting and interacting with GUI elements is of paramount importance in this context. The ability to accurately identify and interact with GUI elements not only enhances the functionality of these agents but also significantly augments their utility in real-world applications. The primary objective of this research is to push the boundaries of multimodal agent-based GUI task automation by developing a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can effectively navigate, understand, and interact with GUI elements with high precision.

Our proposed model, V-Zen, is specifically designed to address these challenges. V-Zen is not just another MLLM but a sophisticated GUI Agent that can accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, precisely identify GUI elements, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. V-Zen integrates a visual grounding module that harnesses the capabilities of the DINO detector, equipping it to effectively handle multimodal grounding tasks. In addition to the text response by LLM, the coordinates of grounding are provided separately by the grounding module, replacing a typical object detection module, thereby ensuring precise coordinates. The model's performance is further augmented by a High Cross-Resolution Module (HRCM), which enables the model to process high-resolution features and comprehend text within images. In conjunction with the development of the novel model, we have also created a dataset for this task named GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Data for Execution) [5], a cutting-edge benchmark dataset that includes bounding box annotations and textual descriptions with chain of thought
collected across various GUI platforms. GUIDE aids in advancing agentive research, ultimately leading to the development of more agile, responsive, and human-like agents across a multitude of fields.

Our key contributions in this paper are:

1. We propose V-Zen, a novel GUI Agent that leverages the power of MLLMs for efficient GUI understanding and task prediction, forming a self-operating system for various GUI tasks.
2. We introduce a visual grounding module that leverages the DINO detector's capabilities, enabling it to handle multimodal grounding tasks effectively.
3. We design a unique architecture that processes an input image in parallel at two different resolutions, allowing for efficient GUI understanding and task prediction.
4. We curate and publicly release GUIDE, a state-of-the-art benchmark dataset for executing tasks on diverse GUI platforms.

In addition to our key contributions outlined above, we conduct a thorough comparative analysis of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Grounding MLLM models under similar experimental setups. We also examine the contributions of individual modules in our model towards accuracy as an ablation study (Table 3). Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations and potential avenues for future research in the field. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 offers a comprehensive review of related work in the field of MLLMs and grounding. Section 3 delineates the architecture of our proposed model, V-Zen. Section 4 introduces the GUIDE dataset and its construction. Section 5 discusses the experiments conducted and the results obtained. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work. This research aims to contribute significantly to the field of AI, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in GUI automation.

## 2 Related Work

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a significant transformation with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs[21,20]). GPT3 [2], one of the pioneering LLMs, marked a milestone by significantly scaling up the model size and training data size, showcasing exceptional performance in numerous NLP tasks and setting a trend for subsequent advancements in the field. Several models such as GPTs [18], PaLM [8], BLOOM [32], and LLaMA [29], have since emerged, each pushing the boundaries of LLMs. These models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in learning from in-context examples, reasoning, following instructions, and operating over long-context sequences. Recent endeavours in the field have concentrated on refining LLMs to better align with human instructions and feedback, with models like InstructGPT [23], ChatGPT [2], and GPT4 [22] standing out as exemplars in this regard.

In the context of building web agents, these LLMs have been leveraged extensively. However, they are primarily text-based and lack the capability to handle
images or other modalities. This limitation has led to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs extend the capabilities of LLMs to understand and integrate information from multiple modalities, such as vision and audio [36]. In the context of GUI automation, our primary focus is on MLLMs, where the input modalities include text and image, and the output is a corresponding text response. The architecture and functioning of MLLMs can vary, but they generally follow a similar pattern: An encoder for each data modality generates the embeddings for data of that modality, an embedding layer aligns embeddings of different modalities into the same multimodal embedding space, and then a LLM generates text responses. Models like Flamingo [1], Kosmos-1 [11], BLIP-2 [15], and PaLM-E [8] exemplify this approach. Over time, the inherent reasoning and decision-making capabilities of MLLMs have improved, enabling them for more intricate tasks like image retrieval, image generation, and visual question answering.

The application of MLLMs in grounding tasks has been a significant area of research. Works such as Kosmos-2 [24] and Shikra [7] have enabled MLLMs to perform fine-grained image comprehension and open-world grounding. Additional works in this direction include GPT4ROI [37], PVIT [6], BuboGPT [38], VisionLLM [31], Ferret [34], Veagle [4] and CogVLM [30]. While these works improve the grounding capabilities of the model through architectural improvements or training strategy improvements, they all have a few limitations, which our work aims to address. Firstly, they produce bounding boxes in the form of pure text output, which, even if it points to the correct object, is not highly accurate. This is particularly relevant for GUI automation tasks, where there are several small elements in GUIs that need to be accurately grounded for some tasks. Secondly, most of them commonly use a $224 \times 224$ resolution image input, which makes the tiny icons and texts in GUI screenshots difficult to recognize.

Our proposed model, V-Zen, addresses these challenges by introducing a novel architecture for efficient GUI understanding and precise grounding. For accurate grounding of GUI elements, we introduce a separate grounding module on top of the LLM in the style of an open-set object detection model, and we also enable a high-resolution $1120 \times 1120$ image input through a cross-attention branch inspired by CogVLM. Additionally, we meticulously curate an extensive instruction-tuning dataset for executing tasks on diverse GUI platforms and finetune our model on it. As a result, V-Zen exhibits superior performance compared to previous works when it comes to executing tasks on diverse GUI platforms.

## 3 Proposed Architecture

The architecture of V-Zen, our proposed multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), is a sophisticated ensemble of interconnected components meticulously designed for efficient GUI understanding and precise grounding. The architecture is composed of five major modules: Low-Resolution Visual Feature Extractor (LRVFE), Multimodal Projection Adapter (MPA), Pretrained Language

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_506ce845a1e4f23aca25g-06.jpg?height=640&width=1198&top_left_y=409&top_left_x=472)

Fig. 3: Proposed Architecture Of V-Zen.

Note: This is just a representational architecture. The final architecture diagram is yet to be drawn - It should contain the module's names as per the equations in the paper

Model with Visual Expert (PLMVE), High-Resolution Cross Visual Module (HRCVM), and High-Precision Grounding Module (HPGM).

### 3.1 Low-Resolution Visual Feature Extractor

The journey of input through the architecture commences with the LRVFE, a low-resolution encoder (EVA-2-CLIP [26,25]) that processes the input image at a resolution of $224 \times 224$. This module is responsible for extracting meaningful features from the image, which are then used for further processing. Given an input image $I_{i n}$ and text prompt $T_{i n}$, the LRVFE generates low-resolution image features as:

$$
F_{L R}=L R V F E\left(I_{i n}\right)
$$

### 3.2 Multimodal Projection Adapter

The features extracted by the LRVFE are transformed by the MPA into a format that is suitable for processing by the LLM backbone of our architecture [16]. The MPA plays a pivotal role in aligning the modalities, ensuring that the image features match the input format of the LLM. The transformation can be represented as:

$$
F_{T}=M P A\left(F_{L R}\right)
$$

, where $F_{T}$ are the transformed features.

### 3.3 Pretrained Language Model with Visual Expert

The PLMVE, which adopts Vicuna-7B [27] as the base language model, is tasked with generating text outputs based on the processed image features and any textual input provided. Given an input $X_{i n}^{(i)}$ to the $i$ th attention layer of the PLMVE, it's split into $X_{i m g}^{(i)}$ and $X_{t x t}^{(i)}$. Then, $Q_{i m g}^{(i)}$ is obtained as:

$$
Q_{i m g}^{(i)}=V E L\left(X_{i m g}^{(i)}\right)
$$

, and $Q_{t x t}^{(i)}$ is obtained as:

$$
Q_{t x t}^{(i)}=O L L\left(X_{t x t}^{(i)}\right)
$$

The overall output can be represented as:

This can be overall represented as:

, where VEL represents the Visual Expert Layers, OLL represents the original LLM Layers, and MHSVE represents the process of multi-head self-attention with the visual expert.

### 3.4 High-Resolution Cross Visual Module

The HRCVM, inspired by CogAgent [10], is designed for higher-resolution input, accepting images of size $1120 \times 1120$ pixels. It employs a smaller EVA2-CLIP vision encoder and cross-attention of a small hidden size to fuse high-resolution image features with every layer of the PLMVE. This can be represented as

$$
X_{h i}=H R C V M\left(I_{H R}\right)
$$

, where $I_{H R}$ is the high-resolution input image, and $X_{h i}$ is the high-resolution output of the HRCVM. Each layer's attention procedure with the residual connection can be formulated as

$$
X_{o u t}^{(i)}=M H S V E\left(X_{i n}^{(i)}\right)+X_{i n}^{(i)}
$$

And then final output features with residual connection can be formulated as:

$$
Y_{\text {out }}^{(i)}=M H C A\left(X_{\text {out }}^{(i)}, X_{h i}\right)+X_{\text {out }}^{(i)}
$$

, where MHCA represents multi-head cross-attention.

### 3.5 High-Precision Grounding Module

The HPGM takes the hidden states extracted from the PLMVE and uses them to perform precise grounding tasks [28,35]. Unlike typical MLLM modules that provide grounding bounding boxes as part of the LLM's text output, our HPGM outputs bounding box coordinates separately, ensuring precision. The module follows an enhanced DETR [3] object detector named DINO [17]. PLMVE's last hidden state is used as the query of visual grounding to query the multi-scale feature set for visual grounding, denoted as $q_{l l m \_g n d}$. The multi-scale feature set, denoted as fms_img, is obtained using a Swin Transformer-based backbone. It takes $q_{l l m \_g n d}$ and $f m s \_i m g$ and produces the bounding boxes for precise grounding. This way, the HPGM module can precisely ground the GUI elements based on the processed image and text features.

In conclusion, the architecture of V-Zen, our proposed multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), represents a sophisticated orchestration of several interconnected components. Each module within this architecture is meticulously designed and plays a pivotal role in achieving the overarching goal of efficient GUI understanding and precise grounding. The design of these modules and their intricate interconnections is a testament to the detailed planning and innovative thinking that has gone into the development of V-Zen. This complex yet efficient assembly of components not only enhances the functionality of the system but also significantly augments its utility in real-world applications. The architecture, therefore, stands as a robust framework that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in GUI automation, ultimately contributing significantly to the field of artificial intelligence.

## 4 Experiments and Results: To Be Re-Written Later

### 4.1 Training Procedure

Following the CogAgent [10] pre-training strategy, the model undergoes a twostage training procedure consisting of pre-training and specialised fine-tuning (SFT). During pre-training, the focus lies on enhancing the model's ability to grasp high-resolution images and adapt them for GUI applications by emphasising text recognition, visual grounding, and understanding GUI imagery. Various public datasets serve as pre-training resources, covering synthetic renderings, academic documents, and optical character recognition (OCR) images. After completing the pre-training stage, SFT uses the GUIDE dataset, a specially curated collection of real-world GUI elements and task-based sequences. Through fine-tuning, V-Zen learns from complex workflows, action histories, and negative samples, gaining proficiency in making accurate inferences and performing pertinent actions on previously unencountered GUIs. Training benefits from NVIDIA's $8 *$ A100 platform and utilises the DeepSpeed library for optimal speed while applying the Adam optimiser, a learning rate of 0.00001 , a batch size of 8 , and a gradient accumulation step of 1 to maintain steady learning progression.

### 4.2 GUIDE Dataset

The GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Data for Execution) [5] dataset is a largescale, meticulously curated dataset developed specifically to enhance the applications of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with a particular focus on Robotic Process Automation (RPA) use cases. The dataset, which comprises 124,000 data points, authentically represents user interactions within various GUI environments and covers a diverse array of fields, online platforms, and activities. It includes data from popular GUI platforms such as Apollo.io, Contlo, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Canva. Each data entry in GUIDE consists of an image, a task description, the last action taken, and the next action to be performed, along with grounding information indicating where the action needs to be executed. Furthermore, the dataset incorporates a Chain of Thought (CoT),

GUIDE supports investigations into cross-interface automated tasks and encourages the development of multiplatform LLMs for practical applications in automation and natural language understanding. In essence, GUIDE is about predicting the next task on a given GUI image and performing the corresponding grounding task for correctly interacting with GUI elements like boxes, buttons, icons, etc., across a diverse range of platforms.

### 4.3 Results And Discussion

In this section, we delve into the empirical evaluation of our proposed model, VZen, and its performance on the GUIDE dataset. The evaluation focuses on two pivotal tasks: Next Task Prediction and Grounding. For the Next Task Prediction, we assess the model's ability to predict the next action accurately. Specifically, we compare the predicted action with the ground-truth action in terms of semantic meaning. To measure accuracy, we consider an action prediction correct if it aligns with the intended task progression. For grounding, we focus on bounding box localization accuracy. The F1 score, commonly used in object detection tasks, serves as our primary evaluation metric for grounding accuracy. We juxtapose the performance of V-Zen with other state-of-the-art models, namely

CogAgent, GPT-4V, Chatterbox, and Gemini-Pro, under similar experimental conditions to ensure a fair comparison. As delineated in Table 1, V-Zen exhibits superior performance in the Next Task Prediction task, achieving an accuracy of $93.2 \%$. This metric is indicative of V-Zen's proficiency in accurately predicting the subsequent task in a GUI environment, thereby demonstrating its potential in real-world applications. In the context of the Grounding task, V-Zen continues to outperform the other models, as evidenced in Table 3. With a next-task prediction accuracy of $93.2 \%$ and grounding accuracy of $89.7 \%$, V-Zen demonstrates its capability to precisely ground GUI elements, a critical aspect in GUI automation tasks.

These empirical results underscore the efficacy of V-Zen in both tasks, thereby attesting to its robustness and versatility. The success of V-Zen can be attributed to its innovative architecture, which seamlessly integrates low-resolution and high-resolution visual modules, a multimodal projection adapter, and a highprecision grounding module. This intricate design enables V-Zen to effectively process and integrate visual and textual information, thereby enhancing its GUI understanding and grounding capabilities. Furthermore, the use of the GUIDE dataset for specialised fine-tuning has significantly bolstered V-Zen's proficiency in handling real-world GUI elements and task-based sequences. The GUIDE dataset, with its diverse array of GUI environments and task-based sequences, provides a rich resource for training, thereby enabling V-Zen to learn from complex workflows, action histories, and negative samples. In conclusion, the experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of V-Zen in automating GUI tasks, thereby setting a new benchmark in the realm of multimodal large language models for GUI automation. The results presented herein provide a promising direction for future research in this domain. Future work will focus on further enhancing the performance of V-Zen and expanding its applicability to a wider range of GUI platforms.

#### Abstract

In this paper, we propose a pre-trained foundation model FMint (Foundation Model based on Initialization), designed to speed up large-scale simulations of various differential equations with high accuracy via error correction. Humandesigned simulation algorithms excel at capturing the fundamental physics of engineering problems, but often need to balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While deep learning methods offer innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. FMint bridges these gaps through conditioning on the initial coarse solutions obtained from conventional human-designed algorithms, and trained to obtain refined solutions for various differential equations. Based on the backbone of large language models, we adapt the in-context learning scheme to learn a universal error correction method for dynamical systems from given prompted sequences of coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of $600 \mathrm{~K}$ ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and we conduct extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. FMint outperforms various baselines on large-scale simulation, and demonstrates its capability in generalization to unseen ODEs. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a $5 \mathrm{X}$ speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.


## 1 Introduction

Dynamical systems characterize the evolution of physical states over time. They are fundamental in describing the change of physical states across a wide range of disciplines, including physics [1, 2, 3], chemistry [4, 5], engineering [6, 7, 8], and finance [9, 10]. Typically, these systems are formulated as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d \mathbf{u}(t)}{d t}=\mathbf{f}[\mathbf{u}(t)], \quad \mathbf{u}(0)=\mathbf{c}_{0} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ denotes the initial condition of the system. To solve these systems numerically, one usually employs a human-designed numerical integration algorithm such as Euler method or Runge-Kutta methods. These methods can be adapted easily to solve different types of ODEs that share the same format with guaranteed accuracy. The implementation is given as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{u}_{n+1}=\mathbf{u}_{n}+S\left(\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{u}_{n}, \Delta t_{n}\right), \quad \mathbf{u}_{\mathbf{0}}=c_{0}, \quad n=0,1, \cdots \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$[^0]where $S$ represents the numerical integration scheme, $\Delta t_{n}$ is the step size at $n$-th time step, and $\mathbf{u}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the approximated solution at cumulative time $\sum_{i=0}^{n} \Delta t_{i}$.

One obstacle of these human-designed algorithm is the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. This makes the large-scale simulation using these numerical schemes impossible. Large-scale simulation often entails the simulation of numerous trajectories, each characterized by distinct initial conditions. In fact, in many real-world scenarios, high-volume simulation that produces forecasts on a set of initial conditions simultaneously plays a significant role in various applications. For example, simulations of virus propagation during an epidemic given different circumstances are necessary for formulating health regulations; weather forecasting uses ensemble forecasting to avoid misleading single forecast [11]. In these scenarios, it is practical to standardize the time step $\Delta t:=\Delta t_{1}=\Delta t_{2}=\cdots$ across simulations, facilitating batch processing. Yet, this standardization introduces a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency: a larger time step speeds up the simulation at the cost of increased simulation error, while a smaller time step reduces the error but slows down the simulation. Therefore, the long runtime makes these traditional algorithms unsuitable for wide range simulations in many practical situations.

Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable success across various scientific domains, including solving partial differential equations (PDEs) [12], learning operators [13], and addressing inverse problems [14, 15, 16]. Data-driven algorithms utilize large data sets and are able to compute the desired quantities efficiently with high precision. However, they typically underperform in data-scarce environments and may lack essential domain knowledge. In an effort to facilitate fast simulations using neural network, Huang et al.[11] introduced NeurVec, which is designed to compensate for integration errors that enables large time step simulation with high accuracy. Nevertheless, it faces the same obstacle as many machine learning-based solvers that for each ODE system, a separate model must be trained from scratch. It therefore demands high data and computational complexity, and cannot accommodate out-of-distribution systems, restricting its applicability in real-world simulations.

With the success of large language models such as GPT-4 [17] on numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the scientific computing community has increasingly focused on developing a unified model that can be applied across various systems, especially in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and learning neural operators [18, 13, 19, 20, 21]. For more details, please see Section 2. One particular area of focus for the community is the utilization of in-context learning. Yang et al. [22, 23, 24] introduced the framework of in-context operator learning, which trains the model to learn operators and solve PDEs using prompted data. It demonstrated great generalizability to new PDE examples without any weight updates.

Inspired by the achievement of foundation models in scientific machine learning community, and to address the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency of conventional numerical scheme, we introduce FMint for Foundation Model based on Initialization, a pre-trained foundation model designed to speed up large-scale simulations of dynamical systems with high accuracy via error correction. Moreover, we integrate human expertise i.e., traditional ODE solvers into modern data-driven methods. Using a decoder-only transformer architecture [25], we adapt the idea of in-context learning to obtain refined solutions based on the initialization of coarse solutions that are computed using human-designed integration method for various differential equations.

Concretely, a demo consists of the coarse solution simulated with large time step and the corresponding error to the fine-grained solution using much smaller time step. FMint is then trained on demos that are generated using the ODE equation but different initial conditions. With the errors for the query sequences masked, the model learns a universal error correction method for prompted coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on 600,000 dynamical systems from six main ODE families. Our experiments showcase that our model outperforms baselines in delivering rapid, high-accuracy ODE solutions with $5 \mathrm{X}$ speedup in comparison to numerical integration schemes. We further demonstrate the exceptional generalization capability and data-efficiency through a series of out-of-distribution tasks.

## 2 Related Work

Neural network for dynamical systems. In recent years, neural network based solvers have been increasingly applied to tackle scientific problems, such as solving ordinary or partial differential equations (PDEs), operator learning, and inverse problems. One commonly employed framework parameterizes the PDE solutions with a feed-forward neural network [26, 27, 12, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. The results are enforced to obey the physical laws through either hard or soft constraints incorporated into the network's loss function. While enforcing physical laws through hard constraints guarantees the compliance to the restriction, architecture design requires extensive domain knowledge. Soft constraints implementation enables more flexibility but still imposes physical knowledge in mathematical form. Another framework, the Finite Expression Method (FEX), considers expressing PDE solutions in computer algebra [34, 35, 36], capturing the solution's structure and thus offering high accuracy and interpretable results. Neural operator learning involves a mapping from varying parameters or initial conditions to solutions using neural networks. This method achieves discretization invariance by learning a family of parametric maps, allowing it to generalize across different parameters and conditions of PDEs [13, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Both FEX and neural operator learning demand large amounts of high-quality training data and lack the generalization ability to unseen distribution.

Recently, another line of research has focused on integrating traditional numerical algorithms with deep learning-based methods to enhance the accuracy of dynamical system simulations [42, 11]. For example, NeurVec [11] employs this strategy to enable rapid simulation of ODEs with large time steps. This approach achieved decent accuracy with relatively coarse integration steps on several classic dynamical systems. However, its lack of generalization capability to out-of-distribution (OOD) systems significantly restricts its practicality for large-scale real-world simulations.

## Foundation model in scientific machine learning.

Recently, large language models such as GPT-4 [17], DALL-E [43], and Llama [44] have demonstrated significant achievements in various domains [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], including text-to-visual generation [53, 54], information retrieval [55], and text generation [56, 57]. These models are characterized by their extensive pre-training on large datasets, then are adapted to downstream tasks through zero-shot or few-shot learning approaches, or can be fine-tuned [58, 59] to tackle specific problems, showing impressive generalization and transfer learning capabilities.

Inspired by the breakthroughs, the scientific machine learning community has experienced a marked increase in the adoption of foundation models over the past year. For instance, Subramanian et al. [18] explored the transfer learning capabilities of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) [13]. It is used to solve three classical PDEs and showed its applicability across various physics, scales, and data availability in downstream tasks. The Unified PDE Solver (UPS) [19] extends this approach by covering a broader range of 1D and 2D PDEs, employing a pre-trained large language model for operator learning. In addition, McCabe et al. [20] introduced a method to embed PDEs with varying physical properties into a shared embedding space, facilitating the simultaneous addressing of multiple heterogeneous PDEs. Rahman et al. [21] on the other hand, proposed an attention mechanism tailored to the codomain of PDEs, enhancing the model's ability to handle PDEs with varying dimensions.

Another burgeoning area within scientific machine learning focuses on leveraging in-context learning [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. In this approach, models are prompted with multiple example pairs and are trained to make predictions on a new query data based on patterns recognized from the training demonstrations. A notable implementation of this is the In-context Operator Network (ICON), which Yang et al. have explored in several studies [22, 23, 24]. ICON demonstrates operator learning by using example pairs that vary in parameters of the PDE and their corresponding solutions, thus enabling the network to predict solutions for new query data points. In this paper, we employ the methodology of in-context learning and build a foundation model in enhancing simulation of ODE systems via a error correction scheme.

## 3 Methodology

In solving Equation (1) for large-scale simulations, we consider selecting a numerical integration scheme that utilizes a large time step size. This can be written in stride $k \in\{1,2, \ldots\}$ and step size $\Delta t$ that results in desired accuracy, denoted as $k \Delta t$. For illustrative purposes, we consider the Euler method, which yields the following numerical simulation scheme:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\mathbf{u}}(t+k \Delta t)=\hat{\mathbf{u}}(t)+\mathbf{f}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}(t)] \cdot k \Delta t \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

However, solving the dynamical system (1) with numerical scheme (3) and large step size $k \Delta t$ unavoidably causes large simulation errors. From the Taylor expansion

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{u}(t+k \Delta t)=\underbrace{\mathbf{u}(t)+\mathbf{f}[\mathbf{u}(t)] \cdot k \Delta t}_{\text {For Euler method }}+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \underbrace{\frac{1}{n!} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{n}}{\mathrm{~d} t^{n}} \mathbf{u}(t) \cdot[k \Delta t]^{n}}_{\operatorname{err}_{n}(k, \Delta t, \mathbf{u}(t))} \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

we see that the error term $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \operatorname{err}_{n}(k, \Delta t, \mathbf{u}(t))$ is non-negligible and this limits the fast simulation of real-world dynamical systems. We therefore consider building a corrector foundation model that approximates $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \operatorname{err}_{n}$ for various dynamical systems. We call solutions obtained by vanilla numerical integration schemes (3) with time step $k \Delta t$ as "coarse solutions". With coarse solutions as an initialization, our goal is to produce highly accurate solution with fast inference time on a diverse set of dynamical systems, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k(n+1)}=\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k n}+S\left(\mathbf{f}, \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k n}, k \Delta t\right)+\operatorname{FMint}\left(\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k n} ; \Theta\right), \quad \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{0}=\mathbf{c}_{0}, \quad n=0,1, \cdots \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Theta$ represents all the model parameters.

Inspired by the success of large language models in various domains and the employment of in-context learning with transformer in scientific computing [22], we designed our model using a decoder-only transformer backbone [25]. The model is trained to perform in-context learning such that it predicts the error correction term in examples based on previous demonstrations. The training is done in a similar manner to the next-token-prediction scheme.

Input tokens. We construct FMint to learn the corrector from multiple demos from the same ODE system, each consists of coarse solutions and their corresponding correction term. In details, for $i$-th ODE equation, we first simulate using fine step size $\Delta t$ and obtain ODE $\left\{\mathbf{u}_{j}^{i}\right\}_{j=1}^{k n}$ where $\mathbf{u}_{j}^{i}$ represents the fine-grained solution for $i$-th ODE system at time step $j \Delta t$. Then using coarse step size $k \Delta t$, we generate ODE results $\left\{\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}^{i}\right\}_{j=1}^{n}$ where we denote $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}^{i}$ the coarse solution for $i$-th ODE equation at time step $k j \Delta t$ with predefined stride $k$. The corresponding error correction term for each coarse solutions are computed from the difference

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{err}_{\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}}=\mathbf{u}_{k(j+1)}-\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}-S\left(\mathbf{f}, \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}, k \Delta t\right) \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

One pair of coarse solutions $\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{i}=\left\{\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}^{i}\right\}_{j=1}^{n}$ and error term $\operatorname{err}^{i}=\left\{\operatorname{err}_{\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{k j}^{i}}\right\}$ composes one demo. The model takes a collection of demos of size $d$, a query data sequence $\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{t}$ and outputs an error correction term err ${ }^{t}$ for the query data

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{\left\{\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{1}, \operatorname{err}^{1}\right\},\left\{\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{2}, \operatorname{err}^{2}\right\}, \ldots,\left\{\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{d}, \operatorname{err}^{d}\right\}, \hat{\mathbf{u}}^{t}\right\} \rightarrow \operatorname{err}^{t} \tag{7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Table 1 shows an example of demo's input tokens for a two-dimensional ODE system. Similarly to [22], the first row key contains the time steps, i.e. $t_{1}=k \Delta t, t_{2}=2 k \Delta t, \ldots, t_{n}=n k \Delta t$, which is the same for both coarse solutions and error terms. The second and third rows consist of the coarse solutions for both dimensions and their corresponding correction terms. For one-dimensional ODE systems, the last rows are populated with zeros. Each column in the table represents one token.

Model architecture. During training, each token undergoes transformation through a shared embedding layer to obtain a representative embedding vector. This vector is then concatenated with a learnable positional embedding to maintain temporal context. To preserve order invariance among key-value pairs e.g., see Table 1, all tokens of the same type within an example share the same positional encoding. The concatenated vectors are fed into the transformer model, and the transformer's output is subsequently directed to a prediction head for error prediction of the query coarse solution. The model is then updated through the mean squared error of the prediction. The architecture of FMint is shown in Figure 1 .

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_d0ac8d01bd923307fd55g-05.jpg?height=629&width=1284&top_left_y=301&top_left_x=407)

Figure 1: FMint first prepares data through simulations of coarse and fine solutions. The input tokens are generated from coarse solutions and corrections (6). Model takes input tokens of demos and the query ODE and output the predicted error terms for the query ODE.

A major challenge in training decoder-only transformer models is the implementation of masking. Specifically, when predicting the error term for the query ODE, the model must consider the coarse solutions and correction values from preceding examples, and coarse solutions from the query ODE but not the ground truth error term. This requirement stems from the fact that all demonstration examples pertain to the identical ODE, differing only in their initial conditions. Moreover, predictions of QoI are independent and remain unaffected by the order of the tokens. To effectively manage these constraints, we employ a specialized transformer masking technique employed by Yang et al. [24]. The mask satisfies all the constraints mentioned and has shown great efficiency in computational science.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FMint through a variety of in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. We first compare FMint with various baselines on large-scale simulation of ODE systems. Then we investigate the generalization ability for three circumstances under zeroto few-shot or fine-tuning: (1) unseen ODE families, (2) unseen coefficients range, and (3) unseen strides. Lastly, we perform ablation studies examining the effects of various design decisions in FMint.

### 4.1 Basic set-up

Data preparation. The training data consists of $600 \mathrm{~K}$ ODEs that are commonly observed in important applications in engineering and science. To pre-train our foundation model, we initially generate time series data from key dynamical systems that are prevalent across various applications. For each specified ODE, we create 1,000 variations with different parameters, and for each variation, we produce 100 trajectories with unique initial conditions. Consequently, our dataset comprises trajectories of 100,000 ODEs for each dynamical system, differentiated by varying coefficients and initial conditions. Our model is trained on data from six dynamical systems: Newton's Law of

To test our model's performance and data-efficiency on unseen ODEs via zero-shot learning and fine-tuning, we use data prepared from the two dynamical systems: exponential decay equation (1D) and driven damped pendulum (2D).

For all ODE systems, the time step size $\Delta t$, the value of strides $k$, the range of initial conditions (IC), and the numerical integration scheme used for simulations are summarized in Table 2 For more details on the physical representations of parameters in each ODE system, see Appendix A. 1

Implementation details. As a decoder-only transformer model, FMint is configured with approximately 15.8 million parameters. The model features six heads for multi-head attention, with an input/output dimension of 256 for each layer. Demo number for training used is five. The dimension for the query, key, and value of each token is set to 256 , and the hidden dimension of the feed-forward networks is 1024. All experiments are conducted on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with $80 \mathrm{~GB}$ of memory and the pre-training takes approximately 24 hours. We use AdamW optimizer with a warmup-cosinedecay schedule, with peak learning rate 1e-4 and 60 training epochs. The Adam $\beta_{1}$ and Adam $\beta_{2}$ are 0.9 and 0.999 , respectively and the weight decay is set to be $1 \mathrm{e}-4$.

Baselines and tasks. For the task of ODE simulations, we first compute FMint's improvement of the initialization of coarse solutions. Then we compare against three baselines: Neural ODE [65], NeurVec [11], and In-Context Operator Networks (ICON-LM) [24]. Neural ODEs model continuoustime dynamics by parameterizing the derivative of the hidden state with a neural network. This approach turns the forward pass into solving an initial value problem, offering a memory-efficient way to capture temporal patterns in data. NeurVec is a deep learning-based corrector aimed to compensate for integration errors and enable larger time step sizes in simulations. Based on the decoder-only transformer architecture, ICON-LM uses in-context learning for operator learning. Since the problem setting in ICON-LM is different from ours, we adapt our inputs tokens to their format with initial values as conditions and fine-grained ODEs as QoIs. ICON-LM is a multi-task model trained on a large collection of examples while both Neural ODE and NeurVec fit one neural network per example. The configuration and training details of Neural ODE and NeurVec are provided in the Appendix A. 2 A. 3 .

Evaluation metrics. We use the mean relative errors (MRE) and root mean square errors (RMSE) compared to fine-grained ODE solutions as the evaluation metric:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{MRE}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\left|\tilde{u}^{i}-u^{i}\right|}{\left|u^{i}\right|}, \text { and } \quad \text { RMSE }=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\|\tilde{u}^{i}-u^{i}\right\|_{2}} \tag{8}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\tilde{u}^{i}$ is the predicted ODE solution for the i-th equation. For FMint, it can be computed via $\tilde{u}_{k}^{i}=\hat{u}_{k}^{i}+\hat{e r r}^{i} . \hat{u}_{k}^{i}$ is the coarse solution of the i-th equation, and errr ${ }^{i}$ is the model output by FMint.

### 4.2 In-distribution performance

Here we evaluate FMint on the test split of the pretraining dataset. This contains ODEs from the same ODE families with the same parameter range, but have different random parameters within the range and different initial conditions. MRE and RMSE results are shown in Table 3 for all in-distribution

Normalized runtime for Lotka-Volterra of reference solution (RK4-FINE) obtained by using RK4 with step size 5e-3, coarse solution (RK4COARSE) is simulated with using RK4 with time step 1 and FMint.

ODE families. Compared to the initialized coarse solutions, FMint is able to improve the accuracy of simulation with at least two order of magnitude using both metrics for all six families.

FMint in general outperforms all other baselines except for Pendulum gravity where NeurVec has slightly better precision. Noticeably that we outperform task specific baselines Neural ODE for all ODE families and NeurVec for five out of six ODE families. This shows the benefit and possibility of training a multifaceted neural network for physical systems rather than specialized ones for each example. Conditioning on the initialization of coarse solutions, FMint outperforms ICON-LM on all examples using both metrics, mostly by one order of magnitude. This illustrates the importance of utilizing results from human-designed algorithms that provide information of essential physics. As an illustration, we visualize the output of FMint on example of Lotka-Volterra in Figure 2a and include the visualization of the rest examples in Appendix A. 4

In addition, we display the runtime of FMint in comparison with fine solution generation using RK4. The test is conducted on Lotka-Volterra system with 500 equations and we report the result in Figure $2 \mathrm{~b}$ To display the runtime better, we use the runtime for obtaining coarse solutions using RK4 as one unit. FMint is able to attain results with comparable accuracy to the fine solutions (RK-FINE) using less than $20 \%$ of its time.

### 4.3 Out-of-distribution

Unseen ODE families. We use exponential decay (1D) and driven damped pendulum (2D) as our unseen ODE families. We evaluate the transfer performance of FMint using training trajectories of size $N \in\{0,1000,5000,10000\}$ for each example. For $N=0$, we directly assess FMint without updating any model parameter and hence reflects the transfer performance under zero-shot setting. For $N \in\{1000,5000,10000\}$, we fine-tune the model for 500 iterations on the new training data of size $N$ and report the RMSE on the test examples. As a comparison, RMSEs are computed for NeurVec and Neural ODE using training set of size $50 \mathrm{~K}$.

(b) NeurVec

Figure 3: We compare the simulation results by FMint and NeurVec on a driven damped pendulum. FMint shows superior accuracy on this non-autonomous system, even when pre-trained only on autonomous systems, while NeurVec fails to provide correct simulation.

The results are shown in Table 4 For both ODE families, the prediction error of FMint decreases as the training sample size increases. Even the error for zero-shot results are better than that of NeurVec and Neural ODE. FMint demonstrates superior generalization ability; unlike the autonomous systems in the training dataset, the driven damped pendulum is a non-autonomous dynamical system, which poses a significant simulation challenge. As shown in Figure 3. NeurVec and Neural ODE fail to simulate such non-autonomous dynamical systems. However, FMint still achieves superior accuracy, thanks to its innovative input token design and the in-context learning scheme. This demonstrates that FMint has great potential for large-scale simulations in many real-world scenarios where data collection are expensive and training from scratch are almost impossible.

Unseen coefficients range. We also consider ODEs from the same families in the training set but with different range of coefficients to test the generalization ability of FMint. We choose the damped harmonic oscillator system with $\zeta \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(0.02,0.04)$ and $\omega \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(7.5,12.5)$ as our test examples. In the training data, we used $\zeta \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(0.01,0.02)$ and $\omega \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(5,10)$. The modified system is more challenging due to the higher frequency oscillations. The results are shown in the last column of Table 4 The zero-shot performance of our model remains competitive with NeurVec and Neural ODE trained on 50,000 ODEs. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with more training data, the accuracy of FMint further improves. This demonstrates the robust generalization capability of our model to even more challenging out-of-distribution systems.

Table 4: Zero- and few-shot transfer performance of FMint on unseen ODEs and unseen coefficients in RMSE. Our zero-shot results outperform NeurVec and Neural ODE trained from scratch.

Unseen strides. We show here the zero-shot performance of our pre-trained model on test data generated with smaller or larger strides $k$ without further training. This examines how adaptable FMint is to handle realistic circumstances in which the coarse solution simulation varies during inference stage. The strides for each ODE families used for training are shown in Table 2. For consistency over various families, we generate test examples with new stride values proportional to the training strides: $\alpha k, \alpha=\{0.75,1.5\}$.

Table 5 reports the improvement on the accuracy of simulation through MRE and RMSE of FMint and coarse solutions. When tested on examples with smaller stride values with $\alpha=0.75$, FMint is able to decrease the error by one order of magnitude for ODEs except for the damped oscillator and pendulum gravity. For initialization generated with larger strides $\alpha=1.5$, FMint improves the

accuracy by an order of magnitude except for the damped oscillator and falling object. This may due to the fact that in a damped oscillator, though oscillatory motion is preserved, the amplitude decreases over time.

### 4.4 Ablation studies

We further conduct an ablation study to show that for in-distribution ODEs with different parameters, one demo is enough for FMint to achieve the same level of accuracy as shown in Table 3 during the inference stage. We show it by inspecting the impact of the number of demos on the accuracy of FMint. We used five demos during training and here we compare the RMSE with respect to the number of demos $d \in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. The results are averaged over 500 test examples in each ODE family and are shown in Figure 10

## 5 Conclusion and discussions

In this paper, we presented FMint, a novel pre-trained model that speeds up large-scale simulations of dynamical systems via error correction. Based on the architecture of decoder-only transformer, FMint incorporates the in-context learning for a universal error corrector for ODEs from given prompted sequences of coarse initialized solutions. It is pre-trained using a diverse set of ODE families in one to two-dimensional space, with various coefficients and initial conditions.

We show that FMint achieves a significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators and accelerates traditional integration schemes. In comparison to direct ODE solvers, we recognize the importance of integrating the strengths of human-designed algorithms and data-driven methods for the simulation of dynamical systems. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on autonomous dynamical systems, FMint generalizes to non-autonomous systems, a feat where both Neural ODE and NeurVec models fall short. This is likely because the design of the key-value token pairs, wherein the key encodes the temporal information of the coarse solutions. The in-context learning scheme then enables it to effectively interpolate to arbitrary time points, enhancing its versatility in handling temporal dynamics.

Currently, FMint can only handle 1D and 2D ODE systems while in real-life situations, highdimensional ODEs are prevalent. However, it is straightforward to adapt it for higher-order systems by adjusting the token length, albeit at the expense of increased computational cost. As we continue to develop and refine FMint, future research will focus on expanding its applicability to even more complex systems and exploring the potential synergies with other machine learning techniques.

#### Abstract

Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT$4 \mathrm{~V}$, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image. These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: "list items one by one," which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of "list items one by one" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zzxslp/SoM-LLaVA.


## 1 Introduction

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023a) show strong performance in multimodal perception and reasoning, enabling various new capabilities (Yang et al. 2023b). Among these, Set-of-Mark Prompting (SoM) (Yang et al., 2023a) is an interesting new working mode that enhances the connection between visual objects and textual tokens via visual prompting, i.e., placing alphanumeric tags on input images. It provides a natural interface for human-computer interaction, by linking visual locations to executable actions through visual tags, and enables various applications such as GUI navigation (Yan et al., 2023b) and robot interaction (Lin et al., 2023a). Furthermore, GPT-4V with SoM (Yang et al., 2023a) can implicitly align visual objects with their corresponding tags. Such alignments (Li et al. | 2020; Yang et al. | 2021) allow MLLMs to leverage index numbers to perform multi-hop visual reasoning (Yang et al., 2023a, Wei et al. 2022), thereby improving their abilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks.

Despite the significant interest in SoM prompting and its broad applications, it remains unclear why GPT-4V can benefit from SoM prompting, We find that other MLLMs, including the state-ofthe-art open-sourced models such as LLaVA-v1.5 (Liu et al., 2024), and commercial systems like Gemini (Team et al., 2023), struggle to understand SoM prompts. This gap prevents them from leveraging the effectiveness of SoM prompting. In this study, we aim to deepen the understanding of SoM, with a goal of facilitating arbitrary MLLMs to benefit from it.

We break down SoM prompting into three core capabilities: (1) the ability to identify all tags and read the alphanumeric scene texts written on them; (2) the ability to recognize and pinpoint all objects in

an image; (3) the ability to associate tags with corresponding objects in the image. Despite possessing skills such as OCR and visual recognition to meet the first two capabilities, most MLLMs still fail to fully understand SoM prompts. Therefore, we hypothesize that the crucial missing element is the third capability, associating tags with objects, which requires deliberate training. We further validate that SoM-style data are sparse in common MLLM training sources, and it may be necessary to create a specific dataset.

To facilitate such training, we introduce a new learning paradigm named "list items one by one". We show that by asking MLLMs to comprehensively list all tagged items following the alphanumeric order of visual tags, MLLMs can learn SoM prompting with a small number of item-listing samples. Specifically, we create a tailored dataset, by tagging images with Semantic-SAM (Li et al., 2023c, Yang et al., 2023a), and prompting GPT-4V to generate paired text descriptions. With just $10 \mathrm{k}$ image-text pairs, MLLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023a) can reliably understand SoM tags. Based on this initial finding, we conduct studies to explore the effective recipes to help MLLMs best utilize SoM prompting.

We enhanced MLLMs with this "list items one by one" objective and assess their SoM performance from two aspects: model's ability to recognize and describe the SoM tags, and its ability to use SoM in improving multimodal reasoning ( Figure 1). For the first aspect, we design the tag listing task, which requires MLLMs to list and describe all tags in the image, evaluated by listing accuracy. For the second aspect, we evaluate finetuned models on five MLLM benchmarks, including POPE, MME, SEEDBench, LLaVA-Bench, and MM-Vet, showcasing that MLLMs with SoM can significantly boost the multmodal understanding performance. Moreover, our model trained with SoM data outperforms the original MLLM, even without additional visual tags during inference. This demonstrates the potential of incorporating our proposed dataset and learning paradigm to boost general MLLM training.

Finally, we revisit our original question regarding the working mechanism of SoM. The preliminary hypothesis is that the SoM capability may be related to OCR and the implicit association among text, tags, and objects. With our trained models, specifically SoM-LLaVA, we gain access to model features and attention maps for an in-depth analysis. We visualize the attention map to verify tag association. Compared with the original LLaVA model, SoM-LLaVA indeed learns better visual-tagtext associations, reflected in corresponding attention maps.

Our contributions are summarized as follows.

- We present a new training task and data source named "list items one by one," which effectively bootstraps MLLMs for the SoM visual prompting ability.
- We evaluate our finetuned SoM MLLMs on five multimodal understanding benchmarks, and show improved performance even when SoM tags are removed from the input image.
- We probe the working mechanism of SoM through the trained MLLMs, showcasing the implicit association between visual objects and text tokens when performing SoM prompting.


## 2 Related Work

Visual referring prompting. Other than text prompts, visual referring prompting (Yang et al., 2023b) is another effective approach when interacting with multimodal LLMs, where users directly draw on input images to specify their intent, such as drawing visual pointers or handwriting scene texts. Early studies show that vision-language models can understand visual pointers such as circles (Shtedritski et al. 2023) and dots (Mani et al., 2020). Recent studies (Yang et al., 2023b) show that more powerful multimodal LLMs (OpenAI, 2023a) can handle more complicated prompts such as arrows, boxes, circles, hand drawing, scene text, as well as their combinations. Another major advancement is Set-of-Mark Prompting (SoM) (Yang et al. 2023a), where numbered tags can be placed on images to associate visual objects with text indexed. Its effective visual grounding capability (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014; Yu et al. 2016, Mao et al., 2016) enables various applications (Yan et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023). In this work, we aim to better understand SoM and extend its success from GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023a) to other open-source multimodal LLMs.

Multimodal LLMs. Multimodal LLMs (Alayrac et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023a; Liu et al., 2023b, Li et al., 2023b) extend large language models (OpenAI, 2023b, Gao et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) with visual perception capabilities. Recent studies (Chen et al., 2023) show the effectiveness of training open-source models on the GPT-4V generated detailed description data. Another thread of studies explore having multimodal LLMs predicting object locations as bounding boxes (Wang et al., 2023b; Peng et al. 2023) or masks (Rasheed et al. 2023). In contrast to most prior studies that pair the images with different text instructions, our study explores a new direction of how visual prompts such as SoM can improve multimodal LLMs. Specifically, we show that the SoM visual tags provide fine-grained alignments between visual objects and text tokens, thereby improving various visual reasoning tasks, both with and without SoM prompting during inference.

## 3 Preliminary Examination

### 3.1 Visualizing SoM Prompting on LLaVA

In this section, we first investigate the capacity of LLaVA-1.5 in SoM, concerning its attention sensibility to the numeric IDs tagged on the objects and its answer to the SoM query. We show an example task to list a series of objects tagged with numeric IDs in Figure 2, in which the attention map is extracted from LLaVA-1.5 based on the SoM query (e.g., "I have labeled a bright numeric ID at the center for each visual object in the image. Please enumerate their names."). The top 20 image patches with the highest average attention weights across the user query tokens are highlighted in transparent red regions.

We can observe from the highly attended regions of LLaVA-1.5 that the numeric ID tags can be easily and correctly attended by LLaVA-1.5 along with their associated objects (e.g., bird, vase, and branches). Such capacities in locating numeric ID tags may have been acquired by LLaVA-1.5 from its pretraining tasks in OCR and also benefited from the strong OCR abilities of the ViT feature encoder (Radford et al. 2021) adopted by LLaVA-v1.5. However, the response prompted by the user query in the first example of Figure 2 suggests that LLaVA-1.5 cannot follow the SoM instruction to list all the items. Instead of providing the object descriptions corresponding to all the numeric ID tags, LLaVA-1.5 responds with a general image caption, due to a large portion of image captioning samples in its pretraining stage. From the second example of Figure 2, we can also observe that although LLaVA-1.5 generates a list of tag IDs with object names, it cannot accurately associate the tags to corresponding objects, causing the model to hallucinate the descriptions of these objects.

User: I have labeled a bright numeric ID at the center for each visual object in the image. Please enumerate their names. LLaVA-1.5:

1. A vase with a flower in it. 2. A white flower in the vase 3. The vase is on woodase. 4. The vase is sitinool 4. The vase is sitting on a ledge. 5. The vase is sitting on a fence 6. The vase is sitting on a railing. 7. ... 8. . 9....10... 11. .

Right: Attention map extracted from LLaVA-1.5 on the image of a vase placed on a table, where 7 objects are tagged. However, LLaVA-1.5 lists more than 7 object names that are repetitions of previous object names.

### 3.2 Finding SoM Data in Existing Training Sources

We further look into the pretraining/instruction-tuning (IT) dataset, aiming to inspect if there are text contents with listings, or images with SOM annotations. We examine the pretraining dataset of LLaVA-v1 and v1.5 (Liu et al. 2023b a), and the IT dataset used by LLaVA-v1.5, ShareGPT4V (Chen et al. 2023), and CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023a).

Table 1 shows the source of text in each dataset and the percentage of text content with a listing format. The text in the two pretraining datasets for LLaVA are image captions (either the raw caption or generated by BLIP (Dai et al. 2023)), and we did not find any text with listings in them using our parser. Aside from image captions, the IT dataset also contains instructions related to other visual tasks such as VQA. We noticed that the answers provided by GPT-4(V) models sometimes construct the text in a listing manner (e.g., list out possible reasons for a question, list out observed objects in the image, etc). More examples can be found in Appendix A.6. The instruction-following dataset used by $\operatorname{CogVLM}$ has the highest percentage of text with listings ( $\sim 7 \%$ ). Through our interaction with these models, we also find CogVLM is better at generating listing-style data than LLaVA-1.5.

We add tags to MSCOCO-2017 images following the SoM (Yang et al. 2023a) format, and train a binary classifier with ViT/B-16 (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). We use the classifiers to filter the images in the two LLaVA pretraining datasets, and take the top $2 \mathrm{k}$ images with the highest scores for each dataset. We then manually check the top $2 \mathrm{k}$ images, and found 12 images with tagging in CC3M-595K ( $\sim 0.002 \%$ ), and found 86 images with tagging in LCS-558K ( $\sim 0.015 \%)$. Figure 15 shows a few images with tagging. Given that tagged images are sparse in those datasets and the SoM prompting performance of open-source MLLMs is unsatisfying, it may be worthwhile to design a tailored dataset that empower open-source MLLMs with this emergent ability, similar to what GPT-4V is capable of.

## 4 Dataset Creation and Training

Motivated by the above analysis, in this section, we introduce the pipeline to create our dataset. First, in Section 4.1, we use semantic-SAM to generate semantic visual prompts in the form of numeric tags for each image. We then discuss the learning paradigm of "list items one by one" in Section 4.2 Finally, we use visual prompted images to generate text data in Section 4.3

### 4.1 Image Source and Visual Prompting Generation

There are various open-source image datasets available (Deng et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2014, Schuhmann et al., 2022, Yan et al., 2023a). We use MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014) as the image source to create our SoM dataset, since it contains comprehensive human annotations with bounding boxes, masks, and captions. It has also been widely used for visual instruction tuning (Liu et al., 2023b, Wang et al. 2023a, Chen et al. 2023), which could benefit controlled experiments as well as comparisons with previous work.

The first step is to create visual prompts by placing numeric tags on proper locations. Following SoM (Yang et al., 2023a), we experiment with segmentation models including SEEM (Zou et al. 2023), Semantic-SAM (Li et al., 2023c), and SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023). Empirically, we find that Semantic-SAM provides the annotation granularity that best fits COCO images, and thus use it to create tagged images for our dataset.

### 4.2 A Learning Paradigm: List Items One by One

After obtaining the image data with semantic tags, the next question is how to design the instruction data to best distill the SoM visual prompting ability. A common approach (Liu et al., 2023b, Chen et al. 2023) in multimodal instruction-following data creation is to design and collect "questionanswering" style samples. This is often done by prompting ChatGPT/GPT-4 or alternative open-source models. Given an image $I$ and optional metadata $M_{I}$ such as captions, bounding boxes, various questions or instructions $X_{Q}^{(i)}$ are posed, and the corresponding answers $X_{\mathrm{A}}^{(i)}$ from large models are collected.

However, such general question-answering data may not be the most effective in distilling the desired SoM prompting capability, due to the inadequate mention of objects in text. For SoM prompting, one core ability of interest is to associate numbered tags with visual objects in the image, thereby enabling effective referral of visual objects via text tokens. In a general QA data, however, it is rare for multiple objects to be mentioned, even in an extended multi-turn conversation. To enhance tag association, we propose a simple and effective approach: list items one by one, where the model is asked to comprehensively describe all tagged items within an image. Given an image $I^{\mathrm{T}}$ with $N$ text tags on the image, we ask the model to enumerate all items in numerical order: $\left\{X_{o b j}^{1}, X_{o b j}^{2}, \cdots\right.$, $\left.X_{o b j}^{N}\right\}$, where $X_{o b j}^{j}$ is the textual description of the $j$-th item, tagged by ID $j$ in the image.

Beyond promoting SoM learning, listing items one by one is also effective in general multi-modal LLM training: if a model learns to list items in the images with a specific order (in our case, the order is determined by the visual numeric tags), it gains a comprehensive and fine-grained understanding of images. This could directly benefit visual grounding and reasoning, which we verified through the standard multimodal QA and chat evaluation benchmarks.

Compared with existing visual instruction tuning datasets, such as LLaVA-665K (Liu et al. 2023a) and ShareGPT-4V (Chen et al., 2023), another difference is the implicit spatial information encoded by the visual tags in SoM prompting. Converting images into the language space inevitably loses information, especially spatial locations. For example, "a girl on the right" can only vaguely imply the position of the girl. However, with SoM visual prompting, we provide precise visual guidance on the image. Therefore, our data can be viewed as a form of dense captioning with a new way of encoding spatial information.

### 4.3 Text Data Generation via GPT-4V

With the visual prompting enhanced images, the final step for dataset creation is to generate the corresponding text data. To automate this process, we leverage GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023a) to generate the listing data $\left\{X_{o b j}^{1}, X_{o b j}^{2}, \cdots, X_{o b j}^{N}\right\}$, following the order of visual tags in the images. However, we find that simply prompting the model to list items in a zero-shot manner could lead to noisy and biased generation results, where the model may refer the tag to a distant object that is easy to describe. (see examples in appendix A.4). To mitigate this problem, we seek two complementary solutions: (1) We modify the system message of GPT-4V to avoid assigning tags to distant objects. (2) We

Training samples of listing data grow from 10k to 100k. list + mix-665k is to mix listing data with $665 \mathrm{k}$ instruction tuning data from (Liu et al., 2023a). list+nonocr is to exclude the OCR and text data from the full $665 \mathrm{k}$ data, resulting in $563 \mathrm{k}$ samples. list + ocrtext is to mix listing data with only OCR and text data from the full $665 \mathrm{k}$ data, resulting in $102 \mathrm{k}$ samples. Green-dashed line in Figure $3 \mathrm{a}$ is the zero-shot result from GPT-4V.

manually design a few correct listing samples via human annotations, and use them as seed examples for in-context-learning to query GPT-4V. The details of our template is in Appendix.

In addition to listing, we also consider conversational data similar to LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023b), where GPT-4V is asked to generate mulit-turn question answering between an AI assistant and a person asking questions about the photo. Given a tagged image $I^{T}$, we use GPT-4V to generate instruction-following data in the form of $\left\{\right.$ Person: $I^{\mathrm{T}} X_{Q}^{(i)}$, Assistant: $\left.X_{\mathrm{A}}^{(i)}\right\}$.

### 4.4 Model Training

We take the pretrained stage of LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al. 2023a) as the base model, and continue finetuning by mixing instruction tuning data of LLaVA-1.5 with our collected visual prompting data. For SoM-listing, we create 40 task templates as human instructions (e.g., "please enumerate object names in the tagged image"), and treat them as standard conversational data. We use the same training objective of next-token prediction to train general QA, SoM-QA and SoM-listing data. Specifically, we maximize the conditional log likelihood as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\log p\left(X_{\AA} \mid X_{\mathrm{V}}, X_{Q}\right)=-\log \prod_{i=1}^{L} p_{\Theta}\left(x_{i} \mid I / I^{\mathrm{T}}, X_{Q,<i}, X_{\mathrm{A},<i}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Theta$ are the trainable model parameters, $X_{Q,<i}$ and $X_{A,<i}$ are the instruction and answer tokens in all previous turns of conversations before the current prediction token $x_{i}$. The input image is $I$ or $I^{\mathrm{T}}$ for LLaVA or SoM data, respectively.

## 5 Experiments

### 5.1 Experimental Settings

Experiment overview. We validate the method effectiveness from two aspects. First, in Section 5.2, we benchmark the model's capabilities in understand and describing SoM visual prompting. We design the tag listing task on MS-COCO to test the SoM performance. Second, in Section 5.3 . we evaluate if our dataset and model can benefit visual reasoning tasks, where we consider five representative visual question answering and reasoning tasks detailed as follows.

MLLM benchmarks. We consider the following multimodal LLM benchmarks in Table 2 to validate SoM visual prompting's benefit on visual reasoning. POPE (Li et al. 2023e) is carefully designed to evaluate object hallucination in multimodal LLMs. We follow POPE and report the F1 Score for the binary choice questions. MME (Fu et al., 2023) contains 2800 binary choice questions for perception and cognition evaluation. We report the overall perception score for the evaluated models. SEED-Bench (Li et al. 2023a) contains $19 \mathrm{~K}$ multiple choice questions covering both image and video modality. We follow a previous study (Lin et al. 2023b) that reports the multiple choice accuracy on

Underlined numbers are the second best results in the column. SoM-LLaVA-1.5-T is the model with tagged images as input.

the image subset of 14k images, namely SEED-I. LLaVA-W: LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild) (Liu et al. 2023b) and MM-Vet (Yu et al., 2023) computes the evaluation score by prompting a GPT-4 based evaluator (OpenAI, 2023b) with both the predicted and ground-truth reference answer. The score is then scaled to the range of 0 to 100 . We introduce extra implementation details in appendix A. 1 .

### 5.2 Evaluation on Tag Listing

First, we evaluate model performance on the tag listing task, aiming to answer two research questions: (1) Do model sizes matter in terms of learning SoM ability? (2) How will different sets of extra training data impact the SoM performance? We design the listing data based on images with groundtruth mask annotations from MS-COCO, and enumerate each object with corresponding class name. An example list is "1. person, 2. cat, 3. dog.". We compute list-wise accuracy, where for a caption with $N$ items, the score is $\frac{M}{N}$ with $M$ items predicted correctly by the model. With human annotation of objects in an image, we can automatically create abundant rule-based data (up to 100k) for studying model behaviors and perform quantitative evaluations.

For the first question, we find that larger LLM performs better for the listing task (see Figure 3a), presumably benefiting from the stronger language prior to help learn SoM prompting. For the second question, we decompose the 665k instruction data from LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al. 2023a) into two parts. We find that both general caption-QA data, as well as OCR-text data contribute to learning SoM ability when limited listing data are available (10k). The reason could be that OCR can help with identifying numeric tags, and general caption may help the model to recognize objects within an image, both of them are fundamental abilities required by SoM. In general, other visual instruction data may benefit learning SoM, especially when SoM data is scarce.

Overall, we observe that with only $10 \mathrm{k}$ data, we can outperform zero-shot GPT-4V in listing accuracy, whereas growing data size from $50 \mathrm{k}$ to $100 \mathrm{k}$ only slightly improves the listing performance. These findings suggest that collecting a small amount of data may be sufficient for learning SoM prompting.

### 5.3 Evaluation on MLLM Benchmarks

We then train LLaVA-1.5 on our collected dataset and perform evaluation on MLLM benchmarks. As shown in Table 2, we observe that our SoM-LLaVA-1.5, which is trained with a mixture of LLaVA visual instructions and our SoM data in order to learn SoM prompting, also obtains superior performance on general MLLM tasks. Surprisingly, we find that even without tagged images, SoM-LLaVA still attains strong performance and substantial improvement over the orignal LLaVA. This indicates the quality of our data and the potential of introducing listing data into general MLLM training to improve visual understanding and reasoning, as well as reduce hallucinations. We conjecture the reason that the great performance of SoM-LLaVA on non-tagged images is that "listing items one by one" with visual prompting guides the model to learn fine-grained semantics for image features. Related case studies and visualizations are in appendix A.2 For the performance of open-vocabulary listing, we present examples in appendix A. 3

| Data Composition | Data Size | POPE |  |  | MME |  |  |

| LLaVA-IT | $665 \mathrm{~K}$ | 87.1 | 86.2 | 84.5 | 125.0 | 1531.3 | 68.2 |
| LLaVA-IT + Listing | $665 \mathrm{~K}+\mathbf{1 0 k}$ | 87.3 | 86.3 | 84.8 | $\mathbf{1 4 7 . 5}$ | $\mathbf{1 5 8 8 . 2}$ | 68.9 |
| LLaVA-IT + QA | $695 \mathrm{~N}+\mathbf{2 0 k}$ | 87.5 | 86.4 | 84.7 | 110.0 | 1540.0 | 69.2 |
| LLaVA-IT + Listing + QA | $695 \mathrm{~K}+\mathbf{3 0 k}$ | $\mathbf{8 7 . 8}$ | $\mathbf{8 6 . 7}$ | $\mathbf{8 5 . 2}$ | 140.0 | 1563.1 | $\mathbf{6 9 . 6}$ |
| LLaVA-IT + ShareGPT-4V | $695 \mathrm{~K}+\mathbf{2 0 k}$ | 87.1 | 86.0 | 84.3 | 110.0 | 1528.7 | 69.3 |

Table 3: Comparison for different data mixture strategies. LLaVA-IT is the mix665k visual instruction data from (Liu et al. 2023a). Listing and QA is from our SoM dataset with tagged image-text pairs. ShareGPT-4V is from (Chen et al. 2023) with the same MS-COCO images as our $2 \mathrm{k}$ QA data and detailed captions from GPT-4V.

### 5.4 Ablation Study on Mixture of Datasets

Finally, we perform ablation on different data mixture strategies in Table 3 We consider mixing our listing and QA data generated from Section 4.3 with LLaVA-665k (Liu et al., 2023a), trained separately or together. Empirically, we find that mixing listing and QA data yields the best overall performance. In Section 5.2, we find OCR data can help the learning of listing. Here we also notice that "listing item one by one" can in turn greatly improve the performance of OCR related task. The results on POPE indicates our data leads to lower hallucinations compared with ShareGPT-4V, which is a dense caption dataset without visual prompting. Placing tags on the images can seamlessly encode spatial information into the data for MLLMs to learn fine-grained vision language alignment.

Figure 4: A comparative example of attention maps extracted from LLaVA-1.5 and SoM-LLaVA1.5, where five objects (e.g., laptop, chair, monitor, desk lamp, and printer) are tagged. We highlight the top- 5 most attended image patches of the models on each object's numeric tags individually. SoM-LLaVA is better at attending to objects following numeric text and tags.

### 6.1 Probing Trained Models

We first analyze the tag-listing capacity of SoM-LLaVA-1.5 acquired through fine-tuning. In Figure 4. we show the attention maps on the five tagged objects, which are extracted from SoM-LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-1.5 respectively. The comparative example showcases that although both models can locate their model attention on the mentioned objects to some extent, the fine-tuned SoM-LLaVA-1.5 model can attend to and focus on characteristic regions of the object, which can also be accurately

## Case Study

User:

Whose pants' color is the same as someone else's white shirt?

LLaVA-1.5:

The man wearing brown pants has the same pants color as the woman wearing a white shirt.

SoM-LLaVA-1.5:

The person tagged with number 1 is wearing pants that are the same color as the person tagged with number 9's white shirt.

GPT-4V:

The person labeled with the number 2 is wearing white pants, and their color matches the white shirt of the person labeled with the number 9 .

guided by the numeric ID tags. For example, the comparative attention maps on the object "Laptop" tagged with number 1 show that SoM-LLaVA-1.5 can clearly attend to the mentioned object with its main focus. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 mistakenly attends to the monitor instead of the laptop, due to high similarity between these two objects.

In addition, we also observe that SoM-LLaVA-1.5 can be efficiently guided by the numeric ID tags to focus on the specific object the user refers to, even with multiple similar objects within the image. For example, the attention map of SoM-LLaVA-1.5 on the "Chair" tagged with a number 2 is mostly focusing on the chair on the left-hand side, instead of the similar chair on the right-hand side. SoM prompting in SoM-LLaVA-1.5 with such the capacity to accurately locate the tagged object, enables more flexible and easier user-referring queries without complicated language descriptions. The attention maps also verify our early hypothesis regarding the implicit association among the text, tag, and object in SoM prompting.

### 6.2 Visual Reasoning with SoM Prompting

We present two examples of different models reasoning over the tagged images. In Figure 5, we examine a multi-step visual reasoning question (i.e., "Whose pants' color is the same as someone else's white shirt"), which requires the MLLM to first identify the mentioned objects (i.e., pants and shirt) and compare their visual features (i.e., the same white color). We observe from Figure 5 that LLaVA-1.5 provides an incorrect answer by falsely recognizing the person who wears the white shirt as a female. Such an incorrect answer can be caused by the inferior object recognition capacity in LLaVA-1.5. Similar observation from GPT-4V in Figure 5 showcases that incorrect recognition of the white color of the male's pants can also cause incorrect reasoning conclusions in GPT-4V. In contrast, SoM-LLaVA-1.5 successfully identifies tags 1 and 9 with the same color in those image regions, while recognizing the two objects as white pants and white shirt, respectively. We show another example of tag selection in Figure 6

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we study SoM prompting of multimodal LLMs. We collected a tailored dataset that helps MLLMs acquiring the SoM visual prompting ability. Our approach demonstrates that MLLMs can learn SoM prompting using a small set of GPT-4V generated data, where the text describes the visual objects following the order of tags in the image. We then verify the effectiveness of SoM prompting on general VL reasoning tasks. Our enhanced model, SoM-LLaVA, consistently outperforms the original LLaVA model across five MLLM benchmarks. Our dataset and models will be released to facilitate vision and language research.
