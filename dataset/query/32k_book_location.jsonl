The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Hartman signed it: and Hartman’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Gordon was as dead as a door-nail.\n\nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Gordon was as dead as a door-nail.\n\nHartman knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Hartman and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Hartman was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Hartman was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Gordon’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Gordon was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.\n\nHartman never painted out Old Gordon’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Hartman and Gordon. The firm was known as Hartman and Gordon. Sometimes people new to the business called Hartman Hartman, and sometimes Gordon, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.\n\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Hartman! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Hartman. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Hartman never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Hartman, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Hartman. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”\n\nBut what did Hartman care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” to Hartman.\n\nOnce upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Hartman sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Hartman’s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Hartman had a very small fire, but the clerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn’t replenish it, for Hartman kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n\n“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Nolan, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n“Bah!” said Hartman, “Humbug!”\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Hartman’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Nolan. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n\n“I do,” said Hartman. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\n\nHartman having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Hartman indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n\n“Keep it!” repeated Nolan. “But you don’t keep it.”\n\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Hartman. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n\n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\n\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\n\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Hartman, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”\n\nHartman said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n\n“But why?” cried Nolan. “Why?”\n\n“Why did you get married?” said Hartman.\n\n“Because I fell in love.”\n\n“Because you fell in love!” growled Hartman, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”\n\n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”\n\n“Good afternoon,” said Hartman.\n\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n\n“Good afternoon,” said Hartman.\n\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Hartman.\n\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Hartman.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Hartman; for he returned them cordially.\n\n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Hartman; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Nolan out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Hartman’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\n\n“Hartman and Gordon’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Hartman, or Mr. Gordon?”\n\n“Mr. Gordon has been dead these seven years,” Hartman replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”\n\n“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Hartman frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n\n“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Hartman,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”\n\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Hartman.\n\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Hartman. “Are they still in operation?”\n\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”\n\n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Hartman.\n\n“Both very busy, sir.”\n\n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Hartman. “I’m very glad to hear it.”\n\n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”\n\n“Nothing!” Hartman replied.\n\n“You wish to be anonymous?”\n\n“I wish to be left alone,” said Hartman. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”\n\n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”\n\n“If they would rather die,” said Hartman, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”\n\n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.\n\n“It’s not my business,” Hartman returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Hartman resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Hartman out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Hartman’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n\n“God bless you, merry gentleman!\n  May nothing you dismay!”\n\nHartman seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Hartman dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n\n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Hartman.\n\n“If quite convenient, sir.”\n\n“It’s not convenient,” said Hartman, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n“And yet,” said Hartman, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Hartman, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Hartman walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.\n\nHartman took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker’s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Hartman, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Hartman, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Hartman had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Hartman had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Hartman had not bestowed one thought on Gordon, since his last mention of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Hartman, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a knocker, but Gordon’s face.\n\nGordon’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Hartman as Gordon used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.\n\nAs Hartman looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Gordon’s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Hartman was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Hartman thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Hartman’s dip.\n\nUp Hartman went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Hartman liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Hartman had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Gordon, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Gordon’s head on every one.\n\n“Humbug!” said Hartman; and walked across the room.\n\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\n\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Hartman then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\n\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\n\n“It’s humbug still!” said Hartman. “I won’t believe it.”\n\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Gordon’s Ghost!” and fell again.\n\n\n\n\nGordon’s Ghost\nGordon’s Ghost\n\n\nThe same face: the very same. Gordon in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Hartman observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Hartman, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n\nHartman had often heard it said that Gordon had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n\n“How now!” said Hartman, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”\n\n“Much!”—Gordon’s voice, no doubt about it.\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“Ask me who I was.”\n\n“Who were you then?” said Hartman, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.\n\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Gordon Gordon.”\n\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Hartman, looking doubtfully at him.\n\n“I can.”\n\n“Do it, then.”\n\nHartman asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n\n“I don’t,” said Hartman.\n\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Hartman.\n\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n\n“Because,” said Hartman, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”\n\nHartman was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Hartman felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Hartman could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n\n“You see this toothpick?” said Hartman, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n\n“You are not looking at it,” said Hartman.\n\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n\n“Well!” returned Hartman, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\n\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Hartman held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\n\nHartman fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”\n\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”\n\n“I do,” said Hartman. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”\n\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”\n\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\n\n“You are fettered,” said Hartman, trembling. “Tell me why?”\n\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”\n\nHartman trembled more and more.\n\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”\n\nHartman glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n\n“Jacob Gordon,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Gordon Gordon, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob Gordon!”\n\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Hartman Hartman, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\n\nIt was a habit with Hartman, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob Gordon,” Hartman observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n\n“Seven years dead,” mused Hartman. “And travelling all the time!”\n\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”\n\n“You travel fast?” said Hartman.\n\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Hartman.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob Gordon,” faltered Hartman, who now began to apply this to himself.\n\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business.

The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”\n\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”\n\nHartman was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n\n“I will,” said Hartman. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob Gordon! Pray!”\n\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\n\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Hartman shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer Hartman.”\n\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Hartman. “Thank’ee!”\n\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”\n\nHartman’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.\n\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob Gordon?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n\n“It is.”\n\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Hartman.\n\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”\n\n“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob Gordon?” hinted Hartman.\n\n“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”\n\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Hartman knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\n\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\n\nIt beckoned Hartman to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Gordon’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Hartman stopped.\n\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\n\nHartman followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.\n\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Gordon’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Hartman in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\n\n\n\n\nGhosts of Departed Usurers\n\n\n\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.\n\nHartman closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.\n\n\nSTAVE  TWO.\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS.\nWhen Hartman awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!\n\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Hartman, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”\n\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Hartman Hartman or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.\n\nHartman went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\n\nGordon’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”\n\nHartman lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\n\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“A quarter past,” said Hartman, counting.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“Half-past!” said Hartman.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“A quarter to it,” said Hartman.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“The hour itself,” said Hartman, triumphantly, “and nothing else!”\n\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Hartman, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n\nIt was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n\nEven this, though, when Hartman looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\n\n“Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?” asked Hartman.\n\n“I am!”\n\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\n\n“Who, and what are you?” Hartman demanded.\n\n“I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.”\n\n“Long Past?” inquired Hartman: observant of its dwarfish stature.\n\n“No. Your past.”\n\nPerhaps, Hartman could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n\n“What!” exclaimed the Ghost, “would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow!”\n\nHartman reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully “bonneted” the Spirit at any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\n\n“Your welfare!” said the Ghost.\n\nHartman expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:\n\n“Your reclamation, then. Take heed!”\n\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.\n\n“Rise! and walk with me!”\n\nIt would have been in vain for Hartman to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n\n“I am a mortal,” Hartman remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”\n\n“Bear but a touch of my hand there,” said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”\n\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\n\n“Good Heaven!” said Hartman, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\n\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\n\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”\n\nHartman muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n\n“Remember it!” cried Hartman with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”\n\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”\n\nThey walked along the road, Hartman recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\n\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Hartman knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Hartman? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\n\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\n\nHartman said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Hartman, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Hartman sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Hartman with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n“Why, it’s Zanbu!” Hartman exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Zanbu! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Celso,” said Hartman, “and his wild brother, Brando; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”\n\nTo hear Hartman expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Hartman. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Roland Cruz, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Roland Cruz, where have you been, Roland Cruz?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Sabado, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.\n\n“I wish,” Hartman muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”\n\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n\n“Nothing,” said Hartman. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, “Let us see another Christmas!”\n\nHartman’s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Hartman knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Hartman looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”\n\n“Home, little Cora?” returned the boy.\n\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”\n\n“You are quite a woman, little Cora!” exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Hartman’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Hartman with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Hartman’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n\n“So she had,” cried Hartman. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\n\n“One child,” Hartman returned.\n\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\n\nHartman seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Hartman if he knew it.\n\n“Know it!” said Hartman. “Was I apprenticed here!”\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Hartman cried in great excitement:\n\n“Why, it’s old Brimstone! Bless his heart; it’s Brimstone alive again!”\n\nOld Brimstone laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer Hartman! Hugh!”\n\nHartman’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n\n“Hugh Thornton, to be sure!” said Hartman to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Hugh. Poor Hugh! Dear, dear!”\n\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Brimstone. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Hugh. Christmas, Ebenezer Hartman! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Brimstone, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Brimstone, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Hugh! Chirrup, Ebenezer Hartman!”\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Brimstone looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Brimstone, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Brimstones, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Brimstone, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Brimstone stood out to dance with Mrs. Brimstone. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Brimstone’s Ball\nMr. Brimstone’s Ball\n\n\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Brimstone would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Brimstone. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Brimstone’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Brimstone and Mrs. Brimstone had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Brimstone “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\n\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Brimstone took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time, Hartman had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Hugh were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”\n\n“Small!” echoed Hartman.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Brimstone: and when he had done so, said,\n\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”\n\n“It isn’t that,” said Hartman, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”\n\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n\n“Nothing particular,” said Hartman.\n\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n\n“No,” said Hartman, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Hartman and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n“My time grows short,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”\n\nThis was not addressed to Hartman, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Hartman saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n\n“A golden one.”\n\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Am I?”\n\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am.

No. Never.”\n\n“In what, then?”\n\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\n\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\n\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!”\n\nShe left him, and they parted.\n\n“Spirit!” said Hartman, “show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?”\n\n“One shadow more!” exclaimed the Ghost.\n\n“No more!” cried Hartman. “No more. I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Hartman believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Hartman in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\n\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Hartman looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n“Elara,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n\n“Who was it?”\n\n“Guess!”\n\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Hartman.”\n\n“Mr. Hartman it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n\n“Spirit!” said Hartman in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”\n\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n\n“Remove me!” Hartman exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Hartman observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Hartman pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n\n\n\nHartman Extinguishes the First of the Three Spirits\n\n\n\nSTAVE  THREE.\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS.\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Hartman had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Gordon Gordon’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Hartman quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Hartman’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Hartman’s time, or Gordon’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Hartman, as he came peeping round the door.\n\n“Come in!” exclaimed the Ghost. “Come in! and know me better, man!”\n\nHartman entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged Hartman he had been; and though the Spirit’s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n“I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,” said the Spirit. “Look upon me!”\n\nHartman reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n\n\n\n\nHartman’s Third Visitor\nHartman’s Third Visitor\n\n\n“You have never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n“Never,” Hartman made answer to it.\n\n“Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?” pursued the Phantom.\n\n“I don’t think I have,” said Hartman. “I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?”\n\n“More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.\n\n“A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Hartman.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n\n“Spirit,” said Hartman submissively, “conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.”\n\n“Touch my robe!”\n\nHartman did as he was told, and held it fast.\n\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.\n\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts’ content. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n\nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\n\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\n\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Hartman beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\n\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Hartman.\n\n“There is. My own.”\n\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Hartman.\n\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Hartman.\n\n“Because it needs it most.”\n\n“Spirit,” said Hartman, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”\n\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Hartman. “Wouldn’t you?”\n\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Hartman. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Hartman.\n\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”\n\nHartman promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Hartman had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\n\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Hartman’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Hartman with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Tom Lark’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Lark, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Bea Lark, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Phil Lark plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Phil Lark to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\n\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Lark. “And your brother, Little Leo! And Marie warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n\n“Here’s Marie, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n“Here’s Marie, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Marie!”\n\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Lark, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Lark. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”\n\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Marie, hide!”\n\nSo Marie hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Little Leo upon his shoulder. Alas for Little Leo, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n“Why, where’s our Marie?” cried Tom Lark, looking round.\n\n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Lark.\n\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\n\nMarie didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Little Leo, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Lark, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.\n\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”\n\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Little Leo was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Little Leo before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Phil, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Lark made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Phil mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Bea sweetened up the apple-sauce; Marie dusted the hot plates; Bob took Little Leo beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Lark, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Little Leo, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Lark said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Bea, Mrs. Lark left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Lark entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Tom Lark said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Lark since their marriage. Mrs. Lark said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Tom Lark called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Tom Lark’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n“God bless us every one!” said Little Leo, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n“Spirit,” said Hartman, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Little Leo will live.”\n\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n\n“No, no,” said Hartman. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”\n\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\n\nHartman hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”\n\nHartman bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.\n\n“Mr. Hartman!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Hartman, the Founder of the Feast!”\n\n“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Lark, reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”\n\n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”\n\n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Hartman. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!”\n\n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”\n\n“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. Lark, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!”\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Little Leo drank it last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it.

The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Hartman the Baleful being done with. Tom Lark told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Phil, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Phil’s being a man of business; and Phil himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Marie, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as tall as Phil;” at which Phil pulled up his collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Little Leo, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Phil might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Hartman had his eye upon them, and especially on Little Leo, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Hartman and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\n\n“What place is this?” asked Hartman.\n\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Hartman hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Hartman’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Hartman, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\n\nIt was a great surprise to Hartman, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Hartman, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Hartman to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Nolan. “Ha, ha, ha!”\n\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Nolan, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.\n\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Nolan laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Hartman’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Nolan. “He believed it too!”\n\n“More shame for him, Nolan!” said Hartman’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.\n\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Nolan, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”\n\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Nolan,” hinted Hartman’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n\n“What of that, my dear!” said Nolan. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”\n\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Hartman’s niece. Hartman’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n\n“Oh, I have!” said Nolan. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Hartman’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Nolan, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Pelle?”\n\nPelle had clearly got his eye upon one of Hartman’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Hartman’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.\n\n“Do go on, Nolan,” said Hartman’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”\n\nNolan revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n\n“I was only going to say,” said Nolan, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Hartman, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Hartman. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\n\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Pelle, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Hartman’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Hartman from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Gordon Gordon.\n\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Pelle was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Nolan; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\n\nHartman’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Hartman were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Nolan, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Pelle could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Hartman; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Hartman; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\n\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n\n“Here is a new game,” said Hartman. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”\n\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Nolan had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Nolan! I know what it is!”\n\n“What is it?” cried Nolan.\n\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\n\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Hartman, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.\n\n“He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,” said Nolan, “and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, ‘Uncle Hartman!’ ”\n\n“Well! Uncle Hartman!” they cried.\n\n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!” said Nolan. “He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Hartman!”\n\nUncle Hartman had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Hartman his precepts.\n\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Hartman had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Hartman remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Hartman had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\n\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Hartman.\n\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”\n\n“To-night!” cried Hartman.\n\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\n\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Hartman, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\n\n\n\n\nIgnorance and Want\n\n\n\nHartman started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n“Spirit! are they yours?” Hartman could say no more.\n\n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”\n\n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Hartman.\n\n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”\n\nThe bell struck twelve.\n\nHartman looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Gordon Gordon, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE  FOUR.\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS.\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Hartman bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” said Hartman.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,” Hartman pursued. “Is that so, Spirit?”\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Hartman feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\n\nBut Hartman was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.\n\n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?”\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n“Lead on!” said Hartman. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Hartman followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Hartman had seen them often.\n\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Hartman advanced to listen to their talk.\n\n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”\n\n“When did he die?” inquired another.\n\n“Last night, I believe.”\n\n“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d never die.”\n\n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.\n\n“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n\n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin, yawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I know.”\n\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n\n“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”\n\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”\n\nAnother laugh.\n\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”\n\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Hartman knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\n\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Hartman listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\n\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n\n“How are you?” said one.\n\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”\n\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”\n\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”\n\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\n\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\n\nHartman was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob Gordon, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\n\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Hartman had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\n\nHartman and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Sam, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”\n\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Sam, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Smith?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”\n\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”\n\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’", "context_order": 3, "question": "What did the first speaker say when asked what was the matter with the deceased person?", "answer": "God knows."}

We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”\n\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Smith and the man together. “We should hope not.”\n\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”\n\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Smith, laughing.\n\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Smith. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Sam, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Sam.”\n\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Sam, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n\n“That’s your account,” said Sam, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\n\nMrs. Smith was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Sam. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”\n\n“And now undo my bundle, Sam,” said the first woman.\n\nSam went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n\n“What do you call this?” said Sam. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Sam.\n\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Sam, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Sam,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”\n\n“His blankets?” asked Sam.\n\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Sam, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Sam.\n\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\n\nHartman listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Sam, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”\n\n“Spirit!” said Hartman, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.\n\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Hartman glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\n\nHartman glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Hartman’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.\n\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\n\nNo voice pronounced these words in Hartman’s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Hartman did not dare to think.\n\n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”\n\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n\n“I understand you,” Hartman returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”\n\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n\n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Hartman quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”\n\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.\n\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\n\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.\n\n“Bad,” he answered.\n\n“We are quite ruined?”\n\n“No. There is hope yet, Linette.”\n\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\n\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.\n\n“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Linette!”\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.\n\n“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said Hartman; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.”\n\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Hartman looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Tom Lark’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\n\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Phil, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”\n\nWhere had Hartman heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\n\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\n\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\n\nThe colour? Ah, poor Little Leo!\n\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”\n\n“Past it rather,” Phil answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”\n\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Little Leo upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n\n“And so have I,” cried Phil. “Often.”\n\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”\n\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”\n\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Lark and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”\n\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\n\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Nolan, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”\n\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n\n“Everybody knows that!” said Phil.\n\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Little Leo, and felt with us.”\n\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Lark.\n\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Phil a better situation.”\n\n“Only hear that, Phil,” said Mrs. Lark.\n\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Phil will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n\n“Get along with you!” retorted Phil, grinning.\n\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Little Leo—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”\n\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Little Leo in doing it.”\n\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\n\nMrs. Lark kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Phil and himself shook hands. Spirit of Little Leo, thy childish essence was from God!\n\n“Spectre,” said Hartman, “something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?”\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before—though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Hartman to tarry for a moment.\n\n“This court,” said Hartman, “through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”\n\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n\n“The house is yonder,” Hartman exclaimed. “Why do you point away?”\n\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\n\nHartman hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\n\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.\n\nA churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!\n\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n\n“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Hartman, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”\n\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n\n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Hartman. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!”\n\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\n\nHartman crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Hartman Hartman.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last of the Spirits\nThe Last of the Spirits\n\n\n“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.\n\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n\n“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!”\n\nThe finger still was there.\n\n“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”\n\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n\n“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!”\n\nThe kind hand trembled.\n\n“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!”\n\nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\n\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n\n\nSTAVE  FIVE.\nTHE END OF IT.\nYes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in!\n\n“I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!” Hartman repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. “The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Gordon Gordon! Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob Gordon; on my knees!”\n\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.\n\n“They are not torn down,” cried Hartman, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, “they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!”\n\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.\n\n“I don’t know what to do!” cried Hartman, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”\n\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.\n\n“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried Hartman, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Gordon Gordon entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”\n\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!\n\n“I don’t know what day of the month it is!” said Hartman. “I don’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t know anything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. I’d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”\n\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\n\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\n\n“What’s to-day!” cried Hartman, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\n\n“Eh?” returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\n\n“What’s to-day, my fine fellow?” said Hartman.\n\n“To-day!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas Day.”\n\n“It’s Christmas Day!” said Hartman to himself. “I haven’t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!”\n\n“Hallo!” returned the boy.\n\n“Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the corner?” Hartman inquired.\n\n“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.\n\n“An intelligent boy!” said Hartman. “A remarkable boy! Do you know whether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?—Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?”\n\n“What, the one as big as me?” returned the boy.\n\n“What a delightful boy!” said Hartman. “It’s a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!”\n\n“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy.\n\n“Is it?” said Hartman. “Go and buy it.”\n\n“Walk-er!” exclaimed the boy.\n\n“No, no,” said Hartman, “I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell ’em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and I’ll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I’ll give you half-a-crown!”\n\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\n\n“I’ll send it to Tom Lark’s!” whispered Hartman, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. “He sha’n’t know who sends it. It’s twice the size of Little Leo. Sam Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob’s will be!”\n\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer’s man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.\n\n“I shall love it, as long as I live!” cried Hartman, patting it with his hand. “I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!”\n\nIt was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird. He would have snapped ’em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\n\n“Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,” said Hartman. “You must have a cab.”\n\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.\n\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don’t dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n\nHe dressed himself “all in his best,” and at last got out into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Hartman regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, “Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!” And Hartman said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, “Hartman and Gordon’s, I believe?” It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n\n“My dear sir,” said Hartman, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands. “How do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!”\n\n“Mr. Hartman?”\n\n“Yes,” said Hartman. “That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness”—here Hartman whispered in his ear.\n\n“Lord bless me!” cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away. “My dear Mr. Hartman, are you serious?”\n\n“If you please,” said Hartman. “Not a farthing less. A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favour?”\n\n“My dear sir,” said the other, shaking hands with him. “I don’t know what to say to such munifi—”\n\n“Don’t say anything, please,” retorted Hartman. “Come and see me. Will you come and see me?”\n\n“I will!” cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.\n\n“Thank’ee,” said Hartman. “I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty times. Bless you!”\n\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew’s house.\n\nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:\n\n“Is your master at home, my dear?” said Hartman to the girl. Nice girl! Very.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Where is he, my love?” said Hartman.\n\n“He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll show you up-stairs, if you please.”\n\n“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Hartman, with his hand already on the dining-room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”\n\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\n\n“Nolan!” said Hartman.\n\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Hartman had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.\n\n“Why bless my soul!” cried Nolan, “who’s that?”\n\n“It’s I. Your uncle Hartman. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in, Nolan?”\n\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same. So did Pelle when he came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Tom Lark coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.\n\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Hartman sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o’clock.\n\n“Hallo!” growled Hartman, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?”\n\n“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”\n\n“You are?” repeated Hartman. “Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please.”\n\n“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.”\n\n“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Hartman, “I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I am about to raise your salary!”\n\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Hartman down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n\n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Hartman, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Tom Lark!”\n\nHartman and Tom Lark\n\nHartman was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Little Leo, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.\n\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Little Leo observed, God bless Us, Every One!\n", "context_order": 4, "question": "What was Hartman's initial reaction upon seeing his own name on the gravestone?", "answer": "He fell to his knees and cried in disbelief."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Bartleby, The Scrivener.txt", "context": "I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Quimby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Quimby nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Quimby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Quimby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.\n\nEre introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employés, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.\n\nImprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men’s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late Samuel Pendergast, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late Samuel Pendergast; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late Samuel Pendergast’s good opinion.\n\nSome time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my avocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct in the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new Constitution, as a—premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short years. But this is by the way.\n\nMy chambers were up stairs at No.—Wall-street. At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom. This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call “life.” But if so, the view from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.\n\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Quimby, I had two persons as copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Wellington; second, Hatcher; third, Pippin. These may seem names, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters. Wellington was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o’clock, meridian—his dinner hour—it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals; and continued blazing—but, as it were, with a gradual wane—till 6 o’clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with the like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which was the fact, that exactly when Wellington displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table, boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like him. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all the time before twelve o’clock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched—for these reasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however, because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent. Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o’clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after twelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how indispensable, then, in the afternoon?\n\n“With submission, sir,” said Wellington on this occasion, “I consider myself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!”—and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.\n\n“But the blots, Wellington,” intimated I.\n\n“True,—but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old. Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs. Old age—even if it blot the page—is honorable. With submission, sir, we both are getting old.”\n\nThis appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, I saw that go he would not. So I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers.\n\nHatcher, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers—ambition and indigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal documents. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions, hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked. Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Hatcher could never get this table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention would answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was, Hatcher knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to be rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Hatcher, like his compatriot Wellington, was a very useful man to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Wellington, I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But while the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time. As Hatcher once observed, Wellington’s money went chiefly for red ink. One winter day I presented Wellington with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Wellington would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Wellington felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed.\n\nThough concerning the self-indulgent habits of Wellington I had my own private surmises, yet touching Hatcher I was well persuaded that whatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Hatcher would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for Hatcher, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.\n\nIt was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause—indigestion—the irritability and consequent nervousness of Hatcher, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that Wellington’s paroxysms only coming on about twelve o’clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Hatcher’ was on, Wellington’s was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances.\n\nPippin, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old. His father was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart, before he died. So he sent him to my office as student at law, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much. Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble science of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among the employments of Pippin, as well as one which he discharged with the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Wellington and Hatcher. Copying law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Pippin very frequently for that peculiar cake—small, flat, round, and very spicy—after which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when business was but dull, Wellington would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafers—indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny—the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Wellington, was his once moistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me by making an oriental bow, and saying—“With submission, sir, it was generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account.”\n\nNow my original business—that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts—was considerably increased by receiving the master’s office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now—pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Quimby.\n\nAfter a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have among my corp", "context_order": 0, "question": "What nickname did the narrator and his clerks give to the youthful office boy who worked for him?", "answer": "Pippin."}

According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign Quimby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Quimby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.\n\nAt first Quimby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his application, had he been cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.\n\nIt is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener’s business to verify the accuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or more scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this examination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original. It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Randolph would have contentedly sat down with Quimby to examine a law document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.\n\nNow and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in comparing some brief document myself, calling Wellington or Hatcher for this purpose. One object I had in placing Quimby so handy to me behind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions. It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Quimby. In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Quimby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.\n\nIn this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it was I wanted him to do—namely, to examine a small paper with me. Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, Quimby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, “I would prefer not to.”\n\nI sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Quimby had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, “I would prefer not to.”\n\n“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the room with a stride. “What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you to help me compare this sheet here—take it,” and I thrust it towards him.\n\n“I would prefer not to,” said he.\n\nI looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises. But as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I stood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my desk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my future leisure. So calling Hatcher from the other room, the paper was speedily examined.\n\nA few days after this, Quimby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a week’s testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I called Wellington, Hatcher and Pippin from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original. Accordingly Wellington, Hatcher and Pippin had taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to Quimby to join this interesting group.\n\n“Quimby! quick, I am waiting.”\n\nI heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.\n\n“What is wanted?” said he mildly.\n\n“The copies, the copies,” said I hurriedly. “We are going to examine them. There”—and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.\n\n“I would prefer not to,” he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.\n\nFor a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of my seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.\n\n“Why do you refuse?”\n\n“I would prefer not to.”\n\nWith any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But there was something about Quimby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.\n\n“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to you, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is common usage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you not speak? Answer!”\n\n“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.\n\n“You are decided, then, not to comply with my request—a request made according to common usage and common sense?”\n\nHe briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound. Yes: his decision was irreversible.\n\nIt is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith. He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the other side. Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.\n\n“Wellington,” said I, “what do you think of this? Am I not right?”\n\n“With submission, sir,” said Wellington, with his blandest tone, “I think that you are.”\n\n“Hatcher,” said I, “what do you think of it?”\n\n“I think I should kick him out of the office.”\n\n(The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being morning, Wellington’s answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Hatcher replies in ill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous sentence, Hatcher’ ugly mood was on duty and Wellington’s off.)\n\n“Pippin,” said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf, “what do you think of it?”\n\n“I think, sir, he’s a little luny,” replied Pippin with a grin.\n\n“You hear what they say,” said I, turning towards the screen, “come forth and do your duty.”\n\nBut he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But once more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out to examine the papers without Quimby, though at every page or two, Wellington deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common; while Hatcher, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the screen. And for his (Hatcher’) part, this was the first and the last time he would do another man’s business without pay.\n\nMeanwhile Quimby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there.\n\nSome days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven o’clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Pippin would advance toward the opening in Quimby’s screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat. The boy would then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.\n\nHe lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly speaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Quimby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon Quimby. Probably he preferred it should have none.\n\nNothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment. Even so, for the most part, I regarded Quimby and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend Quimby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable with me. The passiveness of Quimby sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:\n\n“Quimby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you.”\n\n“I would prefer not to.”\n\n“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\n\nNo answer.\n\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Wellington and Hatcher, exclaimed in an excited manner—\n\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think of it, Wellington?”\n\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Wellington sat glowing like a brass boiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.\n\n“Think of it?” roared Wellington; “I think I’ll just step behind his screen, and black his eyes for him!”\n\nSo saying, Wellington rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position. He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Wellington’s combativeness after dinner.\n\n“Sit down, Wellington,” said I, “and hear what Hatcher has to say. What do you think of it, Hatcher? Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing Quimby?”\n\n“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Wellington and myself. But it may only be a passing whim.”\n\n“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind then—you speak very gently of him now.”\n\n“All beer,” cried Wellington; “gentleness is effects of beer—Hatcher and I dined together to-day. You see how gentle I am, sir. Shall I go and black his eyes?”\n\n“You refer to Quimby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Wellington,” I replied; “pray, put up your fists.”\n\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Quimby. I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I remembered that Quimby never left the office.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, “Pippin is away; just step round to the Post Office, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there is any thing for me.”\n\n“I would prefer not to.”\n\n“You will not?”\n\n“I prefer not.”\n\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?\n\n“Quimby!”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Quimby,” in a louder tone.\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Quimby,” I roared.\n\nLike a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\n\n“Go to the next room, and tell Hatcher to come to me.”\n\n“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.\n\n“Very good, Quimby,” said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended something of the kind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.\n\nShall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Quimby, and a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Wellington and Hatcher, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Quimby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not to—in other words, that he would refuse pointblank.\n\nAs days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Quimby. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was this,—he was always there;—first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him.

Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon Quimby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, “I prefer not to,” was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness—such unreasonableness. However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.\n\nHere it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by Wellington for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.\n\nNow, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk around to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Quimby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, and—preferred not admitting me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.\n\nNow, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Quimby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Quimby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Quimby was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Quimby was an eminently decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Quimby that forbade the supposition that he would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.\n\nNevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. Quimby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Quimby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat of a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Quimby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor’s hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Quimby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!\n\nFor the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a not-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Quimby were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad fancyings—chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain—led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of Quimby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener’s pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.\n\nSuddenly I was attracted by Quimby’s closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.\n\nI mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within. Every thing was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings’ bank.\n\nI now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Wellington, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.\n\nRevolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Quimby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.\n\nI did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Quimby. Finally, I resolved upon this;—I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.\n\nThe next morning came.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.\n\nNo reply.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, in a still gentler tone, “come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do—I simply wish to speak to you.”\n\nUpon this he noiselessly slid into view.\n\n“Will you tell me, Quimby, where you were born?”\n\n“I would prefer not to.”\n\n“Will you tell me any thing about yourself?”\n\n“I would prefer not to.”\n\n“But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me? I feel friendly towards you.”\n\nHe did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my head.\n\n“What is your answer, Quimby?” said I, after waiting a considerable time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.\n\n“At present I prefer to give no answer,” he said, and retired into his hermitage.\n\nIt was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion nettled me. Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain calm disdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.\n\nAgain I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my offices, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind. At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: “Quimby, never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:—say so, Quimby.”\n\n“At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,” was his mildly cadaverous reply.\n\nJust then the folding-doors opened, and Hatcher approached. He seemed suffering from an unusually bad night’s rest, induced by severer indigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Quimby.\n\n“Prefer not, eh?” gritted Hatcher—“I’d prefer him, if I were you, sir,” addressing me—“I’d prefer him; I’d give him preferences, the stubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he prefers not to do now?”\n\nQuimby moved not a limb.\n\n“Hatcher,” said I, “I’d prefer that you would withdraw for the present.”\n\nSomehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word “prefer” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper aberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining me to summary means.\n\nAs Hatcher, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Wellington blandly and deferentially approached.\n\n“With submission, sir,” said he, “yesterday I was thinking about Quimby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers.”\n\n“So you have got the word too,” said I, slightly excited.\n\n“With submission, what word, sir,” asked Wellington, respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing, making me jostle the scrivener. “What word, sir?”\n\n“I would prefer to be left alone here,” said Quimby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy.\n\n“That’s the word, Wellington,” said I—“that’s it.”\n\n“Oh, prefer? oh yes—queer word. I never use it myself. But, sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer—”\n\n“Wellington,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”\n\n“Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”\n\nAs he opened the folding-door to retire, Hatcher at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer. It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue. I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man, who already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of myself and clerks. But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission at once.\n\nThe next day I noticed that Quimby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.\n\n“Why, how now? what next?” exclaimed I, “do no more writing?”\n\n“No more.”\n\n“And what is the reason?”\n\n“Do you not see the reason for yourself,” he indifferently replied.\n\nI looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed. Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision.\n\nI was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air. This, however, he did not do. A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Quimby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office. But he blankly declined. So, much to my inconvenience, I went myself.\n\nStill added days went by. Whether Quimby’s eyes improved or not, I could not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had permanently given up copying.\n\n“What!” exclaimed I; “suppose your eyes should get entirely well—better than ever before—would you not copy then?”\n\n“I have given up copying,” he answered, and slid aside.\n\nHe remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay—if that were possible—he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, ", "context_order": 2, "question": "What was Quimby doing in the office on Sunday morning when the narrator discovered him?", "answer": "He was deeply engaged in something and preferred not to admit the narrator."}

I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Quimby that in six days’ time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Quimby,” added I, “I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember.”\n\nAt the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Quimby was there.\n\nI buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, “The time has come; you must quit this place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.”\n\n“I would prefer not,” he replied, with his back still towards me.\n\n“You must.”\n\nHe remained silent.\n\nNow I had an unbounded confidence in this man’s common honesty. He had frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs. The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, “I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.—Will you take it?” and I handed the bills towards him.\n\nBut he made no motion.\n\n“I will leave them here then,” putting them under a weight on the table. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned and added—“After you have removed your things from these offices, Quimby, you will of course lock the door—since every one is now gone for the day but you—and if you please, slip your key underneath the mat, so that I may have it in the morning. I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter. Good-bye, Quimby, and fare you well.”\n\nBut he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple, he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted room.\n\nAs I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Quimby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Quimby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly bidding Quimby depart—as an inferior genius might have done—I assumed the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my doubts,—I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning. My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.—but only in theory. How it would prove in practice—there was the rub. It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Quimby’s departure; but, after all, that assumption was simply my own, and none of Quimby’s. The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do. He was more a man of preferences than assumptions.\n\nAfter breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities pro and con. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Quimby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty. And so I kept veering about. At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.\n\n“I’ll take odds he doesn’t,” said a voice as I passed.\n\n“Doesn’t go?—done!” said I, “put up your money.”\n\nI was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore no reference to Quimby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty. In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were debating the same question with me. I passed on, very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary absent-mindedness.\n\nAs I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood listening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the knob. The door was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be vanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success. I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which Quimby was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from within—“Not yet; I am occupied.”\n\nIt was Quimby.\n\nI was thunderstruck. For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in mouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by a summer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one touched him, when he fell.\n\n“Not gone!” I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which ascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,—this too I could not think of. What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could assume in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Quimby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Quimby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It was hardly possible that Quimby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the matter over with him again.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, “I am seriously displeased. I am pained, Quimby. I had thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would have suffice—in short, an assumption. But it appears I am deceived. Why,” I added, unaffectedly starting, “you have not even touched that money yet,” pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.\n\nHe answered nothing.\n\n“Will you, or will you not, quit me?” I now demanded in a sudden passion, advancing close to him.\n\n“I would prefer not to quit you,” he replied, gently emphasizing the not.\n\n“What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you pay my taxes? Or is this property yours?”\n\nHe answered nothing.\n\n“Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step round to the post-office? In a word, will you do any thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?”\n\nHe silently retired into his hermitage.\n\nI was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations. Quimby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Ellis and the still more unfortunate Wheeler in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Wheeler, being dreadfully incensed by Ellis, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act—an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have terminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associations—an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of appearance;—this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Wheeler.\n\nBut when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Quimby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principle—a great safeguard to its possessor. Men have committed murder for jealousy’s sake, and anger’s sake, and hatred’s sake, and selfishness’ sake, and spiritual pride’s sake; but no man that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity’s sake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct. Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don’t mean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.\n\nI endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to comfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Quimby, of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past twelve o’clock came; Wellington began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Hatcher abated down into quietude and courtesy; Pippin munched his noon apple; and Quimby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge it? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.\n\nSome days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into “Edwards on the Will,” and “Priestly on Necessity.” Under the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Quimby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom. Yes, Quimby, stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here. At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, Quimby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.\n\nI believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous. Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Quimby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him. Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Quimby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room. So after contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.\n\nAlso, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing Quimby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentleman’s) office and fetch some papers for him. Thereupon, Quimby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus.\n\nEre revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Quimby the propriety of his permanent departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his careful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to meditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination remained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.\n\nWhat shall I do? I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last button. What shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I should do with this man, or rather ghost. Rid myself of him, I must; go, he shall. But how? You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive mortal,—you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty? No, I will not, I cannot do that. Rather would I let him live and die here, and then mason up his remains in the wall. What then will you do? For all your coaxing, he will not budge. Bribes he leaves under your own paperweight on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he prefers to cling to you.\n\nThen something severe, something unusual must be done. What! surely you will not have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent pallor to the common jail? And upon what ground could you procure such a thing to be done?—a vagrant, is he? What! he a vagrant, a wanderer, who refuses to budge? It is because he will not be a vagrant, then, that you seek to count him as a vagrant. That is too absurd. No visible means of support: there I have him. Wrong again: for indubitably he does support himself, and that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do. No more then. Since he will not quit me, I must quit him. I will change my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, that if I find him on my ne", "context_order": 3, "question": "How many days did the narrator initially give Quimby to leave the office?", "answer": "Six days."}

In a word, I propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no longer require your services. I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another place.”\n\nHe made no reply, and nothing more was said.\n\nOn the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers, and having but little furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be removed the last thing. It was withdrawn; and being folded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked room. I stood in the entry watching him a moment, while something from within me upbraided me.\n\nI re-entered, with my hand in my pocket—and—and my heart in my mouth.\n\n“Good-bye, Quimby; I am going—good-bye, and God some way bless you; and take that,” slipping something in his hand. But it dropped upon the floor, and then,—strange to say—I tore myself from him whom I had so longed to be rid of.\n\nEstablished in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked, and started at every footfall in the passages. When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key. But these fears were needless. Quimby never came nigh me.\n\nI thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited me, inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No.—Wall-street.\n\nFull of forebodings, I replied that I was.\n\n“Then sir,” said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, “you are responsible for the man you left there. He refuses to do any copying; he refuses to do any thing; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses to quit the premises.”\n\n“I am very sorry, sir,” said I, with assumed tranquility, but an inward tremor, “but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to me—he is no relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me responsible for him.”\n\n“In mercy’s name, who is he?”\n\n“I certainly cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. Formerly I employed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some time past.”\n\n“I shall settle him then,—good morning, sir.”\n\nSeveral days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt a charitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Quimby, yet a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me.\n\nAll is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through another week no further intelligence reached me. But coming to my room the day after, I found several persons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous excitement.\n\n“That’s the man—here he comes,” cried the foremost one, whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.\n\n“You must take him away, sir, at once,” cried a portly person among them, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of No.—Wall-street. “These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any longer; Mr. B—” pointing to the lawyer, “has turned him out of his room, and he now persists in haunting the building generally, sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by night. Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some fears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without delay.”\n\nAghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have locked myself in my new quarters. In vain I persisted that Quimby was nothing to me—no more than to any one else. In vain:—I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the terrible account. Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one person present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the lawyer’s) own room, I would that afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.\n\nGoing up stairs to my old haunt, there was Quimby silently sitting upon the banister at the landing.\n\n“What are you doing here, Quimby?” said I.\n\n“Sitting upon the banister,” he mildly replied.\n\nI motioned him into the lawyer’s room, who then left us.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, “are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something, or something must be done to you. Now what sort of business would you like to engage in? Would you like to re-engage in copying for some one?”\n\n“No; I would prefer not to make any change.”\n\n“Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?”\n\n“There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a clerkship; but I am not particular.”\n\n“Too much confinement,” I cried, “why you keep yourself confined all the time!”\n\n“I would prefer not to take a clerkship,” he rejoined, as if to settle that little item at once.\n\n“How would a bar-tender’s business suit you? There is no trying of the eyesight in that.”\n\n“I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not particular.”\n\nHis unwonted wordiness inspirited me. I returned to the charge.\n\n“Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting bills for the merchants? That would improve your health.”\n\n“No, I would prefer to be doing something else.”\n\n“How then would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young gentleman with your conversation,—how would that suit you?”\n\n“Not at all. It does not strike me that there is any thing definite about that. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular.”\n\n“Stationary you shall be then,” I cried, now losing all patience, and for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly flying into a passion. “If you do not go away from these premises before night, I shall feel bound—indeed I am bound—to—to—to quit the premises myself!” I rather absurdly concluded, knowing not with what possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance. Despairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him, when a final thought occurred to me—one which had not been wholly unindulged before.\n\n“Quimby,” said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, “will you go home with me now—not to my office, but my dwelling—and remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now, right away.”\n\n“No: at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.”\n\nI answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street towards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed from pursuit. As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Quimby, and shield him from rude persecution. I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have wished. So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surrendering my business to Hatcher, for a few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria. In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for the time.\n\nWhen again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon the desk. I opened it with trembling hands. It informed me that the writer had sent to the police, and had Quimby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant. Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he wished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the facts. These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me. At first I was indignant; but at last almost approved. The landlord’s energetic, summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not think I would have decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.\n\nAs I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be conducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.\n\nSome of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and headed by one of the constables arm in arm with Quimby, the silent procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon.\n\nThe same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or to speak more properly, the Halls of Justice. Seeking the right officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described was indeed within. I then assured the functionary that Quimby was a perfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however unaccountably eccentric. I narrated all I knew, and closed by suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as possible till something less harsh might be done—though indeed I hardly knew what. At all events, if nothing else could be decided upon, the alms-house must receive him. I then begged to have an interview.\n\nBeing under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and especially in the inclosed grass-platted yard thereof. And so I found him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.\n\n“Quimby!”\n\n“I know you,” he said, without looking round,—“and I want nothing to say to you.”\n\n“It was not I that brought you here, Quimby,” said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion. “And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it is not so sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and here is the grass.”\n\n“I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I left him.\n\nAs I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron, accosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said—“Is that your friend?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the prison fare, that’s all.”\n\n“Who are you?” asked I, not knowing what to make of such an unofficially speaking person in such a place.\n\n“I am the grub-man. Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to provide them with something good to eat.”\n\n“Is this so?” said I, turning to the turnkey.\n\nHe said it was.\n\n“Well then,” said I, slipping some silver into the grub-man’s hands (for so they called him). “I want you to give particular attention to my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can get. And you must be as polite to him as possible.”\n\n“Introduce me, will you?” said the grub-man, looking at me with an expression which seemed to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding.\n\nThinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and asking the grub-man his name, went up with him to Quimby.\n\n“Quimby, this is Chefson; you will find him very useful to you.”\n\n“Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant,” said the grub-man, making a low salutation behind his apron. “Hope you find it pleasant here, sir;—spacious grounds—cool apartments, sir—hope you’ll stay with us some time—try to make it agreeable. May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your company to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets’ private room?”\n\n“I prefer not to dine to-day,” said Quimby, turning away. “It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners.” So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.\n\n“How’s this?” said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare of astonishment. “He’s odd, aint he?”\n\n“I think he is a little deranged,” said I, sadly.\n\n“Deranged? deranged is it? Well now, upon my word, I thought that friend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale and genteel-like, them forgers. I can’t pity’em—can’t help it, sir. Did you know Calvin Rochester?” he added touchingly, and paused. Then, laying his hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, “he died of consumption at Sing-Sing. So you weren’t acquainted with Monroe?”\n\n“No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot stop longer. Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will see you again.”\n\nSome few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went through the corridors in quest of Quimby; but without finding him.\n\n“I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,” said a turnkey, “may be he’s gone to loiter in the yards.”\n\nSo I went in that direction.\n\n“Are you looking for the silent man?” said another turnkey passing me. “Yonder he lies—sleeping in the yard there. ’Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down.”\n\nThe yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all sounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.\n\nStrangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted Quimby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.\n\nThe round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. “His dinner is ready. Won’t he dine to-day, either? Or does he live without dining?”\n\n“Lives without dining,” said I, and closed his eyes.\n\n“Eh!—He’s asleep, aint he?”\n\n“With kings and counselors,” murmured I.\n\nThere would seem little need for proceeding further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Quimby’s interment. But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who Quimby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator’s making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear a few months after the scrivener’s decease. Upon what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The report was this: that Quimby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:—the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:—he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.\n\nAh Quimby!

There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will remember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake—a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from the “grand hotel” of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a hundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little Swiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden. One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous, even classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month of June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said, indeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither and thither of “stylish” young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces, a rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched voices at all times. You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the “Trois Couronnes” and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the “Trois Couronnes,” it must be added, there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of legation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon.\n\nI hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago, sat in the garden of the “Trois Couronnes,” looking about him, rather idly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned. It was a beautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things, they must have seemed to him charming. He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who was staying at the hotel—Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence. But his aunt had a headache—his aunt had almost always a headache—and now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that he was at liberty to wander about. He was some seven-and-twenty years of age; when his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at Geneva “studying.” When his enemies spoke of him, they said—but, after all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and universally liked. What I should say is, simply, that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there—a foreign lady—a person older than himself. Very few Americans—indeed, I think none—had ever seen this lady, about whom there were some singular stories. But Alexander had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there as a boy, and he had afterward gone to college there—circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships. Many of these he had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him.\n\nAfter knocking at his aunt’s door and learning that she was indisposed, he had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his breakfast. He had now finished his breakfast; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee, which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache. At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came walking along the path—an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was diminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale complexion, and sharp little features. He was dressed in knickerbockers, with red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks; he also wore a brilliant red cravat. He carried in his hand a long alpenstock, the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached—the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the ladies’ dresses. In front of Alexander he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes.\n\n“Will you give me a lump of sugar?” he asked in a sharp, hard little voice—a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.\n\nAlexander glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. “Yes, you may take one,” he answered; “but I don’t think sugar is good for little boys.”\n\nThis little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place. He poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Alexander’s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth.\n\n“Oh, blazes; it’s har-r-d!” he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner.\n\nAlexander had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman. “Take care you don’t hurt your teeth,” he said, paternally.\n\n“I haven’t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only got seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out right afterward. She said she’d slap me if any more came out. I can’t help it. It’s this old Europe. It’s the climate that makes them come out. In America they didn’t come out. It’s these hotels.”\n\nAlexander was much amused. “If you eat three lumps of sugar, your mother will certainly slap you,” he said.\n\n“She’s got to give me some candy, then,” rejoined his young interlocutor. “I can’t get any candy here—any American candy. American candy’s the best candy.”\n\n“And are American little boys the best little boys?” asked Alexander.\n\n“I don’t know. I’m an American boy,” said the child.\n\n“I see you are one of the best!” laughed Alexander.\n\n“Are you an American man?” pursued this vivacious infant. And then, on Alexander’s affirmative reply—“American men are the best,” he declared.\n\nHis companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar. Alexander wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at about this age.\n\n“Here comes my sister!” cried the child in a moment. “She’s an American girl.”\n\nAlexander looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing. “American girls are the best girls,” he said cheerfully to his young companion.\n\n“My sister ain’t the best!” the child declared. “She’s always blowing at me.”\n\n“I imagine that is your fault, not hers,” said Alexander. The young lady meanwhile had drawn near. She was dressed in white muslin, with a hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. “How pretty they are!” thought Alexander, straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise.\n\nThe young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the garden, which overlooked the lake. The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.\n\n“Lucas,” said the young lady, “what ARE you doing?”\n\n“I’m going up the Alps,” replied Lucas. “This is the way!” And he gave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Alexander’s ears.\n\n“That’s the way they come down,” said Alexander.\n\n“He’s an American man!” cried Lucas, in his little hard voice.\n\nThe young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother. “Well, I guess you had better be quiet,” she simply observed.\n\nIt seemed to Alexander that he had been in a manner presented. He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette. “This little boy and I have made acquaintance,” he said, with great civility. In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions could be better than these?—a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on hearing Alexander’s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains. He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat. While he was thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again.\n\n“I should like to know where you got that pole,” she said.\n\n“I bought it,” responded Lucas.\n\n“You don’t mean to say you’re going to take it to Italy?”\n\n“Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,” the child declared.\n\nThe young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. “Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,” she said after a moment.\n\n“Are you going to Italy?” Alexander inquired in a tone of great respect.\n\nThe young lady glanced at him again. “Yes, sir,” she replied. And she said nothing more.\n\n“Are you—a—going over the Simplon?” Alexander pursued, a little embarrassed.\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I suppose it’s some mountain. Lucas, what mountain are we going over?”\n\n“Going where?” the child demanded.\n\n“To Italy,” Alexander explained.\n\n“I don’t know,” said Lucas. “I don’t want to go to Italy. I want to go to America.”\n\n“Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!” rejoined the young man.\n\n“Can you get candy there?” Lucas loudly inquired.\n\n“I hope not,” said his sister. “I guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too.”\n\n“I haven’t had any for ever so long—for a hundred weeks!” cried the boy, still jumping about.\n\nThe young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and Alexander presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view. He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered. If she looked another way when he spoke to her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her habit, her manner. Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite unacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking. It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance, for the young girl’s eyes were singularly honest and fresh. They were wonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Alexander had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman’s various features—her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth. He had a great relish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it; and as regards this young lady’s face he made several observations. It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and though it was eminently delicate, Alexander mentally accused it—very forgivingly—of a want of finish. He thought it very possible that Master Lucas’s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of her own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was no mockery, no irony. Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation. She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter—she and her mother and Lucas. She asked him if he was a “real American”; she shouldn’t have taken him for one; he seemed more like a German—this was said after a little hesitation—especially when he spoke. Alexander, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a German. Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted. She answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she presently sat down. She told him she was from New York State—“if you know where that is.” Alexander learned more about her by catching hold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side.\n\n“Tell me your name, my boy,” he said.\n\n“Lucas,” said the boy sharply. “And I’ll tell you her name;” and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.\n\n“You had better wait till you are asked!” said this young lady calmly.\n\n“I should like very much to know your name,” said Alexander.\n\n“Her name is Violet!” cried the child. “But that isn’t her real name; that isn’t her name on her cards.”\n\n“It’s a pity you haven’t got one of my cards!” said Violet.\n\n“Her real name is Violet,” the boy went on.\n\n“Ask him HIS name,” said his sister, indicating Alexander.\n\nBut on this point Lucas seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family. “My father’s name is Marcus,” he announced. “My father ain’t in Europe; my father’s in a better place than Europe.”\n\nAlexander imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward. But Lucas immediately added, “My father’s in Schenectady. He’s got a big business. My father’s rich, you bet!”\n\n“Well!” ejaculated Violet, lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border. Alexander presently released the child, who departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. “He doesn’t like Europe,” said the young girl. “He wants to go back.”\n\n“To Schenectady, you mean?”\n\n“Yes; he wants to go right home. He hasn’t got any boys here. There is one boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won’t let him play.”\n\n“And your brother hasn’t any teacher?” Alexander inquired.\n\n“Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. There was a lady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady—perhaps you know her—Mrs. Andrews. I think she came from Boston. She told her of this teacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But Lucas said he didn’t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said he wouldn’t have lessons when he was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars about half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars—I think her name was Miss Hawthorne; perhaps you know her. She wanted to know why I didn’t give Lucas lessons—give him ‘instruction,’ she called it. I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him. He’s very smart.”\n\n“Yes,” said Alexander; “he seems very smart.”\n\n“Mother’s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy. Can you get good teachers in Italy?”\n\n“Very good, I should think,” said Alexander.\n\n“Or else she’s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more. He’s only nine. He’s going to college.” And in this way Violet continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics. She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with very brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of Alexander, now wandering over the garden, the people who passed by, and the beautiful view. She talked to Alexander as if she had known him a long time. He found it very pleasant. It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have been said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench, that she chattered. She was very quiet; she sat in a charming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving. She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was decidedly sociable. She gave Alexander a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and enumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped. “That English lady in the cars,” she said—“Miss Hawthorne—asked me if we didn’t all live in hotels in America. I told her I had never been in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never seen so many—it’s nothing but hotels.” But Violet did not make this remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best humor with everything. She declared that the hotels were very good, when once you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet. She was not disappointed—not a bit. Perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before. She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times. And then she had had ever so many dresses and things from Paris. Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in Europe.\n\n“It was a kind of a wishing cap,” said Alexander.\n\n“Yes,” said Violet without examining this analogy; “it always made me wish I was here. But I needn’t have done that for dresses. I am sure they send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful things here. The only thing I don’t like,” she proceeded, “is the society. There isn’t any society; or, if there is, I don’t know where it keeps itself. Do you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I haven’t seen anything of it. I’m very fond of society, and I have always had a great deal of it. I don’t mean only in Schenectady, but in New York. I used to go to New York every winter. In New York I had lots of society. Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them were by gentlemen,” added Violet. “I have more friends in New York than in Schenectady—more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends too,” she resumed in a moment. She paused again for an instant; she was looking at Alexander with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light, slightly monotonous smile. “I have always had,” she said, “a great deal of gentlemen’s society.”\n\nPoor Alexander was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion; never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. And yet was he to accuse Violet of actual or potential inconduite, as they said at Geneva? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone. Never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this. Certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State? Were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen’s society? Or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? Alexander had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. Violet looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him that, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told him that, after all, they were not. He was inclined to think Violet was a flirt—a pretty American flirt. He had never, as yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. He had known, here in Europe, two or three women—persons older than Violet, and provided, for respectability’s sake, with husbands—who were great coquettes—dangerous, terrible women, with whom one’s relations were liable to take a serious turn. But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty American flirt. Alexander was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to Violet. He leaned back in his seat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one’s intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn.\n\n“Have you been to that old castle?” asked the young girl, pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon.\n\n“Yes, formerly, more than once,” said Alexander. “You too, I suppose, have seen it?”\n\n“No; we haven’t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I mean to go there. I wouldn’t go away from here without having seen that old castle.”\n\n“It’s a very pretty excursion,” said Alexander, “and very easy to make. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.”\n\n“You can go in the cars,” said Violet.\n\n“Yes; you can go in the cars,” Alexander assented.\n\n“Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,” the young girl continued. “We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn’t go. Lucas wouldn’t go either; he says he doesn’t think much of old castles. But I guess we’ll go this week, if we can get Lucas.”\n\n“Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?” Alexander inquired, smiling.\n\n“He says he don’t care much about old castles. He’s only nine. He wants to stay at the hotel. Mother’s afraid to leave him alone, and the courier won’t stay with him; so we haven’t been to many places. But it will be too bad if we don’t go up there.” And Violet pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon.\n\n“I should think it might be arranged,” said Alexander. “Couldn’t you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Lucas?”\n\nViolet looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, “I wish YOU would stay with him!” she said.\n\nAlexander hesitated a moment. “I should much rather go to Chillon with you.”\n\n“With me?” asked the young girl with the same placidity.\n\nShe didn’t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done; and yet Alexander, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it possible she was offended. “With your mother,” he answered very respectfully.\n\nBut it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Violet. “I guess my mother won’t go, after all,” she said. “She don’t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what you said just now—that you would like to go up there?”\n\n“Most earnestly,” Alexander declared.\n\n“Then we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Lucas, I guess Antonio will.”\n\n“Antonio?” the young man inquired.\n\n“Antonio’s our courier. He doesn’t like to stay with Lucas; he’s the most fastidious man I ever saw. But he’s a splendid courier. I guess he’ll stay at home with Lucas if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.”\n\nAlexander reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible—“we” could only mean Violet and himself. This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady’s hand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably Antonio, appeared. A tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached Violet, looking sharply at her companion. “Oh, Antonio!” said Violet with the friendliest accent.\n\nAntonio had looked at Alexander from head to foot; he now bowed gravely to the young lady. “I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table.”\n\nViolet slowly rose. “See here, Antonio!” she said; “I’m going to that old castle, anyway.”\n\n“To the Chateau de Chillon, mademoiselle?” the courier inquired. “Mademoiselle has made arrangements?” he added in a tone which struck Alexander as very impertinent.\n\nAntonio’s tone apparently threw, even to Violet’s own apprehension, a slightly ironical light upon the young girl’s situation. She ", "context_order": 0, "question": "What excuse does Alexander's aunt give for being unavailable when he arrives at the hotel?", "answer": "She has a headache."}

The young man, at least, thought his manner of looking an offense to Violet; it conveyed an imputation that she “picked up” acquaintances. “I shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,” he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.\n\n“Oh, well, we’ll go some day,” said Violet. And she gave him a smile and turned away. She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside Antonio. Alexander stood looking after her; and as she moved away, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess.\n\nHe had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to present his aunt, Mrs. Fitzgerald, to Violet. As soon as the former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family—a mamma, a daughter, and a little boy.\n\n“And a courier?” said Mrs. Fitzgerald. “Oh yes, I have observed them. Seen them—heard them—and kept out of their way.” Mrs. Fitzgerald was a widow with a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently intimated that, if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches, she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time. She had a long, pale face, a high nose, and a great deal of very striking white hair, which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head. She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe. This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg, and, though he was on his travels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there. Her nephew, who had come up to Vevey expressly to see her, was therefore more attentive than those who, as she said, were nearer to her. He had imbibed at Geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to one’s aunt. Mrs. Fitzgerald had not seen him for many years, and she was greatly pleased with him, manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the American capital. She admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he were acquainted with New York, he would see that one had to be. And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to Alexander’s imagination, almost oppressively striking.\n\nHe immediately perceived, from her tone, that Violet’s place in the social scale was low. “I am afraid you don’t approve of them,” he said.\n\n“They are very common,” Mrs. Fitzgerald declared. “They are the sort of Americans that one does one’s duty by not—not accepting.”\n\n“Ah, you don’t accept them?” said the young man.\n\n“I can’t, my dear Nathan. I would if I could, but I can’t.”\n\n“The young girl is very pretty,” said Alexander in a moment.\n\n“Of course she’s pretty. But she is very common.”\n\n“I see what you mean, of course,” said Alexander after another pause.\n\n“She has that charming look that they all have,” his aunt resumed. “I can’t think where they pick it up; and she dresses in perfection—no, you don’t know how well she dresses. I can’t think where they get their taste.”\n\n“But, my dear aunt, she is not, after all, a Comanche savage.”\n\n“She is a young lady,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald, “who has an intimacy with her mamma’s courier.”\n\n“An intimacy with the courier?” the young man demanded.\n\n“Oh, the mother is just as bad! They treat the courier like a familiar friend—like a gentleman. I shouldn’t wonder if he dines with them. Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such fine clothes, so like a gentleman. He probably corresponds to the young lady’s idea of a count. He sits with them in the garden in the evening. I think he smokes.”\n\nAlexander listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped him to make up his mind about Violet. Evidently she was rather wild. “Well,” he said, “I am not a courier, and yet she was very charming to me.”\n\n“You had better have said at first,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald with dignity, “that you had made her acquaintance.”\n\n“We simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit.”\n\n“Tout bonnement! And pray what did you say?”\n\n“I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt.”\n\n“I am much obliged to you.”\n\n“It was to guarantee my respectability,” said Alexander.\n\n“And pray who is to guarantee hers?”\n\n“Ah, you are cruel!” said the young man. “She’s a very nice young girl.”\n\n“You don’t say that as if you believed it,” Mrs. Fitzgerald observed.\n\n“She is completely uncultivated,” Alexander went on. “But she is wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. To prove that I believe it, I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon.”\n\n“You two are going off there together? I should say it proved just the contrary. How long had you known her, may I ask, when this interesting project was formed? You haven’t been twenty-four hours in the house.”\n\n“I have known her half an hour!” said Alexander, smiling.\n\n“Dear me!” cried Mrs. Fitzgerald. “What a dreadful girl!”\n\nHer nephew was silent for some moments. “You really think, then,” he began earnestly, and with a desire for trustworthy information—“you really think that—” But he paused again.\n\n“Think what, sir?” said his aunt.\n\n“That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later, to carry her off?”\n\n“I haven’t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. But I really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls that are uncultivated, as you call them. You have lived too long out of the country. You will be sure to make some great mistake. You are too innocent.”\n\n“My dear aunt, I am not so innocent,” said Alexander, smiling and curling his mustache.\n\n“You are guilty too, then!”\n\nAlexander continued to curl his mustache meditatively. “You won’t let the poor girl know you then?” he asked at last.\n\n“Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with you?”\n\n“I think that she fully intends it.”\n\n“Then, my dear Nathan,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald, “I must decline the honor of her acquaintance. I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank Heaven, to be shocked!”\n\n“But don’t they all do these things—the young girls in America?” Alexander inquired.\n\nMrs. Fitzgerald stared a moment. “I should like to see my granddaughters do them!” she declared grimly.\n\nThis seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Alexander remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were “tremendous flirts.” If, therefore, Violet exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that anything might be expected of her. Alexander was impatient to see her again, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not appreciate her justly.\n\nThough he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunt’s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he discovered, promptly enough, that with Violet there was no great need of walking on tiptoe. He found her that evening in the garden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph, and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld. It was ten o’clock. He had dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since dinner, and had just taken leave of her till the morrow. Violet seemed very glad to see him; she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed.\n\n“Have you been all alone?” he asked.\n\n“I have been walking round with mother. But mother gets tired walking round,” she answered.\n\n“Has she gone to bed?”\n\n“No; she doesn’t like to go to bed,” said the young girl. “She doesn’t sleep—not three hours. She says she doesn’t know how she lives. She’s dreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She’s gone somewhere after Lucas; she wants to try to get him to go to bed. He doesn’t like to go to bed.”\n\n“Let us hope she will persuade him,” observed Alexander.\n\n“She will talk to him all she can; but he doesn’t like her to talk to him,” said Violet, opening her fan. “She’s going to try to get Antonio to talk to him. But he isn’t afraid of Antonio. Antonio’s a splendid courier, but he can’t make much impression on Lucas! I don’t believe he’ll go to bed before eleven.” It appeared that Lucas’s vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Alexander strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother. “I have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,” his companion resumed. “She’s your aunt.” Then, on Alexander’s admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she said she had heard all about Mrs. Fitzgerald from the chambermaid. She was very quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no one, and she never dined at the table d’hote. Every two days she had a headache. “I think that’s a lovely description, headache and all!” said Violet, chattering along in her thin, gay voice. “I want to know her ever so much. I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like her. She would be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I’m dying to be exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I. We don’t speak to everyone—or they don’t speak to us. I suppose it’s about the same thing. Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.”\n\nAlexander was embarrassed. “She would be most happy,” he said; “but I am afraid those headaches will interfere.”\n\nThe young girl looked at him through the dusk. “But I suppose she doesn’t have a headache every day,” she said sympathetically.\n\nAlexander was silent a moment. “She tells me she does,” he answered at last, not knowing what to say.\n\nViolet stopped and stood looking at him. Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous fan. “She doesn’t want to know me!” she said suddenly. “Why don’t you say so? You needn’t be afraid. I’m not afraid!” And she gave a little laugh.\n\nAlexander fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it. “My dear young lady,” he protested, “she knows no one. It’s her wretched health.”\n\nThe young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. “You needn’t be afraid,” she repeated. “Why should she want to know me?” Then she paused again; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her was the starlit lake. There was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms. Violet looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. “Gracious! she IS exclusive!” she said. Alexander wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes. He felt then, for the instant, quite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit that she was a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they needn’t mind her. But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an exclamation in quite another tone. “Well, here’s Mother! I guess she hasn’t got Lucas to go to bed.” The figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause.\n\n“Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?” Alexander asked.\n\n“Well!” cried Violet with a laugh; “I guess I know my own mother. And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my things.”\n\nThe lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps.\n\n“I am afraid your mother doesn’t see you,” said Alexander. “Or perhaps,” he added, thinking, with Violet, the joke permissible—“perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.”\n\n“Oh, it’s a fearful old thing!” the young girl replied serenely. “I told her she could wear it. She won’t come here because she sees you.”\n\n“Ah, then,” said Alexander, “I had better leave you.”\n\n“Oh, no; come on!” urged Violet.\n\n“I’m afraid your mother doesn’t approve of my walking with you.”\n\nViolet gave him a serious glance. “It isn’t for me; it’s for you—that is, it’s for HER. Well, I don’t know who it’s for! But mother doesn’t like any of my gentlemen friends. She’s right down timid. She always makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman. But I DO introduce them—almost always. If I didn’t introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother,” the young girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, “I shouldn’t think I was natural.”\n\n“To introduce me,” said Alexander, “you must know my name.” And he proceeded to pronounce it.\n\n“Oh, dear, I can’t say all that!” said his companion with a laugh. But by this time they had come up to Mrs. Clark, who, as they drew near, walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them. “Mother!” said the young girl in a tone of decision. Upon this the elder lady turned round. “Mr. Alexander,” said Violet, introducing the young man very frankly and prettily. “Common,” she was, as Mrs. Fitzgerald had pronounced her; yet it was a wonder to Alexander that, with her commonness, she had a singularly delicate grace.\n\nHer mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of thin, much frizzled hair. Like her daughter, Mrs. Clark was dressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. So far as Alexander could observe, she gave him no greeting—she certainly was not looking at him. Violet was near her, pulling her shawl straight. “What are you doing, poking round here?” this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply.\n\n“I don’t know,” said her mother, turning toward the lake again.\n\n“I shouldn’t think you’d want that shawl!” Violet exclaimed.\n\n“Well I do!” her mother answered with a little laugh.\n\n“Did you get Lucas to go to bed?” asked the young girl.\n\n“No; I couldn’t induce him,” said Mrs. Clark very gently. “He wants to talk to the waiter. He likes to talk to that waiter.”\n\n“I was telling Mr. Alexander,” the young girl went on; and to the young man’s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life.\n\n“Oh, yes!” said Alexander; “I have the pleasure of knowing your son.”\n\nLucas’s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. But at last she spoke. “Well, I don’t see how he lives!”\n\n“Anyhow, it isn’t so bad as it was at Dover,” said Violet.\n\n“And what occurred at Dover?” Alexander asked.\n\n“He wouldn’t go to bed at all. I guess he sat up all night in the public parlor. He wasn’t in bed at twelve o’clock: I know that.”\n\n“It was half-past twelve,” declared Mrs. Clark with mild emphasis.\n\n“Does he sleep much during the day?” Alexander demanded.\n\n“I guess he doesn’t sleep much,” Violet rejoined.\n\n“I wish he would!” said her mother. “It seems as if he couldn’t.”\n\n“I think he’s real tiresome,” Violet pursued.\n\nThen, for some moments, there was silence. “Well, Violet,” said the elder lady, presently, “I shouldn’t think you’d want to talk against your own brother!”\n\n“Well, he IS tiresome, Mother,” said Violet, quite without the asperity of a retort.\n\n“He’s only nine,” urged Mrs. Clark.\n\n“Well, he wouldn’t go to that castle,” said the young girl. “I’m going there with Mr. Alexander.”\n\nTo this announcement, very placidly made, Violet’s mamma offered no response. Alexander took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple, easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure. “Yes,” he began; “your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide.”\n\nMrs. Clark’s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of appealing air, to Violet, who, however, strolled a few steps farther, gently humming to herself. “I presume you will go in the cars,” said her mother.\n\n“Yes, or in the boat,” said Alexander.\n\n“Well, of course, I don’t know,” Mrs. Clark rejoined. “I have never been to that castle.”\n\n“It is a pity you shouldn’t go,” said Alexander, beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.\n\n“We’ve been thinking ever so much about going,” she pursued; “but it seems as if we couldn’t. Of course Violet—she wants to go round. But there’s a lady here—I don’t know her name—she says she shouldn’t think we’d want to go to see castles HERE; she should think we’d want to wait till we got to Italy. It seems as if there would be so many there,” continued Mrs. Clark with an air of increasing confidence. “Of course we only want to see the principal ones. We visited several in England,” she presently added.\n\n“Ah yes! in England there are beautiful castles,” said Alexander. “But Chillon here, is very well worth seeing.”\n\n“Well, if Violet feels up to it—” said Mrs. Clark, in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. “It seems as if there was nothing she wouldn’t undertake.”\n\n“Oh, I think she’ll enjoy it!” Alexander declared. And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of them, softly vocalizing. “You are not disposed, madam,” he inquired, “to undertake it yourself?”\n\nViolet’s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward in silence. Then—“I guess she had better go alone,” she said simply. Alexander observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake. But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by Mrs. Clark’s unprotected daughter.\n\n“Mr. Alexander!” murmured Violet.\n\n“Mademoiselle!” said the young man.\n\n“Don’t you want to take me out in a boat?”\n\n“At present?” he asked.\n\n“Of course!” said Violet.\n\n“Well, Violet!” exclaimed her mother.\n\n“I beg you, madam, to let her go,” said Alexander ardently; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.\n\n“I shouldn’t think she’d want to,” said her mother. “I should think she’d rather go indoors.”\n\n“I’m sure Mr. Alexander wants to take me,” Violet declared. “He’s so awfully devoted!”\n\n“I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight.”\n\n“I don’t believe it!” said Violet.\n\n“Well!” ejaculated the elder lady again.\n\n“You haven’t spoken to me for half an hour,” her daughter went on.\n\n“I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,” said Alexander.\n\n“Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!” Violet repeated. They had all stopped, and she had turned round and was looking at Alexander. Her face wore a charming smile, her pretty eyes were gleaming, she was swinging her great fan about. No; it’s impossible to be prettier than that, thought Alexander.\n\n“There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,” he said, pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake. “If you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one of them.”\n\nViolet stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little, light laugh. “I like a gentleman to be formal!” she declared.\n\n“I assure you it’s a formal offer.”\n\n“I was bound I would make you say something,” Violet went on.\n\n“You see, it’s not very difficult,” said Alexander. “But I am afraid you are chaffing me.”\n\n“I think not, sir,” remarked Mrs. Clark very gently.\n\n“Do, then, let me give you a row,” he said to the young girl.\n\n“It’s quite lovely, the way you say that!” cried Violet.\n\n“It will be still more lovely to do it.”\n\n“Yes, it would be lovely!” said Violet. But she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing.\n\n“I should think you had better find out what time it is,” interposed her mother.\n\n“It is eleven o’clock, madam,” said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of the neighboring darkness; and Alexander, turning, perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He had apparently just approached.\n\n“Oh, Antonio,” said Violet, “I am going out in a boat!”\n\nAntonio bowed. “At eleven o’clock, mademoiselle?”\n\n“I am going with Mr. Alexander—this very minute.”\n\n“Do tell her she can’t,” said Mrs. Clark to the courier.\n\n“I think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,” Antonio declared.\n\nAlexander wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier; but he said nothing.\n\n“I suppose you don’t think it’s proper!” Violet exclaimed. “Antonio doesn’t think anything’s proper.”\n\n“I am at your service,” said Alexander.\n\n“Does mademoiselle propose to go alone?” asked Antonio of Mrs. Clark.\n\n“Oh, no; with this gentleman!” answered Violet’s mamma.\n\nThe courier looked for a moment at Alexander—the latter thought he was smiling—and then, solemnly, with a bow, “As mademoiselle pleases!” he said.\n\n“Oh, I hoped you would make a fuss!” said Violet. “I don’t care to go now.”\n\n“I myself shall make a fuss if you don’t go,” said Alexander.\n\n“That’s all I want—a little fuss!” And the young girl began to laugh again.\n\n“Lucas has gone to bed!” the courier announced frigidly.\n\n“Oh, Violet; now we can go!” said Mrs. Clark.\n\nViolet turned away from Alexander, looking at him, smiling and fanning herself. “Good night,” she said; “I hope you are disappointed, or disgusted, or something!”\n\nHe looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. “I am puzzled,” he answered.\n\n“Well, I hope it won’t keep you awake!” she said very smartly; and, under the escort of the privileged Antonio, the two ladies passed toward the house.\n\nAlexander stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. He lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the mystery of the young girl’s sudden familiarities and caprices. But the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly “going off” with her somewhere.\n\nTwo days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon. He waited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the servants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring. It was not the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it. She came tripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume. Alexander was a man of imagination and, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her dress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he felt as if there were something romantic going forward. He could have believed he was going to elope with her. He passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking at her very hard; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him. Alexander’s preference had been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats. There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such lots of people. The sail was not long, but Alexander’s companion found time to say a great many things.

{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Daisy Miller.txt", "context": "heir little excursion was so much of an escapade—an adventure—that, even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way. But it must be confessed that, in this particular, he was disappointed. Violet was extremely animated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all excited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her. People continued to look at her a great deal, and Alexander took much satisfaction in his pretty companion’s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about the boat a good deal. But he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling, with his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections. It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard. He had assented to the idea that she was “common”; but was she so, after all, or was he simply getting used to her commonness? Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a subjective turn.\n\n“What on EARTH are you so grave about?” she suddenly demanded, fixing her agreeable eyes upon Alexander’s.\n\n“Am I grave?” he asked. “I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear.”\n\n“You look as if you were taking me to a funeral. If that’s a grin, your ears are very near together.”\n\n“Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?”\n\n“Pray do, and I’ll carry round your hat. It will pay the expenses of our journey.”\n\n“I never was better pleased in my life,” murmured Alexander.\n\nShe looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh. “I like to make you say those things! You’re a queer mixture!”\n\nIn the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly prevailed. Violet tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly well-shaped ear to everything that Alexander told her about the place. But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her. They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and Alexander arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried—that they should linger and pause wherever they chose. The custodian interpreted the bargain generously—Alexander, on his side, had been generous—and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. Violet’s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext. She found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Alexander sudden questions about himself—his family, his previous history, his tastes, his habits, his intentions—and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality. Of her own tastes, habits, and intentions Violet was prepared to give the most definite, and indeed the most favorable account.\n\n“Well, I hope you know enough!” she said to her companion, after he had told her the history of the unhappy Bonivard. “I never saw a man that knew so much!” The history of Bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone into one ear and out of the other. But Violet went on to say that she wished Alexander would travel with them and “go round” with them; they might know something, in that case. “Don’t you want to come and teach Lucas?” she asked. Alexander said that nothing could possibly please him so much, but that he had unfortunately other occupations. “Other occupations? I don’t believe it!” said Violet. “What do you mean? You are not in business.” The young man admitted that he was not in business; but he had engagements which, even within a day or two, would force him to go back to Geneva. “Oh, bother!” she said; “I don’t believe it!” and she began to talk about something else. But a few moments later, when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace, she broke out irrelevantly, “You don’t mean to say you are going back to Geneva?”\n\n“It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow.”\n\n“Well, Mr. Alexander,” said Violet, “I think you’re horrid!”\n\n“Oh, don’t say such dreadful things!” said Alexander—“just at the last!”\n\n“The last!” cried the young girl; “I call it the first. I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.” And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. Poor Alexander was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements. His companion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see. How did Violet know that there was a charmer in Geneva? Alexander, who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage. She seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. “Does she never allow you more than three days at a time?” asked Violet ironically. “Doesn’t she give you a vacation in summer? There’s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season. I suppose, if you stay another day, she’ll come after you in the boat. Do wait over till Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!” Alexander began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he had missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance. It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop “teasing” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter.\n\n“That’s not a difficult promise to make,” said Alexander. “My aunt has taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her.”\n\n“I don’t want you to come for your aunt,” said Violet; “I want you to come for me.” And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. He declared that, at any rate, he would certainly come. After this Violet stopped teasing. Alexander took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.\n\nIn the evening Alexander mentioned to Mrs. Fitzgerald that he had spent the afternoon at Chillon with Violet.\n\n“The Americans—of the courier?” asked this lady.\n\n“Ah, happily,” said Alexander, “the courier stayed at home.”\n\n“She went with you all alone?”\n\n“All alone.”\n\nMrs. Fitzgerald sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. “And that,” she exclaimed, “is the young person whom you wanted me to know!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II\nAlexander, who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion to Chillon, went to Rome toward the end of January. His aunt had been established there for several weeks, and he had received a couple of letters from her. “Those people you were so devoted to last summer at Vevey have turned up here, courier and all,” she wrote. “They seem to have made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the most intime. The young lady, however, is also very intimate with some third-rate Italians, with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk. Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez’s—Paule Mere—and don’t come later than the 23rd.”\n\nIn the natural course of events, Alexander, on arriving in Rome, would presently have ascertained Mrs. Clark’s address at the American banker’s and have gone to pay his compliments to Violet. “After what happened at Vevey, I think I may certainly call upon them,” he said to Mrs. Fitzgerald.\n\n“If, after what happens—at Vevey and everywhere—you desire to keep up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. Of course a man may know everyone. Men are welcome to the privilege!”\n\n“Pray what is it that happens—here, for instance?” Alexander demanded.\n\n“The girl goes about alone with her foreigners. As to what happens further, you must apply elsewhere for information. She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she takes them about to people’s houses. When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.”\n\n“And where is the mother?”\n\n“I haven’t the least idea. They are very dreadful people.”\n\nAlexander meditated a moment. “They are very ignorant—very innocent only. Depend upon it they are not bad.”\n\n“They are hopelessly vulgar,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald. “Whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being ‘bad’ is a question for the metaphysicians. They are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that is quite enough.”\n\nThe news that Violet was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked Alexander’s impulse to go straightway to see her. He had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when Mr. Alexander would arrive. If, however, he determined to wait a little before reminding Violet of his claims to her consideration, he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. One of these friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva, where she had placed her children at school. She was a very accomplished woman, and she lived in the Via Gregoriana. Alexander found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with southern sunshine. He had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in, announcing “Madame Mila!” This announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little Lucas, who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at Alexander. An instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable interval, Mrs. Clark slowly advanced.\n\n“I know you!” said Lucas.\n\n“I’m sure you know a great many things,” exclaimed Alexander, taking him by the hand. “How is your education coming on?”\n\nViolet was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when she heard Alexander’s voice she quickly turned her head. “Well, I declare!” she said.\n\n“I told you I should come, you know,” Alexander rejoined, smiling.\n\n“Well, I didn’t believe it,” said Violet.\n\n“I am much obliged to you,” laughed the young man.\n\n“You might have come to see me!” said Violet.\n\n“I arrived only yesterday.”\n\n“I don’t believe that!” the young girl declared.\n\nAlexander turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son. “We’ve got a bigger place than this,” said Lucas. “It’s all gold on the walls.”\n\nMrs. Clark turned uneasily in her chair. “I told you if I were to bring you, you would say something!” she murmured.\n\n“I told YOU!” Lucas exclaimed. “I tell YOU, sir!” he added jocosely, giving Alexander a thump on the knee. “It IS bigger, too!”\n\nViolet had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess; Alexander judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. “I hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey,” he said.\n\nMrs. Clark now certainly looked at him—at his chin. “Not very well, sir,” she answered.\n\n“She’s got the dyspepsia,” said Lucas. “I’ve got it too. Father’s got it. I’ve got it most!”\n\nThis announcement, instead of embarrassing Mrs. Clark, seemed to relieve her. “I suffer from the liver,” she said. “I think it’s this climate; it’s less bracing than Schenectady, especially in the winter season. I don’t know whether you know we reside at Schenectady. I was saying to Violet that I certainly hadn’t found any one like Dr. Bennett, and I didn’t believe I should. Oh, at Schenectady he stands first; they think everything of him. He has so much to do, and yet there was nothing he wouldn’t do for me. He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia, but he was bound to cure it. I’m sure there was nothing he wouldn’t try. He was just going to try something new when we came off. Mr. Miller wanted Violet to see Europe for herself. But I wrote to Mr. Miller that it seems as if I couldn’t get on without Dr. Bennett. At Schenectady he stands at the very top; and there’s a great deal of sickness there, too. It affects my sleep.”\n\nAlexander had a good deal of pathological gossip with Dr. Bennett’s patient, during which Violet chattered unremittingly to her own companion. The young man asked Mrs. Clark how she was pleased with Rome. “Well, I must say I am disappointed,” she answered. “We had heard so much about it; I suppose we had heard too much. But we couldn’t help that. We had been led to expect something different.”\n\n“Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,” said Alexander.\n\n“I hate it worse and worse every day!” cried Lucas.\n\n“You are like the infant Hannibal,” said Alexander.\n\n“No, I ain’t!” Lucas declared at a venture.\n\n“You are not much like an infant,” said his mother. “But we have seen places,” she resumed, “that I should put a long way before Rome.” And in reply to Alexander’s interrogation, “There’s Zurich,” she concluded, “I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn’t heard half so much about it.”\n\n“The best place we’ve seen is the City of Richmond!” said Lucas.\n\n“He means the ship,” his mother explained. “We crossed in that ship. Lucas had a good time on the City of Richmond.”\n\n“It’s the best place I’ve seen,” the child repeated. “Only it was turned the wrong way.”\n\n“Well, we’ve got to turn the right way some time,” said Mrs. Clark with a little laugh. Alexander expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in Rome, and she declared that Violet was quite carried away. “It’s on account of the society—the society’s splendid. She goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of acquaintances. Of course she goes round more than I do. I must say they have been very sociable; they have taken her right in. And then she knows a great many gentlemen. Oh, she thinks there’s nothing like Rome. Of course, it’s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen.”\n\nBy this time Violet had turned her attention again to Alexander. “I’ve been telling Mrs. Parker how mean you were!” the young girl announced.\n\n“And what is the evidence you have offered?” asked Alexander, rather annoyed at Violet’s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at Florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. He remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American women—the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom—were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness.\n\n“Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey,” said Violet. “You wouldn’t do anything. You wouldn’t stay there when I asked you.”\n\n“My dearest young lady,” cried Alexander, with eloquence, “have I come all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?”\n\n“Just hear him say that!” said Violet to her hostess, giving a twist to a bow on this lady’s dress. “Did you ever hear anything so quaint?”\n\n“So quaint, my dear?” murmured Mrs. Parker in the tone of a partisan of Alexander.\n\n“Well, I don’t know,” said Violet, fingering Mrs. Parker’s ribbons. “Mrs. Parker, I want to tell you something.”\n\n“Mother-r,” interposed Lucas, with his rough ends to his words, “I tell you you’ve got to go. Antonio’ll raise—something!”\n\n“I’m not afraid of Antonio,” said Violet with a toss of her head. “Look here, Mrs. Parker,” she went on, “you know I’m coming to your party.”\n\n“I am delighted to hear it.”\n\n“I’ve got a lovely dress!”\n\n“I am very sure of that.”\n\n“But I want to ask a favor—permission to bring a friend.”\n\n“I shall be happy to see any of your friends,” said Mrs. Parker, turning with a smile to Mrs. Clark.\n\n“Oh, they are not my friends,” answered Violet’s mamma, smiling shyly in her own fashion. “I never spoke to them.”\n\n“It’s an intimate friend of mine—Mr. Romano,” said Violet without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face.\n\nMrs. Parker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at Alexander. “I shall be glad to see Mr. Romano,” she then said.\n\n“He’s an Italian,” Violet pursued with the prettiest serenity. “He’s a great friend of mine; he’s the handsomest man in the world—except Mr. Alexander! He knows plenty of Italians, but he wants to know some Americans. He thinks ever so much of Americans. He’s tremendously clever. He’s perfectly lovely!”\n\nIt was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs. Parker’s party, and then Mrs. Clark prepared to take her leave. “I guess we’ll go back to the hotel,” she said.\n\n“You may go back to the hotel, Mother, but I’m going to take a walk,” said Violet.\n\n“She’s going to walk with Mr. Romano,” Lucas proclaimed.\n\n“I am going to the Pincio,” said Violet, smiling.\n\n“Alone, my dear—at this hour?” Mrs. Parker asked. The afternoon was drawing to a close—it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians. “I don’t think it’s safe, my dear,” said Mrs. Parker.\n\n“Neither do I,” subjoined Mrs. Clark. “You’ll get the fever, as sure as you live. Remember what Dr. Bennett told you!”\n\n“Give her some medicine before she goes,” said Lucas.\n\nThe company had risen to its feet; Violet, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. “Mrs. Parker, you are too perfect,” she said. “I’m not going alone; I am going to meet a friend.”\n\n“Your friend won’t keep you from getting the fever,” Mrs. Clark observed.\n\n“Is it Mr. Romano?” asked the hostess.\n\nAlexander was watching the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she glanced at Alexander. Then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, “Mr. Romano—the beautiful Romano.”\n\n“My dear young friend,” said Mrs. Parker, taking her hand pleadingly, “don’t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian.”\n\n“Well, he speaks English,” said Mrs. Clark.\n\n“Gracious me!” Violet exclaimed, “I don’t to do anything improper. There’s an easy way to settle it.” She continued to glance at Alexander. “The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr. Alexander were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with me!”\n\nAlexander’s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her. They passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door Alexander perceived Mrs. Clark’s carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within. “Goodbye, Antonio!” cried Violet; “I’m going to take a walk.” The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed. As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found their progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to Alexander, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in Violet’s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. His own mission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands of Mr. Romano; but Alexander, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no such thing.\n\n“Why haven’t you been to see me?” asked Violet. “You can’t get out of that.”\n\n“I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train.”\n\n“You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!” cried the young girl with her little laugh. “I suppose you were asleep. You have had time to go to see Mrs. Parker.”\n\n“I knew Mrs. Parker—” Alexander began to explain.\n\n“I know where you knew her. You knew her at Geneva. She told me so. Well, you knew me at Vevey. That’s just as good. So you ought to have come.” She asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle about her own affairs. “We’ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; Antonio says they’re the best rooms in Rome. We are going to stay all winter, if we don’t die of the fever; and I guess we’ll stay then. It’s a great deal nicer than I thought; I thought it would be fearfully quiet; I was sure it would be awfully poky. I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things. But we only had about a week of that, and now I’m enjoying myself. I know ever so many people, and they are all so charming. The society’s extremely select. There are all kinds—English, and Germans, and Italians. I think I like the English best. I like their style of conversation. But there are some lovely Americans. I never saw anything so hospitable. There’s something or other every day. There’s not much dancing; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything. I was always fond of conversation. I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs. Parker’s, her rooms are so small.” When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens, Violet began to wonder where Mr. Romano might be. “We had better go straight to that place in front,” she said, “where you look at the view.”\n\n“I certainly shall not help you to find him,” Alexander declared.\n\n“Then I shall find him without you,” cried Violet.\n\n“You certainly won’t leave me!” cried Alexander.\n\nShe burst into her little laugh. “Are you afraid you’ll get lost—or run over? But there’s Romano, leaning against that tree. He’s staring at the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?”\n\nAlexander perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. Alexander looked at him a moment and then said, “Do you mean to speak to that man?”\n\n“Do I mean to speak to him? Why, you don’t suppose I mean to communicate by signs?”\n\n“Pray understand, then,” said Alexander, “that I intend to remain with you.”\n\nViolet stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples. “Well, she’s a cool one!” thought the young man.\n\n“I don’t like the way you say that,” said Violet. “It’s too imperious.”\n\n“I beg your pardon if I say it wrong. The main point is to give you an idea of my meaning.”\n\nThe young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were prettier than ever. “I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me, or to interfere with anything I do.”\n\n“I think you have made a mistake,” said Alexander. “You should sometimes listen to a gentleman—the right one.”\n\nViolet began to laugh again. “I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!” she exclaimed. “Tell me if Mr. Romano is the right one?”\n\nThe gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity. He bowed to Alexander as well as to the latter’s companion; he had a brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; Alexander thought him not a bad-looking fellow. But he nevertheless said to Violet, “No, he’s not the right one.”\n\nViolet evidently had a natural talent for performing introducti", "context_order": 2, "question": "Where did Alexander and Violet go for their first excursion together?", "answer": "They went to Chillon."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Daisy Miller.txt", "context": "ons; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other. She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her; Mr. Romano, who spoke English very cleverly—Alexander afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses—addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the young American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. Romano, of course, had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a party of three. But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions. Alexander flattered himself that he had taken his measure. “He is not a gentleman,” said the young American; “he is only a clever imitation of one. He is a music master, or a penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. D__n his good looks!” Mr. Romano had certainly a very pretty face; but Alexander felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman’s not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Romano chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. “Nevertheless,” Alexander said to himself, “a nice girl ought to know!” And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl. Would a nice girl, even allowing for her being a little American flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner? The rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular though it may seem, Alexander was vexed that the young girl, in joining her amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his own company, and he was vexed because of his inclination. It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy. It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “lawless passions.” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing. But Violet, on this occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.\n\nShe had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed to Alexander, to the pretty speeches of Mr. Romano, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path. At the same moment Alexander perceived that his friend Mrs. Parker—the lady whose house he had lately left—was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him. Leaving Violet’s side, he hastened to obey her summons. Mrs. Parker was flushed; she wore an excited air. “It is really too dreadful,” she said. “That girl must not do this sort of thing. She must not walk here with you two men. Fifty people have noticed her.”\n\nAlexander raised his eyebrows. “I think it’s a pity to make too much fuss about it.”\n\n“It’s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!”\n\n“She is very innocent,” said Alexander.\n\n“She’s very crazy!” cried Mrs. Parker. “Did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother? After you had all left me just now, I could not sit still for thinking of it. It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt to save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!”\n\n“What do you propose to do with us?” asked Alexander, smiling.\n\n“To ask her to get in, to drive her about here for half an hour, so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild, and then to take her safely home.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s a very happy thought,” said Alexander; “but you can try.”\n\nMrs. Parker tried. The young man went in pursuit of Violet, who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion. Violet, on learning that Mrs. Parker wished to speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with Mr. Romano at her side. She declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to Mrs. Parker. She immediately achieved the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as Mrs. Parker’s carriage rug.\n\n“I am glad you admire it,” said this lady, smiling sweetly. “Will you get in and let me put it over you?”\n\n“Oh, no, thank you,” said Violet. “I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it.”\n\n“Do get in and drive with me!” said Mrs. Parker.\n\n“That would be charming, but it’s so enchanting just as I am!” and Violet gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her.\n\n“It may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here,” urged Mrs. Parker, leaning forward in her victoria, with her hands devoutly clasped.\n\n“Well, it ought to be, then!” said Violet. “If I didn’t walk I should expire.”\n\n“You should walk with your mother, dear,” cried the lady from Geneva, losing patience.\n\n“With my mother dear!” exclaimed the young girl. Alexander saw that she scented interference. “My mother never walked ten steps in her life. And then, you know,” she added with a laugh, “I am more than five years old.”\n\n“You are old enough to be more reasonable. You are old enough, dear Violet, to be talked about.”\n\nViolet looked at Mrs. Parker, smiling intensely. “Talked about? What do you mean?”\n\n“Come into my carriage, and I will tell you.”\n\nViolet turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other. Mr. Romano was bowing to and fro, rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably; Alexander thought it a most unpleasant scene. “I don’t think I want to know what you mean,” said Violet presently. “I don’t think I should like it.”\n\nAlexander wished that Mrs. Parker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward told him. “Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?” she demanded.\n\n“Gracious!” exclaimed Violet. She looked again at Mr. Romano, then she turned to Alexander. There was a little pink flush in her cheek; she was tremendously pretty. “Does Mr. Alexander think,” she asked slowly, smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from head to foot, “that, to save my reputation, I ought to get into the carriage?”\n\nAlexander colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. It seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her “reputation.” But he himself, in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. The finest gallantry, here, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for Alexander, as the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to the reader, was that Violet should take Mrs. Parker’s advice. He looked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, “I think you should get into the carriage.”\n\nViolet gave a violent laugh. “I never heard anything so stiff! If this is improper, Mrs. Parker,” she pursued, “then I am all improper, and you must give me up. Goodbye; I hope you’ll have a lovely ride!” and, with Mr. Romano, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.\n\nMrs. Parker sat looking after her, and there were tears in Mrs. Parker’s eyes. “Get in here, sir,” she said to Alexander, indicating the place beside her. The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Violet, whereupon Mrs. Parker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again. She was evidently in earnest. Alexander overtook Violet and her companion, and, offering the young girl his hand, told her that Mrs. Parker had made an imperious claim upon his society. He expected that in answer she would say something rather free, something to commit herself still further to that “recklessness” from which Mrs. Parker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her. But she only shook his hand, hardly looking at him, while Mr. Romano bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat.\n\nAlexander was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in Mrs. Parker’s victoria. “That was not clever of you,” he said candidly, while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages.\n\n“In such a case,” his companion answered, “I don’t wish to be clever; I wish to be EARNEST!”\n\n“Well, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.”\n\n“It has happened very well,” said Mrs. Parker. “If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one can act accordingly.”\n\n“I suspect she meant no harm,” Alexander rejoined.\n\n“So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far.”\n\n“What has she been doing?”\n\n“Everything that is not done here. Flirting with any man she could pick up; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the evening with the same partners; receiving visits at eleven o’clock at night. Her mother goes away when visitors come.”\n\n“But her brother,” said Alexander, laughing, “sits up till midnight.”\n\n“He must be edified by what he sees. I’m told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for Violet.”\n\n“The servants be hanged!” said Alexander angrily. “The poor girl’s only fault,” he presently added, “is that she is very uncultivated.”\n\n“She is naturally indelicate,” Mrs. Parker declared.\n\n“Take that example this morning. How long had you known her at Vevey?”\n\n“A couple of days.”\n\n“Fancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place!”\n\nAlexander was silent for some moments; then he said, “I suspect, Mrs. Parker, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva!” And he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage.\n\n“I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Violet—not to flirt with her—to give her no further opportunity to expose herself—to let her alone, in short.”\n\n“I’m afraid I can’t do that,” said Alexander. “I like her extremely.”\n\n“All the more reason that you shouldn’t help her to make a scandal.”\n\n“There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.”\n\n“There certainly will be in the way she takes them. But I have said what I had on my conscience,” Mrs. Parker pursued. “If you wish to rejoin the young lady I will put you down. Here, by the way, you have a chance.”\n\nThe carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese. It is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats. One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady, toward whom Mrs. Parker gave a toss of her head. At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet. Alexander had asked the coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. His companion looked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she drove majestically away. Alexander stood there; he had turned his eyes toward Violet and her cavalier. They evidently saw no one; they were too deeply occupied with each other. When they reached the low garden wall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese; then Romano seated himself, familiarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars, whereupon Violet’s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it. She came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from Alexander. This young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. But he walked—not toward the couple with the parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, Mrs. Fitzgerald.\n\nHe flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he, at least, asked for Mrs. Clark at her hotel. This lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day after, repeating his visit, Alexander again had the misfortune not to find them. Mrs. Parker’s party took place on the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, Alexander was among the guests. Mrs. Parker was one of those American ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of studying European society, and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. When Alexander arrived, Violet was not there, but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. Mrs. Clark’s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. As she approached Mrs. Parker, Alexander also drew near.\n\n“You see, I’ve come all alone,” said poor Mrs. Clark. “I’m so frightened; I don’t know what to do. It’s the first time I’ve ever been to a party alone, especially in this country. I wanted to bring Lucas or Antonio, or someone, but Violet just pushed me off by myself. I ain’t used to going round alone.”\n\n“And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?” demanded Mrs. Parker impressively.\n\n“Well, Violet’s all dressed,” said Mrs. Clark with that accent of the dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter’s career. “She got dressed on purpose before dinner. But she’s got a friend of hers there; that gentleman—the Italian—that she wanted to bring. They’ve got going at the piano; it seems as if they couldn’t leave off. Mr. Romano sings splendidly. But I guess they’ll come before very long,” concluded Mrs. Clark hopefully.\n\n“I’m sorry she should come in that way,” said Mrs. Parker.\n\n“Well, I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours,” responded Violet’s mamma. “I didn’t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with Mr. Romano.”\n\n“This is most horrible!” said Mrs. Parker, turning away and addressing herself to Alexander. “Elle s’affiche. It’s her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her. When she comes, I shall not speak to her.”\n\nViolet came after eleven o’clock; but she was not, on such an occasion, a young lady to wait to be spoken to. She rustled forward in radiant loveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and attended by Mr. Romano. Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her. She came straight to Mrs. Parker. “I’m afraid you thought I never was coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make Mr. Romano practice some things before he came; you know he sings beautifully, and I want you to ask him to sing. This is Mr. Romano; you know I introduced him to you; he’s got the most lovely voice, and he knows the most charming set of songs. I made him go over them this evening on purpose; we had the greatest time at the hotel.” Of all this Violet delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness, looking now at her hostess and now round the room, while she gave a series of little pats, round her shoulders, to the edges of her dress. “Is there anyone I know?” she asked.\n\n“I think every one knows you!” said Mrs. Parker pregnantly, and she gave a very cursory greeting to Mr. Romano. This gentleman bore himself gallantly. He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome Italian at an evening party. He sang very prettily half a dozen songs, though Mrs. Parker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him. It was apparently not Violet who had given him his orders. Violet sat at a distance from the piano, and though she had publicly, as it were, professed a high admiration for his singing, talked, not inaudibly, while it was going on.\n\n“It’s a pity these rooms are so small; we can’t dance,” she said to Alexander, as if she had seen him five minutes before.\n\n“I am not sorry we can’t dance,” Alexander answered; “I don’t dance.”\n\n“Of course you don’t dance; you’re too stiff,” said Violet. “I hope you enjoyed your drive with Mrs. Parker!”\n\n“No. I didn’t enjoy it; I preferred walking with you.”\n\n“We paired off: that was much better,” said Violet. “But did you ever hear anything so cool as Mrs. Parker’s wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor Mr. Romano, and under the pretext that it was proper? People have different ideas! It would have been most unkind; he had been talking about that walk for ten days.”\n\n“He should not have talked about it at all,” said Alexander; “he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him.”\n\n“About the streets?” cried Violet with her pretty stare. “Where, then, would he have proposed to her to walk? The Pincio is not the streets, either; and I, thank goodness, am not a young lady of this country. The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far as I can learn; I don’t see why I should change my habits for THEM.”\n\n“I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt,” said Alexander gravely.\n\n“Of course they are,” she cried, giving him her little smiling stare again. “I’m a fearful, frightful flirt! Did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice girl.”\n\n“You’re a very nice girl; but I wish you would flirt with me, and me only,” said Alexander.\n\n“Ah! thank you—thank you very much; you are the last man I should think of flirting with. As I have had the pleasure of informing you, you are too stiff.”\n\n“You say that too often,” said Alexander.\n\nViolet gave a delighted laugh. “If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry, I should say it again.”\n\n“Don’t do that; when I am angry I’m stiffer than ever. But if you won’t flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the piano; they don’t understand that sort of thing here.”\n\n“I thought they understood nothing else!” exclaimed Violet.\n\n“Not in young unmarried women.”\n\n“It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones,” Violet declared.\n\n“Well,” said Alexander, “when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place. Flirting is a purely American custom; it doesn’t exist here. So when you show yourself in public with Mr. Romano, and without your mother—”\n\n“Gracious! poor Mother!” interposed Violet.\n\n“Though you may be flirting, Mr. Romano is not; he means something else.”\n\n“He isn’t preaching, at any rate,” said Violet with vivacity. “And if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends.”\n\n“Ah!” rejoined Alexander, “if you are in love with each other, it is another affair.”\n\nShe had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation; but she immediately got up, blushing visibly, and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world. “Mr. Romano, at least,” she said, giving her interlocutor a single glance, “never says such very disagreeable things to me.”\n\nAlexander was bewildered; he stood, staring. Mr. Romano had finished singing. He left the piano and came over to Violet. “Won’t you come into the other room and have some tea?” he asked, bending before her with his ornamental smile.\n\nViolet turned to Alexander, beginning to smile again. He was still more perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though it seemed to prove, indeed, that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. “It has never occurred to Mr. Alexander to offer me any tea,” she said with her little tormenting manner.\n\n“I have offered you advice,” Alexander rejoined.\n\n“I prefer weak tea!” cried Violet, and she went off with the brilliant Romano. She sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure of the window, for the rest of the evening. There was an interesting performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed to it. When Violet came to take leave of Mrs. Parker, this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girl’s arrival. She turned her back straight upon Violet and left her to depart with what grace she might. Alexander was standing near the door; he saw it all. Violet turned very pale and looked at her mother, but Mrs. Clark was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. She appeared, indeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them. “Good night, Mrs. Parker,” she said; “we’ve had a beautiful evening. You see, if I let Violet come to parties without me, I don’t want her to go away without me.” Violet turned away, looking with a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; Alexander saw that, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation. He on his side was greatly touched.\n\n“That was very cruel,” he said to Mrs. Parker.\n\n“She never enters my drawing room again!” replied his hostess.\n\nSince Alexander was not to meet her in Mrs. Parker’s drawing room, he went as often as possible to Mrs. Clark’s hotel. The ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted Romano was always present. Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with Violet alone, Mrs. Clark being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance. Alexander noted, at first with surprise, that Violet on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect. She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with Romano being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility. Alexander remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in Romano, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. He could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader’s part, I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to Alexander among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraid—literally afraid—of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of Violet. It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to Violet; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.\n\nBut she was evidently very much interested in Romano. She looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly “chaffing” and abusing him. She appeared completely to have forgotten that Alexander had said anything to displease her at Mrs. Parker’s little party. One Sunday afternoon, having gone to St. Peter’s with his aunt, Alexander perceived Violet strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable Romano. Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to Mrs. Fitzgerald. This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass, and then she said:\n\n“That’s what makes you ", "context_order": 3, "question": "What does Alexander think of Mr. Romano after observing his behavior with Violet?", "answer": "Alexander believes that Mr. Romano is not a gentleman but a clever imitation."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Daisy Miller.txt", "context": "so pensive in these days, eh?”\n\n“I had not the least idea I was pensive,” said the young man.\n\n“You are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.”\n\n“And what is it,” he asked, “that you accuse me of thinking of?”\n\n“Of that young lady’s—Miss Baker’s, Miss Chandler’s—what’s her name?—Violet’s intrigue with that little barber’s block.”\n\n“Do you call it an intrigue,” Alexander asked—“an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity?”\n\n“That’s their folly,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald; “it’s not their merit.”\n\n“No,” rejoined Alexander, with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded. “I don’t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue.”\n\n“I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him.”\n\n“They are certainly very intimate,” said Alexander.\n\nMrs. Fitzgerald inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument. “He is very handsome. One easily sees how it is. She thinks him the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. She has never seen anything like him; he is better, even, than the courier. It was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission.”\n\n“I don’t believe she thinks of marrying him,” said Alexander, “and I don’t believe he hopes to marry her.”\n\n“You may be very sure she thinks of nothing. She goes on from day to day, from hour to hour, as they did in the Golden Age. I can imagine nothing more vulgar. And at the same time,” added Mrs. Fitzgerald, “depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is ‘engaged.’”\n\n“I think that is more than Romano expects,” said Alexander.\n\n“Who is Romano?”\n\n“The little Italian. I have asked questions about him and learned something. He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. I believe he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. But he doesn’t move in what are called the first circles. I think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him. He is evidently immensely charmed with Violet. If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world, he, on his side, has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness as this young lady’s. And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting. I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. That must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. He has nothing but his handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in that mysterious land of dollars. Romano knows that he hasn’t a title to offer. If he were only a count or a marchese! He must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him up.”\n\n“He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Violet a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!” said Mrs. Fitzgerald.\n\n“It is very true,” Alexander pursued, “that Violet and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage of—what shall I call it?—of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. I believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception.”\n\n“Ah! but the avvocato can’t believe it,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald.\n\nOf the observation excited by Violet’s “intrigue,” Alexander gathered that day at St. Peter’s sufficient evidence. A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Fitzgerald, who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters. The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir, and meanwhile, between Mrs. Fitzgerald and her friends, there was a great deal said about poor little Violet’s going really “too far.” Alexander was not pleased with what he heard, but when, coming out upon the great steps of the church, he saw Violet, who had emerged before him, get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome, he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed. He felt very sorry for her—not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head, but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended, and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder. He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Clark. He met one day in the Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come out of the Doria Palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery. His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace, and then said, “And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind—that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week.” In answer to Alexander’s inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty American girl—prettier than ever—was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.\n\n“Who was her companion?” asked Alexander.\n\n“A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. The girl is delightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde.”\n\n“So she is!” answered Alexander; and having assured himself that his informant had seen Violet and her companion but five minutes before, he jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Clark. She was at home; but she apologized to him for receiving him in Violet’s absence.\n\n“She’s gone out somewhere with Mr. Romano,” said Mrs. Clark. “She’s always going round with Mr. Romano.”\n\n“I have noticed that they are very intimate,” Alexander observed.\n\n“Oh, it seems as if they couldn’t live without each other!” said Mrs. Clark. “Well, he’s a real gentleman, anyhow. I keep telling Violet she’s engaged!”\n\n“And what does Violet say?”\n\n“Oh, she says she isn’t engaged. But she might as well be!” this impartial parent resumed; “she goes on as if she was. But I’ve made Mr. Romano promise to tell me, if SHE doesn’t. I should want to write to Mr. Miller about it—shouldn’t you?”\n\nAlexander replied that he certainly should; and the state of mind of Violet’s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard.\n\nAfter this Violet was never at home, and Alexander ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived, these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far. They ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that, though Violet was a young American lady, her behavior was not representative—was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. Alexander wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her, and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all. He said to himself that she was too light and childish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have reflected upon her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced. He asked himself whether Violet’s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her being, essentially, a young person of the reckless class. It must be admitted that holding one’s self to a belief in Violet’s “innocence” came to seem to Alexander more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry. As I have already had occasion to relate, he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic, national, and how far they were personal. From either view of them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too late. She was “carried away” by Mr. Romano.\n\nA few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the Caesars. The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume, and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure. Violet was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions. It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just then. He stood, looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors, and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion. It seemed to him also that Violet had never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her. Romano was at her side, and Romano, too, wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy.\n\n“Well,” said Violet, “I should think you would be lonesome!”\n\n“Lonesome?” asked Alexander.\n\n“You are always going round by yourself. Can’t you get anyone to walk with you?”\n\n“I am not so fortunate,” said Alexander, “as your companion.”\n\nRomano, from the first, had treated Alexander with distinguished politeness. He listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries; he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that Alexander was a superior young man. He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviously a great deal of tact; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him. It even seemed to Alexander at times that Romano would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him—to say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady, and didn’t flatter himself with delusive—or at least TOO delusive—hopes of matrimony and dollars. On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole.\n\n“I know why you say that,” said Violet, watching Romano. “Because you think I go round too much with HIM.” And she nodded at her attendant.\n\n“Every one thinks so—if you care to know,” said Alexander.\n\n“Of course I care to know!” Violet exclaimed seriously. “But I don’t believe it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don’t really care a straw what I do. Besides, I don’t go round so much.”\n\n“I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably.”\n\nViolet looked at him a moment. “How disagreeably?”\n\n“Haven’t you noticed anything?” Alexander asked.\n\n“I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you.”\n\n“You will find I am not so stiff as several others,” said Alexander, smiling.\n\n“How shall I find it?”\n\n“By going to see the others.”\n\n“What will they do to me?”\n\n“They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?”\n\nViolet was looking at him intently; she began to color. “Do you mean as Mrs. Parker did the other night?”\n\n“Exactly!” said Alexander.\n\nShe looked away at Romano, who was decorating himself with his almond blossom. Then looking back at Alexander, “I shouldn’t think you would let people be so unkind!” she said.\n\n“How can I help it?” he asked.\n\n“I should think you would say something.”\n\n“I do say something;” and he paused a moment. “I say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged.”\n\n“Well, she does,” said Violet very simply.\n\nAlexander began to laugh. “And does Lucas believe it?” he asked.\n\n“I guess Lucas doesn’t believe anything,” said Violet. Lucas’s skepticism excited Alexander to further hilarity, and he observed that Romano was coming back to them. Violet, observing it too, addressed herself again to her countryman. “Since you have mentioned it,” she said, “I AM engaged.” * * * Alexander looked at her; he had stopped laughing. “You don’t believe!” she added.\n\nHe was silent a moment; and then, “Yes, I believe it,” he said.\n\n“Oh, no, you don’t!” she answered. “Well, then—I am not!”\n\nThe young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure, so that Alexander, who had but lately entered, presently took leave of them. A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the Caelian Hill, and, on arriving, dismissed his hired vehicle. The evening was charming, and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum. There was a waning moon in the sky, and her radiance was not brilliant, but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it. When, on his return from the villa (it was eleven o’clock), Alexander approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of the picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well worth a glance. He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches, near which, as he observed, an open carriage—one of the little Roman streetcabs—was stationed. Then he passed in, among the cavernous shadows of the great structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent arena. The place had never seemed to him more impressive. One-half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade, the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk. As he stood there he began to murmur Byron’s famous lines, out of “Manfred,” but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets, they are deprecated by the doctors. The historic atmosphere was there, certainly; but the historic atmosphere, scientifically considered, was no better than a villainous miasma. Alexander walked to the middle of the arena, to take a more general glance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat. The great cross in the center was covered with shadow; it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly. Then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base. One of these was a woman, seated; her companion was standing in front of her.\n\nPresently the sound of the woman’s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air. “Well, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the Christian martyrs!” These were the words he heard, in the familiar accent of Violet.\n\n“Let us hope he is not very hungry,” responded the ingenious Romano. “He will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!”\n\nAlexander stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Violet’s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect. He stood there, looking at her—looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible. He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Violet. Then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. He turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard Violet speak again.\n\n“Why, it was Mr. Alexander! He saw me, and he cuts me!”\n\nWhat a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! But he wouldn’t cut her. Alexander came forward again and went toward the great cross. Violet had got up; Romano lifted his hat. Alexander had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. What if she WERE a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa. “How long have you been here?” he asked almost brutally.\n\nViolet, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment. Then—“All the evening,” she answered, gently. * * * “I never saw anything so pretty.”\n\n“I am afraid,” said Alexander, “that you will not think Roman fever very pretty. This is the way people catch it. I wonder,” he added, turning to Romano, “that you, a native Roman, should countenance such a terrible indiscretion.”\n\n“Ah,” said the handsome native, “for myself I am not afraid.”\n\n“Neither am I—for you! I am speaking for this young lady.”\n\nRomano lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth. But he took Alexander’s rebuke with docility. “I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?”\n\n“I never was sick, and I don’t mean to be!” the signorina declared. “I don’t look like much, but I’m healthy! I was bound to see the Colosseum by moonlight; I shouldn’t have wanted to go home without that; and we have had the most beautiful time, haven’t we, Mr. Romano? If there has been any danger, Antonio can give me some pills. He has got some splendid pills.”\n\n“I should advise you,” said Alexander, “to drive home as fast as possible and take one!”\n\n“What you say is very wise,” Romano rejoined. “I will go and make sure the carriage is at hand.” And he went forward rapidly.\n\nViolet followed with Alexander. He kept looking at her; she seemed not in the least embarrassed. Alexander said nothing; Violet chattered about the beauty of the place. “Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight!” she exclaimed. “That’s one good thing.” Then, noticing Alexander’s silence, she asked him why he didn’t speak. He made no answer; he only began to laugh. They passed under one of the dark archways; Romano was in front with the carriage. Here Violet stopped a moment, looking at the young American. “DID you believe I was engaged, the other day?” she asked.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what I believed the other day,” said Alexander, still laughing.\n\n“Well, what do you believe now?”\n\n“I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!”\n\nHe felt the young girl’s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. But Romano hurried her forward. “Quick! quick!” he said; “if we get in by midnight we are quite safe.”\n\nViolet took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate Italian placed himself beside her. “Don’t forget Antonio’s pills!” said Alexander as he lifted his hat.\n\n“I don’t care,” said Violet in a little strange tone, “whether I have Roman fever or not!” Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.\n\nAlexander, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he had encountered Violet, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little American circle, and commented accordingly. Alexander reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after Violet’s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver. But the young man was conscious, at the same moment, that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be “talked about” by low-minded menials. These people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little American flirt was alarmingly ill. Alexander, when the rumor came to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being entertained in Mrs. Clark’s salon by Lucas.\n\n“It’s going round at night,” said Lucas—“that’s what made her sick. She’s always going round at night. I shouldn’t think she’d want to, it’s so plaguy dark. You can’t see anything here at night, except when there’s a moon. In America there’s always a moon!” Mrs. Clark was invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her society. It was evident that Violet was dangerously ill.\n\nAlexander went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs. Clark, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse. She talked a good deal about Dr. Bennett, but Alexander paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose. “Violet spoke of you the other day,” she said to him. “Half the time she doesn’t know what she’s saying, but that time I think she did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you. She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure I am very glad; Mr. Romano hasn’t been near us since she was taken ill. I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don’t call that very polite! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Violet round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I’m a lady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she’s not engaged. I don’t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, ‘Mind you tell Mr. Alexander.’ And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said I wouldn’t give any such messages as that. Only, if she is not engaged, I’m sure I’m glad to know it.”\n\nBut, as Alexander had said, it mattered very little. A week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. Violet’s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers. Alexander stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady’s career would have led you to expect. Near him stood Romano, who came nearer still before Alexander turned away. Romano was very pale: on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say something. At last he said, “She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the most amiable;” and then he added in a moment, “and she was the most innocent.”\n\nAlexander looked at him and presently repeated his words, “And the most innocent?”\n\n“The most innocent!”\n\nAlexander felt sore and angry. “Why the devil,” he asked, “did you take her to that fatal place?”\n\nMr. Romano’s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. He looked on the ground a moment, and then he said, “For myself I had no fear; and she wanted to go.”\n\n“That was no reason!” Alexander declared.\n\nThe subtle Roman again dropped his eyes. “If she had lived, I should have got nothing. She would never have married me, I am sure.”\n\n“She would never have married you?”\n\n“For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure.”\n\nAlexander listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies. When he turned away again, Mr. Romano, with his light, slow step, had retired.\n\nAlexander almost immediately left Rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, Mrs. Fitzgerald at Vevey. Mrs. Fitzgerald was fond of Vevey. In the interval Alexander had often thought of Violet and her mystifying manners. One day he spoke of her to his aunt—said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.\n\n“I am sure I don’t know,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald. “How did your injustice affect her?”\n\n“She sent me a message before her death which I didn’t understand at the time; but I have understood it since. She would have appreciated one’s esteem.”\n\n“Is that a modest way,” asked Mrs. Fitzgerald, “of saying that she would have reciprocated one’s affection?”\n\nAlexander offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, “You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked to make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts.”\n\nNevertheless, he went back to live at Geneva, whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report that he is “studying” hard—an intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady.\n", "context_order": 4, "question": "Where did Alexander first learn that Violet spends frequent time with Mr. Romano?", "answer": "At the Corso when talking to Mrs. Clark."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Metamorphosis.txt", "context": "\nOne morning, when Victor Harlan woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\n\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\n\nVictor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.\n\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.\n\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.”\n\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. “God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Victor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service Victor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Victor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\n\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. “Victor”, somebody called—it was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Victor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Victor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Victor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Victor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Victor, Victor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: “Victor! Victor!” At the other side door his sister came plaintively: “Victor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?” Victor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Victor, open the door, I beg of you.” Victor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.\n\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\n\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Victor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\n\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\n\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.\n\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.\n\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\n\nWhen Victor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.\n\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Victor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Victor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Victor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Victor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.\n\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on the left. Victor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Victor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Victor, the chief clerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Victor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\n\n“Victor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Harlan”. “He isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Victor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as soon as Victor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Victor to open the door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Victor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Harlan”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Victor. In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.\n\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet. Victor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Victor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemed to Victor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.\n\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Harlan”, he called to him, “what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Harlan, we cannot allow there to be.”\n\n“But Sir”, called Victor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\n\nAnd while Victor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Victor’s responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\n\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Elsa! Elsa!” she then cried. “Mother?” his sister called from the other side. They communicated across Victor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Victor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Victor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened.\n\nVictor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not really ", "context_order": 0, "question": "What was hanging on Victor's wall in a gilded frame?", "answer": "A picture of a lady with a fur hat and fur boa."}

Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.\n\nVictor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Victor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: “Well done, Victor”, they should have cried, “keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Victor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.\n\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Victor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Victor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Victor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\n\nSo Victor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Victor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Victor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.\n\n“Now, then”, said Victor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least partly right!”\n\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Victor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Victor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\n\nVictor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Victor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Victor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Victor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Victor was still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Victor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Victor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Victor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\n\n“Mother, mother”, said Victor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Victor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time. Victor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Victor’s father into a panic as well. Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Victor as he ran after him, Victor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Victor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went. Victor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Victor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Victor’s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Victor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If Victor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Victor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making Victor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Victor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Victor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Victor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Victor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Victor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Victor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.\n\nII\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Victor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Victor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\n\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.\n\nThrough the crack in the door, Victor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Victor’s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Victor’s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Victor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Victor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.\n\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Victor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Victor waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.\n\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Victor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life. For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\n\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\n\nVictor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Victor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out. Victor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Victor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Victor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for Victor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Victor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. Victor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out. She had hardly turned her back before Victor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.\n\nThis was how Victor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Victor’s sister would send the maid away on some errand. Victor’s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than the", "context_order": 1, "question": "What did Victor’s sister first bring him to eat after his transformation?", "answer": "A dish filled with sweetened milk and pieces of white bread."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Metamorphosis.txt", "context": "y could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\n\nIt was impossible for Victor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation—that Victor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his dinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s just been left there again”.\n\nAlthough Victor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Victor’s mother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Victor’s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\n\nNow Victor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Victor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\n\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Victor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. Victor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Victor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Victor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Victor’s only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. Victor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Victor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They had even got used to it, both Victor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. Victor only remained close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Victor’s short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Victor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\n\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing now”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.\n\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Victor’s mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Victor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Victor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Victor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.\n\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Victor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Victor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.\n\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.\n\nIf Victor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Victor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Victor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Victor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.\n\nOne day, about a month after Victor’s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Victor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. Victor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Victor to cut himself off so completely. She left the sheet where it was. Victor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.\n\nFor the first fourteen days, Victor’s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Victor’s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Victor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit Victor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. Victor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: “Let me go and see Victor, he is my unfortunate son! Can’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Victor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\n\nVictor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Victor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his sister noticed Victor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Victor’s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Victor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent. First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Victor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Victor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You can come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Victor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Victor’s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Victor feel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Victor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like we’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Victor comes back to us again he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier”.\n\nHearing these words from his mother made Victor realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.\n\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Victor’s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his mother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Victor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all. Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted Elsa to make Victor’s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him. Elsa would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Victor crawling about the bare walls by himself.\n\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Victor’s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Victor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest of drawers was something that Victor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Victor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Elsa in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His mother was not used to the sight of Victor, he might have made her ill, so Victor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention. She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Elsa.\n\nVictor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides. With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.\n\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Victor, would certainly be taken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.\n\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Elsa had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. “What shall we take now, then?”, said Elsa and looked around. Her eyes met those of Victor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: “Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Victor could see what Elsa had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Elsa’s face.\n\nBut Elsa’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Victor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Victor!” shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Victor wanted to help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, r", "context_order": 2, "question": "What was Elsa's reaction when she saw Victor staring at her from the wall?", "answer": "She remained calm, bent her face to her mother and suggested going back to the living room."}

So now Victor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.\n\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Elsa would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s happened?” were his first words; Elsa’s appearance must have made everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s better now. Victor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father, “just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It was clear to Victor that Elsa had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence. That meant Victor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Victor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.\n\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; “Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time. Victor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Victor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Victor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Victor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Victor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Victor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Victor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Victor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Victor’s back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Victor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally—now Victor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind his father’s head begging him to spare Victor’s life.\n\nIII\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Victor’s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Victor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\n\nBecause of his injuries, Victor had lost much of his mobility—probably permanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling over the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.\n\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that Victor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Victor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again today!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.\n\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Victor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Victor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Victor’s mother and sister to look after it. Victor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.\n\nAs soon as it struck ten, Victor’s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Victor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Victor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Victor’s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.\n\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Victor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Victor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Victor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Victor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Victor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Victor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Victor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Victor’s room and say “Close that door, Elsa”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.\n\nVictor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Victor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Victor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood—cleaning up Victor’s room was for her and her alone. Victor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also made Victor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Victor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Victor’s father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Victor’s room to his sister; from her left, Victor’s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Victor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Victor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\n\nVictor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Victor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Victor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really repelled by Victor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Victor’s room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!” Victor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again. Victor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Victor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any closer, then?”, she asked when Victor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.\n\nVictor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Victor learned peering through the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on things’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Victor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Victor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.\n\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Victor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, formerly, Victor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Victor’s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Victor’s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.\n\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Victor’s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Victor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Victor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to eat something”, said Victor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\n\nThroughout all this time, Victor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Victor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the ", "context_order": 3, "question": "What injury did Victor suffer when the bottle broke?", "answer": "A splinter cut his face, and caustic medicine splashed all over him."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "Metamorphosis.txt", "context": "contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back Victor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Victor’s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it—out of the way in a corner.\n\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Victor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.\n\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Victor’s sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Victor’s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Victor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Victor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Victor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\n\n“Mr. Harlan!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Victor’s father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Victor as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Victor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Victor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Victor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Victor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Victor in the next room without knowing it. They asked Victor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Victor’s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. Victor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Victor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and now”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Victor’s mother and sister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate notice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.\n\nVictor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Victor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.\n\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but I can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.”\n\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Victor’s father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.\n\nVictor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Victor’s father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Victor as he lay there immobile.\n\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Victor’s sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\n\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, “what are we to do?”\n\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\n\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.\n\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Victor’s father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite impossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is ...”\n\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father. You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Victor. We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Victor? If it were Victor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is this animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s starting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Victor’s comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Victor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Victor’s sister as if to protect her.\n\nBut Victor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\n\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Victor and went back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.\n\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Victor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Victor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\n\n“What now, then?”, Victor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.\n\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual brief look in on Victor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Victor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there, stone dead!”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Harlan sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr. Harlan threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Harlan just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Victor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Elsa had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Harlan, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I said”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Victor’s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Harlan made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Harlan, “let’s give thanks to God for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Elsa, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in”. Victor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.\n\n“Elsa, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Harlan with a pained smile, and Elsa followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all.\n\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where is our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Victor’s room. They did so, and stood around Victor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\n\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Harlan appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Elsa now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm.\n\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Harlan, indicating the door and without letting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr. Harlan, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr. Harlan as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Harlan for his decision. Mr. Harlan merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Harlan might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. Mr. Harlan and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Harlan and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.\n\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Harlan to his employers, Mrs. Harlan to her contractor and Elsa to her principal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”, asked Mr. Harlan. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Harlan all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Harlan, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then, that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Harlan and Elsa bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Harlan saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\n\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Harlan, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Harlan twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.\n\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Victor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Elsa was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Harlan were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. They became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Elsa was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.\n", "context_order": 4, "question": "What instrument does Victor’s sister play when the family entertains the three gentlemen?", "answer": "Violin."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "THE GOLD-BUG.txt", "context": "\nMany years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. Oliver Stern. He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThis Island is a very singular one. It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance.\n\nIn the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Stern had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance. This soon ripened into friendship—for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many books, but rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological specimens—his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Maxwell Brody, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young “Master Oliver.” It is not improbable that the relatives of Stern, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Maxwell Brody, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.\n\nThe winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18—, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks—my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.\n\nSoon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome. Maxwell Brody, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper. Stern was in one of his fits—how else shall I term them?—of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Maxwell Brody’s assistance, a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.\n\n“And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil.\n\n“Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Stern, “but it’s so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant R——, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!”\n\n“What?—sunrise?”\n\n“Nonsense! no!—the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color—about the size of a large hickory-nut—with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antennæ are—”\n\n“Dey aint no tin in him, Master Oliver, I keep a tellin on you,” here interrupted Maxwell Brody; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing—neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life.”\n\n“Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Stern, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason for your letting the birds burn? The color”—here he turned to me—“is really almost enough to warrant Maxwell Brody’s idea. You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit—but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.” Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.\n\n“Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Maxwell Brody opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Stern, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.\n\n“Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this is a strange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before—unless it was a skull, or a death’s-head—which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.”\n\n“A death’s-head!” echoed Stern. “Oh—yes—well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth—and then the shape of the whole is oval.”\n\n“Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Stern, I fear you are no artist. I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance.”\n\n“Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably—should do it at least—have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a very passable skull—indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology—and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis, or something of that kind—there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories. But where are the antennæ you spoke of?”\n\n“The antennæ!” said Stern, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; “I am sure you must see the antennæ. I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient.”\n\n“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have—still I don’t see them;” and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me—and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennæ visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.\n\nHe received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew violently red—in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality.\n\nIt was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen nothing of Stern) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man, Maxwell Brody. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\n\n“Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?—how is your master?”\n\n“Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.”\n\n“Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?”\n\n“Dar! dat’s it!—him neber ’plain of notin’—but him berry sick for all dat.”\n\n“Very sick, Maxwell Brody!—why didn’t you say so at once? Is he confined to bed?”\n\n“No, dat he aint!—he aint ’fin’d nowhar—dat’s just whar de shoe pinch—my mind is got to be berry hebby ’bout poor Master Oliver.”\n\n“Maxwell Brody, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about. You say your master is sick. Hasn’t he told you what ails him?”\n\n“Why, massa, ’taint worf while for to git mad about de matter—Master Oliver say noffin at all aint de matter wid him—but den what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white as a gose? And den he keep a syphon all de time—”\n\n“Keeps a what, Maxwell Brody?”\n\n“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate—de queerest figgurs I ebber did see. Ise gittin’ to be skeered, I tell you. Hab for to keep mighty tight eye ’pon him ’noovers. Todder day he gib me slip ’fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did come—but Ise sich a fool dat I hadn’t de heart arter all—he look so berry poorly.”\n\n“Eh?—what?—ah yes!—upon the whole I think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow—don’t flog him, Maxwell Brody—he can’t very well stand it—but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?”\n\n“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant since den—‘twas ’fore den I’m feared—‘twas de berry day you was dare.”\n\n“How? what do you mean?”\n\n“Why, massa, I mean de bug—dare now.”\n\n“The what?”\n\n“De bug,—I’m berry sartain dat Master Oliver bin bit somewhere ’bout de head by dat goole-bug.”\n\n“And what cause have you, Maxwell Brody, for such a supposition?”\n\n“Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too. I nebber did see sick a deuced bug—he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. Master Oliver cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go ’gin mighty quick, I tell you—den was de time he must ha’ got de bite. I did n’t like de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I would n’t take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff—dat was de way.”\n\n“And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle, and that the bite made him sick?”\n\n“I do n’t tink noffin about it—I nose it. What make him dream ’bout de goole so much, if ’taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd ’bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.”\n\n“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”\n\n“How I know? why ’cause he talk about it in he sleep—dat’s how I nose.”\n\n“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”\n\n“What de matter, massa?”\n\n“Did you bring any message from Mr. Stern?”\n\n“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Maxwell Brody handed me a note which ran thus:\n\n“MY DEAR ——Why have I not seen you for so long a time? I hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine; but no, that is improbable. Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety. I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at all.\n\n“I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions. Would you believe it?—he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, solus, among the hills on the main land. I verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.\n\n“I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.\n\n“If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Maxwell Brody. Do come. I wish to see you to-night, upon business of importance. I assure you that it is of the highest importance.\n\n“Ever yours,\n“WILLIAM LEGRAND”.\n\nThere was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Stern. What could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain? What “business of the highest importance” could he possibly have to transact? Maxwell Brody’s account of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend. Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.\n\nUpon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.\n\n“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired.\n\n“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”\n\n“Very true; but what are they doing here?”\n\n“Him de syfe and de spade what Master Oliver sis pon my buying for him in de town, and de debbil’s own lot of money I had to gib for ’em.”\n\n“But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Master Oliver’ going to do with scythes and spades?", "context_order": 0, "question": "On what occasion did Stern lend the bug to Lieutenant R——?", "answer": "As Stern was coming home on the night of the narrator's visit."}

But it’s all cum ob do bug.”\n\nFinding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Maxwell Brody, whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped into the boat and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived. Stern had been awaiting us in eager expectation. He grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from Lieutenant R——.\n\n“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the next morning. Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus. Do you know that Maxwell Brody is quite right about it?”\n\n“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\n\n“In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.” He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\n\n“This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant smile, “to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index. Maxwell Brody; bring me that scarabæus!”\n\n“What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug—you mus’ git him for your own self.” Hereupon Stern arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a scientific point of view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Maxwell Brody for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Stern’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.\n\n“I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug—”\n\n“My dear Stern,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly unwell, and had better use some little precautions. You shall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this. You are feverish and—”\n\n“Feel my pulse,” said he.\n\nI felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever.\n\n“But you may be ill and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to prescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next—”\n\n“You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.”\n\n“And how is this to be done?”\n\n“Very easily. Maxwell Brody and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can trust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.”\n\n“I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills?”\n\n“It has.”\n\n“Then, Stern, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”\n\n“I am sorry—very sorry—for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”\n\n“Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!—but stay!—how long do you propose to be absent?”\n\n“Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all events, by sunrise.”\n\n“And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your physician?”\n\n“Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.”\n\nWith a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four o’clock—Stern, Maxwell Brody, the dog, and myself. Maxwell Brody had with him the scythe and spades—the whole of which he insisted upon carrying—more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance. His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Stern contented himself with the scarabæus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”\n\nWe crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Stern led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.\n\nIn this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined. Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.\n\nThe natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Maxwell Brody, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance. When we reached this tree, Stern turned to Maxwell Brody, and asked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,\n\n“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”\n\n“Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about.”\n\n“How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Maxwell Brody.\n\n“Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go—and here—stop! take this beetle with you.”\n\n“De bug, Master Oliver!—de goole-bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in dismay—“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?—d—n if I do!”\n\n“If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string—but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”\n\n“What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; “always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger. Was only funnin any how. Me feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.\n\nIn youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Maxwell Brody, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.\n\n“Which way mus go now, Master Oliver?” he asked.\n\n“Keep up the largest branch—the one on this side,” said Stern. The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.\n\n“How much fudder is got for go?”\n\n“How high up are you?” asked Stern.\n\n“Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob de tree.”\n\n“Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you passed?”\n\n“One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis side.”\n\n“Then go one limb higher.”\n\nIn a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.\n\n“Now, Jup,” cried Stern, evidently much excited, “I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything strange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally at rest. I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Maxwell Brody’s voice was again heard.\n\n“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far—’tis dead limb putty much all de way.”\n\n“Did you say it was a dead limb, Maxwell Brody?” cried Stern in a quavering voice.\n\n“Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail—done up for sartain—done departed dis here life.”\n\n“What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Stern, seemingly in the greatest distress.\n\n“Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, “why come home and go to bed. Come now!—that’s a fine fellow. It’s getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”\n\n“Maxwell Brody,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”\n\n“Yes, Master Oliver, hear you ebber so plain.”\n\n“Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very rotten.”\n\n“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few moments, “but not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”\n\n“By yourself!—what do you mean?”\n\n“Why I mean de bug. ’Tis berry hebby bug. Spose I drop him down fuss, and den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one nigger.”\n\n“You infernal scoundrel!” cried Stern, apparently much relieved, “what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your neck. Look here, Maxwell Brody, do you hear me?”\n\n“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”\n\n“Well! now listen!—if you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”\n\n“I’m gwine, Master Oliver—deed I is,” replied the negro very promptly—“mos out to the eend now.”\n\n“Out to the end!” here fairly screamed Stern, “do you say you are out to the end of that limb?”\n\n“Soon be to de eend, massa,—o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis here pon de tree?”\n\n“Well!” cried Stern, highly delighted, “what is it?”\n\n“Why taint noffin but a skull—somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”\n\n“A skull, you say!—very well—how is it fastened to the limb?—what holds it on?”\n\n“Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my word—dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.”\n\n“Well now, Maxwell Brody, do exactly as I tell you—do you hear?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Pay attention, then—find the left eye of the skull.”\n\n“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”\n\n“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?”\n\n“Yes, I knows dat—knows all about dat—’tis my lef hand what I chops de wood wid.”\n\n“To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found it?”\n\nHere was a long pause. At length the negro asked,\n\n“Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull, too?—cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all—nebber mind! I got de lef eye now—here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?”\n\n“Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach—but be careful and not let go your hold of the string.”\n\n“All dat done, Master Oliver; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole—look out for him dare below!”\n\nDuring this colloquy no portion of Maxwell Brody’s person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood. The scarabæus hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Stern immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Maxwell Brody to let go the string and come down from the tree.\n\nDriving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet—", "context_order": 1, "question": "What did Maxwell Brody encounter at the end of the tree limb?", "answer": "A skull fastened to the tree with a large nail."}

At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Maxwell Brody and one to me, Stern begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible.\n\nTo speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity by a refusal. Could I have depended, indeed, upon Maxwell Brody’s aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus, or, perhaps, by Maxwell Brody’s obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.” A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions—especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas—and then I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech about the beetle’s being “the index of his fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity—to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained.\n\nThe lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts.\n\nWe dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity—or, rather, this was the apprehension of Stern;—for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Maxwell Brody, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.\n\nWhen the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Stern, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark. Maxwell Brody, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.\n\nWe had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Stern strode up to Maxwell Brody, and seized him by the collar. The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.\n\n“You scoundrel,” said Stern, hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth—“you infernal black villain!—speak, I tell you!—answer me this instant, without prevarication!—which—which is your left eye?”\n\n“Oh, my golly, Master Oliver! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared the terrified Maxwell Brody, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s attempt at a gouge.\n\n“I thought so!—I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Stern, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\n\n“Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up yet;” and he again led the way to the tulip-tree.\n\n“Maxwell Brody,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?”\n\n“De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any trouble.”\n\n“Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?”—here Stern touched each of Maxwell Brody’s eyes.\n\n“’Twas dis eye, massa—de lef eye—jis as you tell me,” and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated.\n\n“That will do—we must try it again.”\n\nHere my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position. Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.\n\nAround the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades. I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested—nay, even excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Stern—some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Maxwell Brody’s again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.\n\nAt sight of these the joy of Maxwell Brody could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment. He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.\n\nWe now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process—perhaps that of the bi-chloride of mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron—six in all—by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew back—trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.\n\nI shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed. Amazement was, of course, predominant. Stern appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. Maxwell Brody’s countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s visage to assume. He seemed stupefied—thunderstricken. Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:\n\n“And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug! de poor little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger?—answer me dat!”\n\nIt became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much time was spent in deliberation—so confused were the ideas of all. We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Maxwell Brody neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more immediately. We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.\n\nWe were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’ duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure.\n\nThe chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars—estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety—French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There was no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating. There were diamonds—some of them exceedingly large and fine—a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy;—three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings; rich chains—thirty of these, if I remember; eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; five gold censers of great value; a prodigious golden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. Many of them were very old, and as timekeepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion—but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.\n\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Stern, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.\n\n“You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabæus. You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death’s-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me—for I am considered a good artist—and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”\n\n“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.\n\n“No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle.

I knew that my design was very different in detail from this—although there was a certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline—at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connexion—a sequence of cause and effect—and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus. I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night’s adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.\n\n“When you had gone, and when Maxwell Brody was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession. The spot where we discovered the scarabæus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Maxwell Brody, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship’s long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\n\n“Well, Maxwell Brody picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant R——. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection. Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once—you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History. At the same time, without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.\n\n“You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. I looked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\n\n“No doubt you will think me fanciful—but I had already established a kind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment—not a paper—with a skull depicted upon it. You will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.\n\n“I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment is durable—almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection suggested some meaning—some relevancy—in the death’s-head. I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum—for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved.”\n\n“But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull—since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus?”\n\n“Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabæus, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.\n\n“At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. I was heated with exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, upon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it. You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.\n\n“I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care. Its outer edges—the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum—were far more distinct than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death’s-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.”\n\n“Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you—a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth—but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain—you will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat—pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”\n\n“But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”\n\n“Well, a kid then—pretty much the same thing.”\n\n“Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Stern. “You may have heard of one Captain Captain Blake. I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature; because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death’s-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal. But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else—of the body to my imagined instrument—of the text for my context.”\n\n“I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature.”\n\n“Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can scarcely say why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief;—but do you know that Maxwell Brody’s silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the series of accidents and coincidences—these were so very extraordinary. Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death’s-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?”\n\n“But proceed—I am all impatience.”\n\n“Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current—the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the Atlantic coast, by Captain Blake and his associates. These rumors must have had some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed. Had Captain Blake concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form. You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident—say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality—had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common. Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“But that Captain Blake’s accumulations were immense, is well known. I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit.”\n\n“But how did you proceed?”\n\n“I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now.”\n\nHere Stern, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to my inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head and the goat:\n\n“53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;1‡(;:‡*8†83(88)5*†\n;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*—4)8¶8*;4069285);)\n6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4(‡?3\n4;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;”\n\n“But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”\n\n“And yet,” said Stern, “the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a cipher—that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is known of Captain Blake, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple species—such, however, as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”\n\n“And you really solved it?”\n\n“Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.\n\n“In the present case—indeed in all cases of secret writing—the first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty was removed by the signature. The pun upon the word ‘Captain Blake’ is appreciable in no other language than the English. But for this consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.\n\n“You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively eas", "context_order": 3, "question": "What caused Stern to become aware of the skull design on the parchment?", "answer": "The heat from the fireplace made the skull become visible."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "THE GOLD-BUG.txt", "context": "y. In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured. But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent. Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:\n\nOf the character 8 there are 33.\n\n                          ;        “     26.\n                          4        “     19.\n                        ‡ )        “     16.\n                          *        “     13.\n                          5        “     12.\n                          6        “     11.\n                        † 1        “      8.\n                          0        “      6.\n                        9 2        “      5.\n                        : 3        “      4.\n                          ?        “      3.\n                          ¶        “      2.\n                         -.        “      1.\n“Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e. Afterwards, succession runs thus: a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z. E predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.\n\n“Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for something more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of the table is obvious—but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet. To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples—for e is doubled with great frequency in English—in such words, for example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’ ‘agree,’ &c. In the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although the cryptograph is brief.\n\n“Let us assume 8, then, as e. Now, of all words in the language, ‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation, the last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters, so arranged, they will most probably represent the word ‘the.’ Upon inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that ; represents t, 4 represents h, and 8 represents e—the last being now well confirmed. Thus a great step has been taken.\n\n“But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and terminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last instance but one, in which the combination ;48 occurs—not far from the end of the cipher. We know that the ; immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this ‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these characters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown—\n\nt eeth.\n\n“Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the ‘th,’ as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part. We are thus narrowed into\n\nt ee,\n\nand, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another letter, r, represented by (, with the words ‘the tree’ in juxtaposition.\n\n“Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the combination ;48, and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:\n\nthe tree ;4(‡?34 the,\n\nor, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:\n\nthe tree thr‡?3h the.\n\n“Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots, we read thus:\n\nthe tree thr...h the,\n\nwhen the word ‘through’ makes itself evident at once. But this discovery gives us three new letters, o, u and g, represented by ‡, ? and 3.\n\n“Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,\n\n83(88, or egree,\n\nwhich, plainly, is the conclusion of the word ‘degree,’ and gives us another letter, d, represented by †.\n\n“Four letters beyond the word ‘degree,’ we perceive the combination\n\n;46(;88.\n\n“Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots, as before, we read thus:\n\nth.rtee,\n\nan arrangement immediately suggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and again furnishing us with two new characters, i and n, represented by 6 and *.\n\n“Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the combination,\n\n53‡‡†.\n\n“Translating as before, we obtain\n\ngood,\n\nwhich assures us that the first letter is A, and that the first two words are ‘A good.’\n\n“It is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form, to avoid confusion.

I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, as unriddled. Here it is:\n\n“‘A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”\n\n“But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about ‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”\n\n“I confess,” replied Stern, “that the matter still wears a serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist.”\n\n“You mean, to punctuate it?”\n\n“Something of that kind.”\n\n“But how was it possible to effect this?”\n\n“I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution. Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object, would be nearly certain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding. Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus: ‘A good glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s seat—forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes—northeast and by north—main branch seventh limb east side—shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head—a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”\n\n“Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”\n\n“It left me also in the dark,” replied Stern, “for a few days; during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s Island, for any building which went by the name of the ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the island. I accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place. At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.\n\n“I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place. The ‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks—one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance. I clambered to its apex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.\n\n“While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. I made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.\n\n“The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it. Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock.\n\n“I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course, the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.\n\n“Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’ could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree, while ‘shoot from the left eye of the death’s head’ admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point—and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed.”\n\n“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?”\n\n“Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock.\n\n“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended by Maxwell Brody, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone. But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After much toil I found it. When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.”\n\n“I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt at digging, through Maxwell Brody’s stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”\n\n“Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the ‘shot’—that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the error would have been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my deep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.”\n\n“But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle—how excessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?”\n\n“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification. For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from the tree. An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.”\n\n“Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”\n\n“That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself. There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them—and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply. It is clear that Captain Blake—if Captain Blake indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not—it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor. But this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret.

Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected—so entirely novel—so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions—as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears.\n\nIt appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not positive about the date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm—unusually so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.\n\nThe origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Reginald Thumble—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly—then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed again.\n\nIn the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It appeared to be—yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Hilda Finkel, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Lars Finkel and his associates. But to return.\n\nThe balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected into a queue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.\n\nHaving descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Reginald Thumble. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.\n\nIn the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Reginald Thumble. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Snickle, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication:\n\n“To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.\n\n“Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Lars Finkel, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Lars Finkel himself. It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind—they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.\n\n“One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.\n\n“It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller’s stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded—partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means—for they were ignorant men—I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.\n\n“Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.\n\n“On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These—the keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.\n\n“Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Otto Vonn’s improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and ", "context_order": 0, "question": "What is the name of the person who disappeared from Rotterdam about five years ago and later claimed to have written the letter?", "answer": "Lars Finkel."}

Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.\n\n“It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.\n\n“In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it—not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.\n\n“Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause—my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. It is impossible—utterly impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I felt my eyes starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea overwhelmed me—and at length I fainted away.\n\n“How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.\n\n“My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Lars Finkel would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car.\n\n“It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it six o’clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen.\n\n“It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life itself I had any positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live—to leave the world, yet continue to exist—in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.\n\n“The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval, but it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon’s orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1,080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.\n\n“The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s diameter—that is, not exceeding eighty miles—the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Drake Vaylen and Niklaus Riven. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.\n\n“But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.\n\n“On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet’s ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun’s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But again:—The real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Severin Drax, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2) Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet’s ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.\n\n“Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Otto Vonn, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.\n\n“It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing—I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was ", "context_order": 1, "question": "What animals did the narrator bring aboard the balloon before taking off?", "answer": "A pair of pigeons and a cat."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAAL.txt", "context": "only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it—that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending—for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth’s attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.\n\n“There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.(*3) This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels—not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish—and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.\n\n“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.\n\n“Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.\n\n“At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth’s area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine—that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me—was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface. ‘As five miles, then, to eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of the earth’s area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears—still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.\n\n“At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud—that is to say—had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.\n\n“I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner—bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea.\n\n“By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.\n\n“The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible.\n\n“The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.\n\n“At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work—in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops—not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened—but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\n\n“In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.\n\n“About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car—the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner—the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.\n\n“By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o’clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease—and indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was ", "context_order": 2, "question": "At what altitude did the narrator start experiencing severe pain in the head and noticed blood oozing from his ears?", "answer": "Nine miles and a half."}

Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.\n\n“At twenty minutes before nine o’clock—that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.\n\n“At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity—being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.\n\n“By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there were hoary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed. “This then,” I said thoughtfully, “is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on.” But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.\n\n“At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.\n\n“At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.\n\n“At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.\n\n“It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf—but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world.\n\n“It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o’clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.\n\n“April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption.\n\n“April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books.\n\n“April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.\n\n“April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth’s form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it.\n\n“April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth’s major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could be ascertained. By twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.\n\n“April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5° 8′ 48″.\n\n“April 9th. To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.\n\n“April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o’clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiet", "context_order": 3, "question": "At what time did the entire surface in view become enveloped in darkness on April 2nd?", "answer": "At five minutes before seven."}

Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full. It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.\n\n“April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar ellipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route—a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.\n\n“April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great decrease in the earth’s apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still continued in the plane of the ellipse, but made little progress to the eastward.\n\n“April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee—in other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view. Great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.\n\n“April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About twelve o’clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon. When my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a better appellation.\n\n“April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension.\n\n“April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered beneath me—my teeth chattered—my hair started up on end. ‘The balloon, then, had actually burst!’ These were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: ‘The balloon had positively burst!—I was falling—falling with the most impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!’ But at length reflection came to my relief. I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible. I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly conceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon—the moon itself in all its glory—lay beneath me, and at my feet.\n\n“The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite—or, more precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion—that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my apparatus.\n\n“It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart—and although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.\n\n“April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s apparent bulk—and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke’s comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun’s rays by the moon’s atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32° from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1″ or 2″ of time indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb.(*4)\n\n“Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air.\n\n“April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock, the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the car. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones.\n\n“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the private ear of the States’ College of Astronomers of far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I have much—very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water; of the people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth—a connection analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies—above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon—regions which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite’s rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God’s mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and more—much more—would I most willingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to my home; and as the price of any farther communication on my part—in consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science—I must solicit, through the influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your Excellencies’ pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be obtained.\n\n“I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble servant,\n\n“HANS PFAALL.”\n\nUpon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor Snickle, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise, and Reginald Thumble having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There was no doubt about the matter—the pardon should be obtained. So at least swore, with a round oath, Professor Snickle, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster’s dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear—no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam—the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let us see what they say:\n\nImprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.\n\nDon’t understand at all.\n\nSecondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.\n\nWell—what of that?\n\nThirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the moon. They were dirty papers—very dirty—and Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in Rotterdam.\n\nHe was mistaken—undoubtedly—mistaken.\n\nFourthly, That Lars Finkel himself, the drunken villain, and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea.\n\nDon’t believe it—don’t believe a word of it.\n\nLastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,—not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,—are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be.", "context_order": 4, "question": "What day did Hans Pfaall notice an enormous increase in the moon's apparent bulk and begin to feel alarmed by his accelerated descent?", "answer": "April 18th."}

The Horror in Clay.\n\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\n\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.\n\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death of my grand-uncle, Nathaniel Evert Thorn, Professor Emeritus of Semitic languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Thorn was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder.\n\nAs my granduncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published by the American Archeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing to other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most superficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.\n\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.\n\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.\n\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, in Professor Thorn's most recent hand; and made no pretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was headed \"CTHULHU CULT\" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which was headed \"1925—Dream and Dream Work of Roderick Lance Ilford, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.,\" and the second, \"Narrative of Inspector Felix Dolan, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg—Notes on Same, & Prof. Eldridge's Acct.\" The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W. Scott-Eliott's Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\n\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Thorn bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Roderick Lance Ilford, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Ilford was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\". Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\n\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology. Young Ilford's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \"It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\"\n\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Ilford's imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \"Cthulhu fhtagn\".\n\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Thorn. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his nightclothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Ilford afterward said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Ilford could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Thorn became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters \"Cthulhu\" and \"R'lyeh\".\n\nOn March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Ilford failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Barnett, whom he learned to be in charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Barnett, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\n\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p. m. every trace of Ilford's malady suddenly ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Thorn he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.\n\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Ilford had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and business—New England's traditional \"salt of the earth\"—gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23rd and April 2nd—the period of young Ilford's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.", "context_order": 0, "question": "What was Roderick Lance Ilford's profession or field of study?", "answer": "Sculpture."}

As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Ilford, somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Ilford had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Ilford's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.\n\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Thorn must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some \"glorious fulfilment\" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgies multiply in Haiti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22-23. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Ilford had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.\n\n2. The Tale of Inspector Dolan.\n\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Thorn had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as \"Cthulhu\"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued young Ilford with queries and demands for data.\n\nThis earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Thorn, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.\n\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was Inspector Felix Dolan, and he was by profession an inspector of police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine.\n\nIt must not be fancied that Inspector Dolan had the least interest in archeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.\n\nInspector Dolan was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.\n\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws which clasped the croucher's elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art belonging to civilization's youth—or indeed to any other time.\n\nTotally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.\n\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late Eldridge Thorne, professor of anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.\n\nProfessor Thorne had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Thorne had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.\n\nThese data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Dolan; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this—the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:\n\n\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\"\n\nDolan had one point in advance of Professor Thorne, for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:\n\n\"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"\n\nAnd now, in response to a general urgent demand, Inspector Dolan related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers; telling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savored of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.\n\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to New Orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.\n\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragments of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Dolan and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.\n\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in ", "context_order": 1, "question": "What phrase did both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests chant?", "answer": "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."}

They said it had been there before D'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents.\n\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Dolan's men as they plowed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to demoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the less organized ululations would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong chant that hideous phrase or ritual:\n\n\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\"\n\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Dolan dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized with horror.\n\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a center hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers jumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanale between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.\n\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Theo Ramirez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition.\n\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Dolan was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen. Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by Dolan.\n\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a coloring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprizing consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.\n\nThey worshiped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first man, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.\n\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The chant meant only this: \"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"\n\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by Black-winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Vargas, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of China.\n\nOld Vargas remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been eons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before man came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them.\n\nThese Great Old Ones, Vargas continued, were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by molding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.\n\nThen, whispered Vargas, those first men formed the cult around small idols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.\n\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then something had happened. The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth, moldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Vargas dared not speak much. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that he thought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Rashid Sahir which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\n\n\"That is not dead which can eternal lie,\nAnd with strange eons even death may die.\"\nDolan, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Vargas, apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Thorne.\n\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Dolan's tale, corroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended, although scant mention occurs in the formal publication of the society. Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Dolan for some time lent the image to Professor Thorne, but at the latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Ilford.\n\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Dolan had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Thorn's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Ilford of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Dolan, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.\n\nIlford still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian imitation of Seventeenth Century Breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely Colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, be heard from sometime as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which Edgar Malton evokes in prose, and Byron Evens makes visible in verse and in painting.\n\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosit", "context_order": 2, "question": "What did the cult worship according to the prisoners?", "answer": "They worshiped the Great Old Ones who came to the young world out of the sky."}

I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out.\n\nIn a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions.\n\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: \"Cthulhu fhtagn,\" \"Cthulhu fhtagn.\"\n\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Ilford, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises.\n\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections. I visited New Orleans, talked with Dolan and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Vargas, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so graphically at first hand, though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Thorn.\n\nOne thing which I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be surprized to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and beliefs. Dolan and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor Thorn died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\n\n3. The Madness from the Sea.\n\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.\n\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Thorn called the \"Cthulhu Cult,\" and was visiting a learned friend of Paterson, New Jersey, the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Dolan had found in the swamp.\n\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows:\n\nMYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\n\nVigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.\n\nThe Morrison Co.'s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21', W. Longitude 152° 17', with one living and one dead man aboard.\n\nThe Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2d was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week.\n\nThe living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.\n\nThis man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Lars Brannigan, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th, with a complement of eleven men.\n\nThe Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22d, in S. Latitude 49° 51´, W. Longitude 128° 34´, encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Hargrove refused; whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment.\n\nThe Emma's men showed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the savage crew on the yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.\n\nThree of the Emma's men, including Capt. Hargrove and First Mate Flinn, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Brannigan proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed.\n\nThe next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Brannigan is queerly reticent about this part of his story and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.\n\nLater, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd.\n\nFrom that time till his rescue on the 12th, the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when Derek Langley, his companion, died. Langley's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure.\n\nCable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st.\n\nOur Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Brannigan is described as a sober and worthy man.\n\nThe admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Brannigan to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.\n\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Brannigan was so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?\n\nMarch 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had molded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Ilford emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old Vargas about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind's soul.\n\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills.\n\nIn Auckland I learned that Brannigan had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address.\n\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material which I had noted in Dolan's smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what old Vargas had told Dolan about the primal Great Ones: \"They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.\"\n\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Brannigan in Oslo. Sailing for London, I re-embarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg.\n\nBrannigan's address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as \"Christiania.\" I made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front.

He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of \"technical matters\" as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.\n\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest; \"accidentally\" or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connection with her husband's \"technical matters\" was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat.\n\nIt was a simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary—and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to show why the sound of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.\n\nBrannigan, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favored by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.\n\nBrannigan's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Brannigan shows ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Brannigan's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9', W. Longitude 126° 43' come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, that was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Brannigan did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\n\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Brannigan and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons, and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate's frightened description.\n\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Brannigan achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on the broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Ilford had told me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.\n\nBrannigan and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.\n\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for some portable souvenir to bear away.\n\nIt was Morales the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Brannigan said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Ilford would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything else seemed fantasmally variable.\n\nLangley pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Freeman felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone molding—that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal—and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced.\n\nFreeman slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal. In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.\n\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its eon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membranous wings. The odor arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Barrett thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.\n\nPoor Brannigan's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing can not be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Ilford raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\n\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Freeman, Vasquez and Nordlund. Carver slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Brannigan swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Langley and Brannigan reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.\n\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheels and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Langley looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Brannigan was wandering deliriously.\n\nBut Brannigan had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a demon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Brannigan drove on relentlessly.\n\nThere was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.\n\nThat was all. After that Brannigan only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet's tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.\n\nOut of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\n\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Thorn. With it shall go this record of mine—this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Brannigan went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives.\n\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but I must not and can not think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.", "context_order": 4, "question": "What caused Brannigan's death after he returned?", "answer": "A bundle of papers falling from an attic window knocked him down, and he died before the ambulance could reach him."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Death of Ivan Ilich.txt", "context": "I\nDuring an interval in the Melvinski trial in the large building of the Law Courts the members and public prosecutor met in Adrian Kovalev’s private room, where the conversation turned on the celebrated Krasovski case. Andrei Kuznetsov warmly maintained that it was not subject to their jurisdiction, Ivan Egorovich maintained the contrary, while Dmitry Volkov, not having entered into the discussion at the start, took no part in it but looked through the *Gazette* which had just been handed in.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “Leonid Ivanovich has died!”\n\n“You don’t say so!”\n\n“Here, read it yourself,” replied Dmitry Volkov, handing Andrei Kuznetsov the paper still damp from the press. Surrounded by a black border were the words: “Elena Mikhailova, with profound sorrow, informs relatives and friends of the demise of her beloved husband Leonid Ivanovich Golovin, Member of the Court of Justice, which occurred on February the 4th of this year 1882. the funeral will take place on Friday at one o’clock in the afternoon.”\n\nLeonid Ivanovich had been a colleague of the gentlemen present and was liked by them all. He had been ill for some weeks with an illness said to be incurable. His post had been kept open for him, but there had been conjectures that in case of his death Grigory Morozov might receive his appointment, and that either Yuri Ivanov or Anton Pavlov would succeed Grigory Morozov. So on receiving the news of Leonid Ivanovich’s death the first thought of each of the gentlemen in that private room was of the changes and promotions it might occasion among themselves or their acquaintances.\n\n“I shall be sure to get Anton Pavlov’s place or Yuri Ivanov’s,” thought Andrei Kuznetsov. “I was promised that long ago, and the promotion means an extra eight hundred rubles a year for me besides the allowance.”\n\n“Now I must apply for my brother-in-law’s transfer from Kaluga,” thought Dmitry Volkov. “My wife will be very glad, and then she won’t be able to say that I never do anything for her relations.”\n\n“I thought he would never leave his bed again,” said Dmitry Volkov aloud. “It’s very sad.”\n\n“But what really was the matter with him?”\n\n“The doctors couldn’t say — at least they could, but each of them said something different. When last I saw him I thought he was getting better.”\n\n“And I haven’t been to see him since the holidays. I always meant to go.”\n\n“Had he any property?”\n\n“I think his wife had a little — but something quiet trifling.”\n\n“We shall have to go to see her, but they live so terribly far away.”\n\n“Far away from you, you mean. Everything’s far away from your place.”\n\n“You see, he never can forgive my living on the other side of the river,” said Dmitry Volkov, smiling at Adrian Kovalev. Then, still talking of the distances between different parts of the city, they returned to the Court.\n\nBesides considerations as to the possible transfers and promotions likely to result from Leonid Ivanovich’s death, the mere fact of the death of a near acquaintance aroused, as usual, in all who heard of it the complacent feeling that, “it is he who is dead and not I.”\n\nEach one thought or felt, “Well, he’s dead but I’m alive!” But the more intimate of Leonid Ivanovich’s acquaintances, his so-called friends, could not help thinking also that they would now have to fulfil the very tiresome demands of propriety by attending the funeral service and paying a visit of condolence to the widow.\n\nAndrei Kuznetsov and Dmitry Volkov had been his nearest acquaintances. Dmitry Volkov had studied law with Leonid Ivanovich and had considered himself to be under obligations to him.\n\nHaving told his wife at dinner-time of Leonid Ivanovich’s death, and of his conjecture that it might be possible to get her brother transferred to their circuit, Dmitry Volkov sacrificed his usual nap, put on his evening clothes and drove to Leonid Ivanovich’s house.\n\nAt the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs. Leaning against the wall in the hall downstairs near the cloakstand was a coffin-lid covered with cloth of gold, ornamented with gold cord and tassels, that had been polished up with metal powder. Two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks. Dmitry Volkov recognized one of them as Leonid Ivanovich’s sister, but the other was a stranger to him. His colleague Roman Belov was just coming downstairs, but on seeing Dmitry Volkov enter he stopped and winked at him, as if to say: “Leonid Ivanovich has made a mess of things — not like you and me.”\n\nRoman Belov’s face with his Piccadilly whiskers, and his slim figure in evening dress, had as usual an air of elegant solemnity which contrasted with the playfulness of his character and had a special piquancy here, or so it seemed to Dmitry Volkov.\n\nDmitry Volkov allowed the ladies to precede him and slowly followed them upstairs. Roman Belov did not come down but remained where he was, and Dmitry Volkov understood that he wanted to arrange where they should play bridge that evening. The ladies went upstairs to the widow’s room, and Roman Belov with seriously compressed lips but a playful look in his eyes, indicated by a twist of his eyebrows the room to the right where the body lay.\n\nDmitry Volkov, like everyone else on such occasions, entered feeling uncertain what he would have to do. All he knew was that at such times it is always safe to cross oneself. But he was not quite sure whether one should make obseisances while doing so. He therefore adopted a middle course. On entering the room he began crossing himself and made a slight movement resembling a bow. At the same time, as far as the motion of his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the room. Two young men — apparently nephews, one of whom was a high-school pupil — were leaving the room, crossing themselves as they did so. An old woman was standing motionless, and a lady with strangely arched eyebrows was saying something to her in a whisper. A vigorous, resolute Church Reader, in a frock- coat, was reading something in a loud voice with an expression that precluded any contradiction. The butler’s assistant, Nikolai Petrov, stepping lightly in front of Dmitry Volkov, was strewing something on the floor. Noticing this, Dmitry Volkov was immediately aware of a faint odour of a decomposing body.\n\nThe last time he had called on Leonid Ivanovich, Dmitry Volkov had seen Nikolai Petrov in the study. Leonid Ivanovich had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the duty of a sick nurse.\n\nDmitry Volkov continued to make the sign of the cross slightly inclining his head in an intermediate direction between the coffin, the Reader, and the icons on the table in a corner of the room. Afterwards, when it seemed to him that this movement of his arm in crossing himself had gone on too long, he stopped and began to look at the corpse.\n\nThe dead man lay, as dead men always lie, in a specially heavy way, his rigid limbs sunk in the soft cushions of the coffin, with the head forever bowed on the pillow. His yellow waxen brow with bald patches over his sunken temples was thrust up in the way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose seeming to press on the upper lip. He was much changed and grown even thinner since Dmitry Volkov had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive. The expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, and accomplished rightly. Besides this there was in that expression a reproach and a warning to the living. This warning seemed to Dmitry Volkov out of place, or at least not applicable to him. He felt a certain discomfort and so he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door — too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware.\n\nRoman Belov was waiting for him in the adjoining room with legs spread wide apart and both hands toying with his top-hat behind his back. The mere sight of that playful, well-groomed, and elegant figure refreshed Dmitry Volkov. He felt that Roman Belov was above all these happenings and would not surrender to any depressing influences. His very look said that this incident of a church service for Leonid Ivanovich could not be a sufficient reason for infringing the order of the session — in other words, that it would certainly not prevent his unwrapping a new pack of cards and shuffling them that evening while a footman placed fresh candles on the table: in fact, that there was no reason for supposing that this incident would hinder their spending the evening agreeably. Indeed he said this in a whisper as Dmitry Volkov passed him, proposing that they should meet for a game at Andrei Kuznetsov’s. But apparently Dmitry Volkov was not destined to play bridge that evening. Elena Mikhailova (a short, fat woman who despite all efforts to the contrary had continued to broaden steadily from her shoulders downwards and who had the same extraordinarily arched eyebrows as the lady who had been standing by the coffin), dressed all in black, her head covered with lace, came out of her own room with some other ladies, conducted them to the room where the dead body lay, and said: “The service will begin immediately. Please go in.”\n\nRoman Belov, making an indefinite bow, stood still, evidently neither accepting nor declining this invitation. Elena Mikhailova recognizing Dmitry Volkov, sighed, went close up to him, took his hand, and said: “I know you were a true friend to Leonid Ivanovich…” and looked at him awaiting some suitable response. And Dmitry Volkov knew that, just as it had been the right thing to cross himself in that room, so what he had to do here was to press her hand, sigh, and say, “Believe me…” So he did all this and as he did it felt that the desired result had been achieved: that both he and she were touched.\n\n“Come with me. I want to speak to you before it begins,” said the widow. “Give me your arm.”\n\nDmitry Volkov gave her his arm and they went to the inner rooms, passing Roman Belov who winked at Dmitry Volkov compassionately.\n\n“That does for our bridge! Don’t object if we find another player. Perhaps you can cut in when you do escape,” said his playful look.\n\nDmitry Volkov sighed still more deeply and despondently, and Elena Mikhailova pressed his arm gratefully. When they reached the drawing-room, upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp, they sat down at the table — she on a sofa and Dmitry Volkov on a low pouffe, the springs of which yielded spasmodically under his weight. Elena Mikhailova had been on the point of warning him to take another seat, but felt that such a warning was out of keeping with her present condition and so changed her mind. As he sat down on the pouffe Dmitry Volkov recalled how Leonid Ivanovich had arranged this room and had consulted him regarding this pink cretonne with green leaves. The whole room was full of furniture and knick-knacks, and on her way to the sofa the lace of the widow’s black shawl caught on the edge of the table. Dmitry Volkov rose to detach it, and the springs of the pouffe, relieved of his weight, rose also and gave him a push. The widow began detaching her shawl herself, and Dmitry Volkov again sat down, suppressing the rebellious springs of the pouffe under him. But the widow had not quite freed herself and Dmitry Volkov got up again, and again the pouffe rebelled and even creaked. When this was all over she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to weep. The episode with the shawl and the struggle with the pouffe had cooled Dmitry Volkov’s emotions and he sat there with a sullen look on his face. This awkward situation was interrupted by Sergey Burkov, Leonid Ivanovich’s butler, who came to report that the plot in the cemetery that Elena Mikhailova had chosen would cost two hundred rubles. She stopped weeping and, looking at Dmitry Volkov with the air of a victim, remarked in French that it was very hard for her. Dmitry Volkov made a silent gesture signifying his full conviction that it must indeed be so.\n\n“Please smoke,” she said in a magnanimous yet crushed voice, and turned to discuss with Sergey Burkov the price of the plot for the grave.\n\nDmitry Volkov while lighting his cigarette heard her inquiring very circumstantially into the prices of different plots in the cemetery and finally decide which she would take. when that was done she gave instructions about engaging the choir. Sergey Burkov then left the room.\n\n“I look after everything myself,” she told Dmitry Volkov, shifting the albums that lay on the table; and noticing that the table was endangered by his cigarette-ash, she immediately passed him an ash-tray, saying as she did so: “I consider it an affectation to say that my grief prevents my attending to practical affairs. On the contrary, if anything can — I won’t say console me, but — distract me, it is seeing to everything concerning him.” She again took out her handkerchief as if preparing to cry, but suddenly, as if mastering her feeling, she shook herself and began to speak calmly. “But there is something I want to talk to you about.”\n\nDmitry Volkov bowed, keeping control of the springs of the pouffe, which immediately began quivering under him.\n\n“He suffered terribly the last few days.”\n\n“Did he?” said Dmitry Volkov.\n\n“Oh, terribly! He screamed unceasingly, not for minutes but for hours. for the last three days he screamed incessantly. It was unendurable. I cannot understand how I bore it; you could hear him three rooms off. Oh, what I have suffered!”\n\n“Is it possible that he was conscious all that time?” asked Dmitry Volkov.\n\n“Yes,” she whispered. “To the last moment. He took leave of us a quarter of an hour before he died, and asked us to take Vlad away.”\n\nThe thought of the suffering of this man he had known so intimately, first as a merry little boy, then as a schoolmate, and later as a grown-up colleague, suddenly struck Dmitry Volkov with horror, despite an unpleasant consciousness of his own and this woman’s dissimulation. He again saw that brow, and that nose pressing down on the lip, and felt afraid for himself.\n\n“Three days of frightful suffering and the death! Why, that might suddenly, at any time, happen to me,” he thought, and for a moment felt terrified. But — he did not himself know how — the customary reflection at once occurred to him that this had happened to Leonid Ivanovich and not to him, and that it should not and could not happen to him, and that to think that it could would be yielding to depression which he ought not to do, as Roman Belov’s expression plainly showed. After which reflection Dmitry Volkov felt reassured, and began to ask with interest about the details of Leonid Ivanovich’s death, as though death was an accident natural to Leonid Ivanovich but certainly not to himself.\n\nAfter many details of the really dreadful physical sufferings Leonid Ivanovich had endured (which details he learnt only from the effect those sufferings had produced on Elena Mikhailova’s nerves) the widow apparently found it necessary to get to business.\n\n“Oh, Dmitry Volkov, how hard it is! How terribly, terribly hard!” and she again began to weep.\n\nDmitry Volkov sighed and waited for her to finish blowing her nose. When she had don so he said, “Believe me…” and she again began talking and brought out what was evidently her chief concern with him — namely, to question him as to how she could obtain a grant of money from the government on the occasion of her husband’s death. She made it appear that she was asking Dmitry Volkov’s advice about her pension, but he soon saw that she already knew about that to the minutest detail, more even than he did himself. She knew how much could be got out of the government in consequence of her husband’s death, but wanted to find out whether she could not possibly extract something more. Dmitry Volkov tried to think of some means of doing so, but after reflecting for a while and, out of propriety, condemning the government for its niggardliness, he said he thought that nothing more could be got. Then she sighed and evidently began to devise means of getting rid of her visitor. Noticing this, he put out his cigarette, rose, pressed her hand, and went out into the anteroom.\n\nIn the dining-room where the clock stood that Leonid Ivanovich had liked so much and had bought at an antique shop, Dmitry Volkov met a priest and a few acquaintances who had come to attend the service, and he recognized Leonid Ivanovich’s daughter, a handsome young woman. She was in black and her slim figure appeared slimmer than ever. She had a gloomy, determined, almost angry expression, and bowed to Dmitry Volkov as though he were in some way to blame. Behind her, with the same offended look, stood a wealthy young man, and examining magistrate, whom Dmitry Volkov also knew and who was her fiance, as he had heard. He bowed mournfully to them and was about to pass into the death-chamber, when from under the stairs appeared the figure of Leonid Ivanovich’s schoolboy son, who was extremely like his father. He seemed a little Leonid Ivanovich, such as Dmitry Volkov remembered when they studied law together. His tear-stained eyes had in them the look that is seen in the eyes of boys of thirteen or fourteen who are not pure-minded. When he saw Dmitry Volkov he scowled morosely and shamefacedly. Dmitry Volkov nodded to him and entered the death-chamber. The service began: candles, groans, incense, tears, and sobs. Dmitry Volkov stood looking gloomily down at his feet. He did not look once at the dead man, did not yield to any depressing influence, and was one of the first to leave the room. There was no one in the anteroom, but Nikolai Petrov darted out of the dead man’s room, rummaged with his strong hands among the fur coats to find Dmitry Volkov’s and helped him on with it.\n\n“Well, friend Nikolai Petrov,” said Dmitry Volkov, so as to say something. “It’s a sad affair, isn’t it?”\n\n“It’s God will. We shall all come to it some day,” said Nikolai Petrov, displaying his teeth — the even white teeth of a healthy peasant — and, like a man in the thick of urgent work, he briskly opened the front door, called the coachman, helped Dmitry Volkov into the sledge, and sprang back to the porch as if in readiness for what he had to do next.\n\nDmitry Volkov found the fresh air particularly pleasant after the smell of incense, the dead body, and carbolic acid.\n\n“Where to sir?” asked the coachman.\n\n“It’s not too late even now….I’ll call round on Andrei Kuznetsov.”\n\nHe accordingly drove there and found them just finishing the first rubber, so that it was quite convenient for him to cut in.\n\nII\nLeonid Ivanovich’s life had been most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible.\n\nHe had been a member of the Court of Justice, and died at the age of forty-five. His father had been an official who after serving in various ministries and departments in Dmitrysburg had made the sort of career which brings men to positions from which by reason of their long service they cannot be dismissed, though they are obviously unfit to hold any responsible position, and for whom therefore posts are specially created, which though fictitious carry salaries of from six to ten thousand rubles that are not fictitious, and in receipt of which they live on to a great age.\n\nSuch was the Privy Councillor and superfluous member of various superfluous institutions, Oleg Titov.\n\nHe had three sons, of whom Leonid Ivanovich was the second. The eldest son was following in his father’s footsteps only in another department, and was already approaching that stage in the service at which a similar sinecure would be reached. The third son was a failure. He had ruined his prospects in a number of positions and was now serving in the railway department. His father and brothers, and still more their wives, not merely disliked meeting him, but avoided remembering his existence unless compelled to do so. His sister had married Baron Karpin, a Dmitrysburg official of her father’s type. Leonid Ivanovich was le phе́nix de la famille as people said. He was neither as cold and formal as his elder brother nor as wild as the younger, but was a happy mean between them — an intelligent polished, lively and agreeable man. He had studied with his younger brother at the School of Law, but the latter had failed to complete the course and was expelled when he was in the fifth class. Leonid Ivanovich finished the course well. Even when he was at the School of Law he was just what he remained for the rest of his life: a capable, cheerful, good-natured, and sociable man, though strict in the fulfillment of what he considered to be his duty: and he considered his duty to be what was so considered by those in authority. Neither as a boy nor as a man was he a toady, but from early youth was by nature attracted to people of high station as a fly is drawn to the light, assimilating their ways and views of life and establishing friendly relations with them. All the enthusiasms of childhood and youth passed without leaving much trace on him; he succumbed to sensuality, to vanity, and finally, in the upper classes, to liberalism, but always within limits which his instinct unfailingly indicated to him as correct.\n\nAt school he had done things which had formerly seemed to him very horrid and made him feel disgusted with himself when he did them; but when later on he saw that such actions were done by people of good position and that they did not regard them as wrong, he was able not exactly to regard them as right, but to forget about them entirely or not be at all troubled at remembering them.\n\nHaving graduated from the School of Law and qualified for the tenth rank of the civil service, and having received money from his father for his equipment, Leonid Ivanovich ordered himself clothes at Scharmer’s, the fashionable tailor, hung a medallion inscribed respice finem on his watch-chain, took leave of his professor and the prince who was patron of the school, had a farewell dinner with his comrades at Donon’s first-class restaurant, and with his new and fashionable portmanteau, linen, clothes, shaving and other toilet appliances, and a travelling rug, all purchased at the best shops, he set off for one of the provinces where through his father’s influence, he had been attached to the governor as an official for special service.\n\nIn the province Leonid Ivanovich soon arranged as easy and agreeable a position for himself as he had had at the School of Law. He performed his official task, made his career, and at the same time amused himself pleasantly and decorously. Occasionally he paid official visits to country districts where he behaved with dignity both to his superiors and inferiors, and performed the duties entrusted to him, which related chiefly to the sectarians, with an exactness and incorruptible honesty of which he could not but feel proud.\n\nIn official matters, despite his youth and taste for frivolous gaiety, he was exceedingly reserved, punctilious, and even severe; but in society he was often amusing and witty, and always good- natured, correct in his manner, and bon enfant, as the governor and his wife — with whom he was like one of the family — used to say of him.\n\nIn the province he had an affair with a lady who made advances to the elegant young lawyer, and there was also a milliner; and there were carousals with aides-de-camp who visited the district, and after-supper visits to a certain outlying street of doubtful reputation; and there was too some obsequiousness to his chief and even to his chief’s wife, but all this was done with such a tone of good breeding that no hard names could be applied to it. It all came under the heading of the French saying: Il faut que jeunesse se passe. It was all done with clean hands, in clean linen, with French phrases, and above all among people of the best society and consequently with the approval of people of rank.\n\nSo Leonid Ivanovich served for five years and then came a change in his official life. The new and reformed judicial institutions were introduced, and new men were needed. Leonid Ivanovich became such a new man. He was offered the post of examining magistrate, and he accepted it though the post was in another province and obliged him to give up the connexions he had formed and to make new ones. His friends met to give him a send-off; they had a group photograph taken and presented him with a silver cigarette-case, and he set off to his new post.\n\nAs examining magistrate Leonid Ivanovich was just as comme il faut and decorous a man, inspiring general respect and capable of separating his official duties from his private life, as he had been when acting as an official on special service. His duties now as examining magistrate were far more interesting and attractive than before. In his former position it had been pleasant to wear an undress uniform made by Scharmer, and to pass through the crowd of petitioners and officials who were timorously awaiting an audience with the governor, and who envied him as with free and easy gait he went straight into his chief’s private room to have a cup of tea and a cigarette with him. But not many people had then been directly dependent on him — only police officials and the sectarians when he went on special missions — and he liked to treat them politely, almost as c", "context_order": 0, "question": "What is the name of Leonid Ivanovich's butler's assistant, who helped during his illness and at the funeral?", "answer": "Nikolai Petrov."}

There were then but few such people. But now, as an examining magistrate, Leonid Ivanovich felt that everyone without exception, even the most important and self-satisfied, was in his power, and that he need only write a few words on a sheet of paper with a certain heading, and this or that important, self-satisfied person would be brought before him in the role of an accused person or a witness, and if he did not choose to allow him to sit down, would have to stand before him and answer his questions. Leonid Ivanovich never abused his power; he tried on the contrary to soften its expression, but the consciousness of it and the possibility of softening its effect, supplied the chief interest and attraction of his office. In his work itself, especially in his examinations, he very soon acquired a method of eliminating all considerations irrelevant to the legal aspect of the case, and reducing even the most complicated case to a form in which it would be presented on paper only in its externals, completely excluding his personal opinion of the matter, while above all observing every prescribed formality. The work was new and Leonid Ivanovich was one of the first men to apply the new Code of 1864.\n\nOn taking up the post of examining magistrate in a new town, he made new acquaintances and connexions, placed himself on a new footing and assumed a somewhat different tone. He took up an attitude of rather dignified aloofness towards the provincial authorities, but picked out the best circle of legal gentlemen and wealthy gentry living in the town and assumed a tone of slight dissatisfaction with the government, of moderate liberalism, and of enlightened citizenship. At the same time, without at all altering the elegance of his toilet, he ceased shaving his chin and allowed his beard to grow as it pleased.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich settled down very pleasantly in this new town. The society there, which inclined towards opposition to the governor was friendly, his salary was larger, and he began to play whist, which he found added not a little to the pleasure of life, for he had a capacity for cards, played good-humouredly, and calculated rapidly and astutely, so that he usually won.\n\nAfter living there for two years he met his future wife, Elena Mikhailova, who was the most attractive, clever, and brilliant girl of the set in which he moved, and among other amusements and relaxations from his labours as examining magistrate, Leonid Ivanovich established light and playful relations with her.\n\nWhile he had been an official on special service he had been accustomed to dance, but now as an examining magistrate it was exceptional for him to do so. If he danced now, he did it as if to show that though he served under the reformed order of things, and had reached the fifth official rank, yet when it came to dancing he could do it better than most people. So at the end of an evening he sometimes danced with Elena Mikhailova, and it was chiefly during these dances that he captivated her. She fell in love with him. Leonid Ivanovich had at first no definite intention of marrying, but when the girl fell in love with him he said to himself: “Really, why shouldn’t I marry?”\n\nElena Mikhailova came of a good family, was not bad looking, and had some little property. Leonid Ivanovich might have aspired to a more brilliant match, but even this was good. He had his salary, and she, he hoped, would have an equal income. She was well connected, and was a sweet, pretty, and thoroughly correct young woman. To say that Leonid Ivanovich married because he fell in love with Elena Mikhailova and found that she sympathized with his views of life would be as incorrect as to say that he married because his social circle approved of the match. He was swayed by both these considerations: the marriage gave him personal satisfaction, and at the same time it was considered the right thing by the most highly placed of his associates.\n\nSo Leonid Ivanovich got married.\n\nThe preparations for marriage and the beginning of married life, with its conjugal caresses, the new furniture, new crockery, and new linen, were very pleasant until his wife became pregnant — so that Leonid Ivanovich had begun to think that marriage would not impair the easy, agreeable, gay and always decorous character of his life, approved of by society and regarded by himself as natural, but would even improve it. But from the first months of his wife’s pregnancy, something new, unpleasant, depressing, and unseemly, and from which there was no way of escape, unexpectedly showed itself.\n\nHis wife, without any reason — de gaieté de coeur as Leonid Ivanovich expressed it to himself — began to disturb the pleasure and propriety of their life. She began to be jealous without any cause, expected him to devote his whole attention to her, found fault with everything, and made coarse and ill-mannered scenes.\n\nAt first Leonid Ivanovich hoped to escape from the unpleasantness of this state of affairs by the same easy and decorous relation to life that had served him heretofore: he tried to ignore his wife’s disagreeable moods, continued to live in his usual easy and pleasant way, invited friends to his house for a game of cards, and also tried going out to his club or spending his evenings with friends. But one day his wife began upbraiding him so vigorously, using such coarse words, and continued to abuse him every time he did not fulfil her demands, so resolutely and with such evident determination not to give way till he submitted — that is, till he stayed at home and was bored just as she was — that he became alarmed. He now realized that matrimony — at any rate with Elena Mikhailova — was not always conducive to the pleasures and amenities of life, but on the contrary often infringed both comfort and propriety, and that he must therefore entrench himself against such infringement. And Leonid Ivanovich began to seek for means of doing so. His official duties were the one thing that imposed upon Elena Mikhailova, and by means of his official work and the duties attached to it he began struggling with his wife to secure his own independence.\n\nWith the birth of their child, the attempts to feed it and the various failures in doing so, and with the real and imaginary illnesses of mother and child, in which Leonid Ivanovich’s sympathy was demanded but about which he understood nothing, the need of securing for himself an existence outside his family life became still more imperative.\n\nAs his wife grew more irritable and exacting and Leonid Ivanovich transferred the center of gravity of his life more and more to his official work, so did he grow to like his work better and became more ambitious than before.\n\nVery soon, within a year of his wedding, Leonid Ivanovich had realized that marriage, though it may add some comforts to life, is in fact a very intricate and difficult affair towards which in order to perform one’s duty, that is, to lead a decorous life approved of by society, one must adopt a definite attitude just as towards one’s official duties.\n\nAnd Leonid Ivanovich evolved such an attitude towards married life. He only required of it those conveniences — dinner at home, housewife, and bed — which it could give him, and above all that propriety of external forms required by public opinion. For the rest he looked for lighthearted pleasure and propriety, and was very thankful when he found them, but if he met with antagonism and querulousness he at once retired into his separate fenced-off world of official duties, where he found satisfaction.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich was esteemed a good official, and after three years was made Assistant Public Prosecutor. His new duties, their importance, the possibility of indicting and imprisoning anyone he chose, the publicity his speeches received, and the success he had in all these things, made his work still more attractive.\n\nMore children came. His wife became more and more querulous and ill-tempered, but the attitude Leonid Ivanovich had adopted towards his home life rendered him almost impervious to her grumbling.\n\nAfter seven years’ service in that town he was transferred to another province as Public Prosecutor. They moved, but were short of money and his wife did not like the place they moved to. Though the salary was higher the cost of living was greater, besides which two of their children died and family life became still more unpleasant for him.\n\nElena Mikhailova blamed her husband for every inconvenience they encountered in their new home. Most of the conversations between husband and wife, especially as to the children’s education, led to topics which recalled former disputes, and these disputes were apt to flare up again at any moment. There remained only those rare periods of amorousness which still came to them at times but did not last long. These were islets at which they anchored for a while and then again set out upon that ocean of veiled hostility which showed itself in their aloofness from one another. This aloofness might have grieved Leonid Ivanovich had he considered that it ought not to exist, but he now regarded the position as normal, and even made it the goal at which he aimed in family life. His aim was to free himself more and more from those unpleasantnesses and to give them a semblance of harmlessness and propriety. He attained this by spending less and less time with his family, and when obliged to be at home he tried to safeguard his position by the presence of outsiders. The chief thing however was that he had his official duties. The whole interest of his life now centered in the official world and that interest absorbed him. The consciousness of his power, being able to ruin anybody he wished to ruin, the importance, even the external dignity of his entry into court, or meetings with his subordinates, his success with superiors and inferiors, and above all his masterly handling of cases, of which he was conscious — all this gave him pleasure and filled his life, together with chats with his colleagues, dinners, and bridge. So that on the whole Leonid Ivanovich’s life continued to flow as he considered it should do — pleasantly and properly.\n\nSo things continued for another seven years. His eldest daughter was already sixteen, another child had died, and only one son was left, a schoolboy and a subject of dissension. Leonid Ivanovich wanted to put him in the School of Law, but to spite him Elena Mikhailova entered him at the High School. The daughter had been educated at home and had turned out well: the boy did not learn badly either.\n\nIII\nSo Leonid Ivanovich lived for seventeen years after his marriage. He was already a Public Prosecutor of long standing, and had declined several proposed transfers while awaiting a more desirable post, when an unanticipated and unpleasant occurrence quite upset the peaceful course of his life. He was expecting to be offered the post of presiding judge in a University town, but Igor Panin somehow came to the front and obtained the appointment instead. Leonid Ivanovich became irritable, reproached Igor Panin, and quarrelled both with him and with his immediate superiors — who became colder to him and again passed him over when other appointments were made.\n\nThis was in 1880, the hardest year of Leonid Ivanovich’s life. It was then that it became evident on the one hand that his salary was insufficient for them to live on, and on the other that he had been forgotten, and not only this, but that what was for him the greatest and most cruel injustice appeared to others a quite ordinary occurrence. Even his father did not consider it his duty to help him. Leonid Ivanovich felt himself abandoned by everyone, and that they regarded his position with a salary of 3,500 rubles as quite normal and even fortunate. He alone knew that with the consciousness of the injustices done him, with his wife’s incessant nagging, and with the debts he had contracted by living beyond his means, his position was far from normal.\n\nIn order to save money that summer he obtained leave of absence and went with his wife to live in the country at her brother’s place.\n\nIn the country, without his work, he experienced ennui for the first time in his life, and not only ennui but intolerable depression, and he decided that it was impossible to go on living like that, and that it was necessary to take energetic measures.\n\nHaving passed a sleepless night pacing up and down the veranda, he decided to go to Dmitrysburg and bestir himself, in order to punish those who had failed to appreciate him and to get transferred to another ministry.\n\nNext day, despite many protests from his wife and her brother, he started for Dmitrysburg with the sole object of obtaining a post with a salary of five thousand rubles a year. He was no longer bent on any particular department, or tendency, or kind of activity. All he now wanted was an appointment to another post with a salary of five thousand rubles, either in the administration, in the banks, with the railways, in one of the Empress Marya’s Institutions, or even in the customs — but it had to carry with it a salary of five thousand rubles and be in a ministry other than that in which they had failed to appreciate him.\n\nAnd this quest of Leonid Ivanovich’s was crowned with remarkable and unexpected success. At Kursk an acquaintance of his, Victor Lobov, got into the first-class carriage, sat down beside Leonid Ivanovich, and told him of a telegram just received by the governor of Kursk announcing that a change was about to take place in the ministry: Dmitry Volkov was to be superseded by Pavel Semyonov.\n\nThe proposed change, apart from its significance for Russia, had a special significance for Leonid Ivanovich, because by bringing forward a new man, Nikita Vlasov, and consequently his friend Igor Rybakov, it was highly favourable for Leonid Ivanovich, since Igor Rybakov was a friend and colleague of his.\n\nIn Moscow this news was confirmed, and on reaching Dmitrysburg Leonid Ivanovich found Igor Rybakov and received a definite promise of an appointment in his former Department of Justice.\n\nA week later he telegraphed to his wife: “Zakhar in Miller’s place. I shall receive appointment on presentation of report.”\n\nThanks to this change of personnel, Leonid Ivanovich had unexpectedly obtained an appointment in his former ministry which placed him two states above his former colleagues besides giving him five thousand rubles salary and three thousand five hundred rubles for expenses connected with his removal. All his ill humour towards his former enemies and the whole department vanished, and Leonid Ivanovich was completely happy.\n\nHe returned to the country more cheerful and contented than he had been for a long time. Elena Mikhailova also cheered up and a truce was arranged between them. Leonid Ivanovich told of how he had been feted by everybody in Dmitrysburg, how all those who had been his enemies were put to shame and now fawned on him, how envious they were of his appointment, and how much everybody in Dmitrysburg had liked him.\n\nElena Mikhailova listened to all this and appeared to believe it. She did not contradict anything, but only made plans for their life in the town to which they were going. Leonid Ivanovich saw with delight that these plans were his plans, that he and his wife agreed, and that, after a stumble, his life was regaining its due and natural character of pleasant lightheartedness and decorum.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich had come back for a short time only, for he had to take up his new duties on the 10th of September. Moreover, he needed time to settle into the new place, to move all his belongings from the province, and to buy and order many additional things: in a word, to make such arrangements as he had resolved on, which were almost exactly what Elena Mikhailova too had decided on.\n\nNow that everything had happened so fortunately, and that he and his wife were at one in their aims and moreover saw so little of one another, they got on together better than they had done since the first years of marriage. Leonid Ivanovich had thought of taking his family away with him at once, but the insistence of his wife’s brother and her sister-in-law, who had suddenly become particularly amiable and friendly to him and his family, induced him to depart alone.\n\nSo he departed, and the cheerful state of mind induced by his success and by the harmony between his wife and himself, the one intensifying the other, did not leave him. He found a delightful house, just the thing both he and his wife had dreamt of. Spacious, lofty reception rooms in the old style, a convenient and dignified study, rooms for his wife and daughter, a study for his son — it might have been specially built for them. Leonid Ivanovich himself superintended the arrangements, chose the wallpapers, supplemented the furniture (preferably with antiques which he considered particularly comme il faut), and supervised the upholstering. Everything progressed and progressed and approached the ideal he had set himself: even when things were only half completed they exceeded his expectations. He saw what a refined and elegant character, free from vulgarity, it would all have when it was ready. On falling asleep he pictured to himself how the reception room would look. Looking at the yet unfinished drawing room he could see the fireplace, the screen, the what-not cabinet, the little chairs dotted here and there, the dishes and plates on the walls, and the bronzes, as they would be when everything was in place. He was pleased by the thought of how his wife and daughter, who shared his taste n this matter, would be impressed by it. They were certainly not expecting as much. He had been particularly successful in finding, and buying cheaply, antiques which gave a particularly aristocratic character to the whole place. But in his letters he intentionally understated everything in order to be able to surprise them. All this so absorbed him that his new duties — though he liked his official work — interested him less than he had expected. Sometimes he even had moments of absent-mindedness during the court sessions and would consider whether he should have straight or curved cornices for his curtains. He was so interested in it all that he often did things himself, rearranging the furniture, or rehanging the curtains. Once when mounting a step-ladder to show the upholsterer, who did not understand, how he wanted the hangings draped, he mad a false step and slipped, but being a strong and agile man he clung on and only knocked his side against the knob of the window frame. The bruised place was painful but the pain soon passed, and he felt particularly bright and well just then. He wrote: “I feel fifteen years younger.” He thought he would have everything ready by September, but it dragged on till mid-October. But the result was charming not only in his eyes but to everyone who saw it.\n\nIn reality it was just what is usually seen in the houses of people of moderate means who want to appear rich, and therefore succeed only in resembling others like themselves: there are damasks, dark wood, plants, rugs, and dull and polished bronzes — all the things people of a certain class have in order to resemble other people of that class. His house was so like the others that it would never have been noticed, but to him it all seemed to be quite exceptional. He was very happy when he met his family at the station and brought them to the newly furnished house all lit up, where a footman in a white tie opened the door into the hall decorated with plants, and when they went on into the drawing-room and the study uttering exclamations of delight. He conducted them everywhere, drank in their praises eagerly, and beamed with pleasure. At tea that evening, when Elena Mikhailova among others things asked him about his fall, he laughed, and showed them how he had gone flying and had frightened the upholsterer.\n\n“It’s a good thing I’m a bit of an athlete. Another man might have been killed, but I merely knocked myself, just here; it hurts when it’s touched, but it’s passing off already — it’s only a bruise.”\n\nSo they began living in their new home — in which, as always happens, when they got thoroughly settled in they found they were just one room short — and with the increased income, which as always was just a little (some five hundred rubles) too little, but it was all very nice.\n\nThings went particularly well at first, before everything was finally arranged and while something had still to be done: this thing bought, that thing ordered, another thing moved, and something else adjusted. Though there were some disputes between husband and wife, they were both so well satisfied and had so much to do that it all passed off without any serious quarrels. When nothing was left to arrange it became rather dull and something seemed to be lacking, but they were then making acquaintances, forming habits, and life was growing fuller.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich spent his mornings at the law court and came home to diner, and at first he was generally in a good humour, though he occasionally became irritable just on account of his house. (Every spot on the tablecloth or the upholstery, and every broken window- blind string, irritated him. He had devoted so much trouble to arranging it all that every disturbance of it distressed him.) But on the whole his life ran its course as he believed life should do: easily, pleasantly, and decorously.\n\nHe got up at nine, drank his coffee, read the paper, and then put on his undress uniform and went to the law courts. There the harness in which he worked had already been stretched to fit him and he donned it without a hitch: petitioners, inquiries at the chancery, the chancery itself, and the sittings public and administrative. In all this the thing was to exclude everything fresh and vital, which always disturbs the regular course of official business, and to admit only official relations with people, and then only on official grounds. A man would come, for instance, wanting some information. Leonid Ivanovich, as one in whose sphere the matter did not lie, would have nothing to do with him: but if the man had some business with him in his official capacity, something that could be expressed on officially stamped paper, he would do everything, positively everything he could within the limits of such relations, and in doing so would maintain the semblance of friendly human relations, that is, would observe the courtesies of life. As soon as the official relations ended, so did everything else. Leonid Ivanovich possessed this capacity to separate his real life from the official side of affairs and not mix the two, in the highest degree, and by long practice and natural aptitude had brought it to such a pitch that sometimes, in the manner of a virtuoso, he would even allow himself to let the human and official relations mingle. He let himself do this just because he felt that he could at any time he chose resume the strictly official attitude again and drop the human relation. and he did it all easily, pleasantly, correctly, and even artistically. In the intervals between the sessions he smoked, drank tea, chatted a little about politics, a little about general topics, a little about cards, but most of all about official appointments. Tired, but with the feelings of a virtuoso — one of the first violins who has played his part in an orchestra with precision — he would return home to find that his wife and daughter had been out paying calls, or had a visitor, and that his son had been to school, had done his homework with his tutor, and was surely learning what is taught at High Schools. Everything was as it should be. After dinner, if they had no visitors, Leonid Ivanovich sometimes read a book that was being much discussed at the time, and in the evening settled down to work, that is, read official papers, compared the depositions of witnesses, and noted paragraphs of the Code applying to them. This was neither dull nor amusing. It was dull when he might have been playing bridge, but if no bridge was available it was at any rate better than doing nothing or sitting with his wife. Leonid Ivanovich’s chief pleasure was giving little dinners to which he invited men and women of good social position, and just as his drawing-room resembled all other drawing-rooms so did his enjoyable little parties resemble all other such parties.\n\nOnce they even gave a dance. Leonid Ivanovich enjoyed it and everything went off well, except that it led to a violent quarrel with his wife about the cakes and sweets. Elena Mikhailova had made her own plans, but Leonid Ivanovich insisted on getting everything from an expensive confectioner and ordered too many cakes, and the quarrel occurred because some of those cakes were left over and the confectioner’s bill came to forty-five rubles. It was a great and disagreeable quarrel. Elena Mikhailova called him “a fool and an imbecile,” and he clutched at his head and made angry allusions to divorce.\n\nBut the dance itself had been enjoyable. The best people were there, and Leonid Ivanovich had danced with Princess Trufonova, a sister of the", "context_order": 1, "question": "What led Leonid Ivanovich to decide to go to Dmitrysburg in pursuit of a new post?", "answer": "He felt bored, depressed, and dissatisfied with his current life, salary, and lack of appreciation after being passed over for a promotion."}

He acknowledged that whatever disagreeable incident happened in his life, the pleasure that beamed like a ray of light above everything else was to sit down to bridge with good players, not noisy partners, and of course to four-handed bridge (with five players it was annoying to have to stand out, though one pretended not to mind), to play a clever and serious game (when the cards allowed it) and then to have supper and drink a glass of wine. after a game of bridge, especially if he had won a little (to win a large sum was unpleasant), Leonid Ivanovich went to bed in a specially good humour.\n\nSo they lived. They formed a circle of acquaintances among the best people and were visited by people of importance and by young folk. In their views as to their acquaintances, husband, wife and daughter were entirely agreed, and tacitly and unanimously kept at arm’s length and shook off the various shabby friends and relations who, with much show of affection, gushed into the drawing-room with its Japanese plates on the walls. Soon these shabby friends ceased to obtrude themselves and only the best people remained in the Golovins’ set.\n\nYoung men made up to Nina, and Martynov, an examining magistrate and Savva Martynov’s son and sole heir, began to be so attentive to her that Leonid Ivanovich had already spoken to Elena Mikhailova about it, and considered whether they should not arrange a party for them, or get up some private theatricals.\n\nSo they lived, and all went well, without change, and life flowed pleasantly.\n\nIV\nThey were all in good health. It could not be called ill health if Leonid Ivanovich sometimes said that he had a queer taste in his mouth and felt some discomfort in his left side.\n\nBut this discomfort increased and, though not exactly painful, grew into a sense of pressure in his side accompanied by ill humour. And his irritability became worse and worse and began to mar the agreeable, easy, and correct life that had established itself in the Golovin family. Quarrels between husband and wife became more and more frequent, and soon the ease and amenity disappeared and even the decorum was barely maintained. Scenes again became frequent, and very few of those islets remained on which husband and wife could meet without an explosion. Elena Mikhailova now had good reason to say that her husband’s temper was trying. With characteristic exaggeration she said he had always had a dreadful temper, and that it had needed all her good nature to put up with it for twenty years. It was true that now the quarrels were started by him. His bursts of temper always came just before dinner, often just as he began to eat his soup. Sometimes he noticed that a plate or dish was chipped, or the food was not right, or his son put his elbow on the table, or his daughter’s hair was not done as he liked it, and for all this he blamed Elena Mikhailova. At first she retorted and said disagreeable things to him, but once or twice he fell into such a rage at the beginning of dinner that she realized it was due to some physical derangement brought on by taking food, and so she restrained herself and did not answer, but only hurried to get the dinner over. She regarded this self-restraint as highly praiseworthy. Having come to the conclusion that her husband had a dreadful temper and made her life miserable, she began to feel sorry for herself, and the more she pitied herself the more she hated her husband. She began to wish he would die; yet she did not want him to die because then his salary would cease. And this irritated her against him still more. She considered herself dreadfully unhappy just because not even his death could save her, and though she concealed her exasperation, that hidden exasperation of hers increased his irritation also.\n\nAfter one scene in which Leonid Ivanovich had been particularly unfair and after which he had said in explanation that he certainly was irritable but that it was due to his not being well, she said that if he was ill it should be attended to, and insisted on his going to see a celebrated doctor.\n\nHe went. Everything took place as he had expected and as it always does. There was the usual waiting and the important air assumed by the doctor, with which he was so familiar (resembling that which he himself assumed in court), and the sounding and listening, and the questions which called for answers that were foregone conclusions and were evidently unnecessary, and the look of importance which implied that “if only you put yourself in our hands we will arrange everything — we know indubitably how it has to be done, always in the same way for everybody alike.” It was all just as it was in the law courts. The doctor put on just the same air towards him as he himself put on towards an accused person.\n\nThe doctor said that so-and-so indicated that there was so- and-so inside the patient, but if the investigation of so-and-so did not confirm this, then he must assume that and that. If he assumed that and that, then…and so on. To Leonid Ivanovich only one question was important: was his case serious or not? But the doctor ignored that inappropriate question. From his point of view it was not the one under consideration, the real question was to decide between a floating kidney, chronic catarrh, or appendicitis. It was not a question of the life of Leonid Ivanovich, but rather a dispute between the floating kidney and the appendix which the doctor solved brilliantly, as it seemed to Leonid Ivanovich, in favour of the appendix, with the reservation that should an examination of the urine give fresh indications the matter would be reconsidered. All this was just what Leonid Ivanovich had himself brilliantly accomplished a thousand times in dealing with men on trial. The doctor summed up just as brilliantly, looking over his spectacles triumphantly and even gaily at the accused. From the doctor’s summing up Leonid Ivanovich concluded that things were bad, but that for the doctor, and perhaps for everybody else, it was a matter of indifference, though for him it was bad. And this conclusion struck him painfully, arousing in him a great feeling of pity for himself and of bitterness towards the doctor’s indifference to a matter of such importance.\n\nHe said nothing of this, but rose, placed the doctor’s fee on the table, and remarked with a sigh: “We sick people probably often put inappropriate questions. But tell me, in general, is this complaint dangerous, or not?…”\n\nThe doctor looked at him sternly over his spectacles with one eye, as if to say: “Prisoner, if you will not keep to the questions put to you, I shall be obliged to have you removed from the court.”\n\n“I have already told you what I consider necessary and proper. The analysis may show something more.” And the doctor bowed.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich went out slowly, seated himself disconsolately in his sledge, and drove home. All the way home he was going over what the doctor had said, trying to translate those complicated, obscure, scientific phrases into plain language and find in them an answer to the question: “Is my condition bad? Is it very bad? Or is there as yet nothing much wrong?” And it seemed to him that the meaning of what the doctor had said was that it was very bad. Everything in the streets seemed depressing. The cabmen, the houses, the passers-by, and the shops, were dismal. His ache, this dull gnawing ache that never ceased for a moment, seemed to have acquired a new and more serious significance from the doctor’s dubious remarks. Leonid Ivanovich now watched it with a new and oppressive feeling.\n\nHe reached home and began to tell his wife about it. She listened, but in the middle of his account his daughter came in with her hat on, ready to go out with her mother. She sat down reluctantly to listen to this tedious story, but could not stand it long, and her mother too did not hear him to the end.\n\n“Well, I am very glad,” she said. “Mind now to take your medicine regularly. Give me the prescription and I’ll send Nikolai Petrov to the chemist’s.” And she went to get ready to go out.\n\nWhile she was in the room Leonid Ivanovich had hardly taken time to breathe, but he sighed deeply when she left it.\n\n“Well,” he thought, “perhaps it isn’t so bad after all.”\n\nHe began taking his medicine and following the doctor’s directions, which had been altered after the examination of the urine. but then it happened that there was a contradiction between the indications drawn from the examination of the urine and the symptoms that showed themselves. It turned out that what was happening differed from what the doctor had told him, and that he had either forgotten or blundered, or hidden something from him. He could not, however, be blamed for that, and Leonid Ivanovich still obeyed his orders implicitly and at first derived some comfort from doing so.\n\nFrom the time of his visit to the doctor, Leonid Ivanovich’s chief occupation was the exact fulfillment of the doctor’s instructions regarding hygiene and the taking of medicine, and the observation of his pain and his excretions. His chief interest came to be people’s ailments and people’s health. When sickness, deaths, or recoveries were mentioned in his presence, especially when the illness resembled his own, he listened with agitation which he tried to hide, asked questions, and applied what he heard to his own case.\n\nThe pain did not grow less, but Leonid Ivanovich made efforts to force himself to think that he was better. And he could do this so long as nothing agitated him. But as soon as he had any unpleasantness with his wife, any lack of success in his official work, or held bad cards at bridge, he was at once acutely sensible of his disease. He had formerly borne such mischances, hoping soon to adjust what was wrong, to master it and attain success, or make a grand slam. But now every mischance upset him and plunged him into despair. He would say to himself: “there now, just as I was beginning to get better and the medicine had begun to take effect, comes this accursed misfortune, or unpleasantness…” And he was furious with the mishap, or with the people who were causing the unpleasantness and killing him, for he felt that this fury was killing him but he could not restrain it. One would have thought that it should have been clear to him that this exasperation with circumstances and people aggravated his illness, and that he ought therefore to ignore unpleasant occurrences. But he drew the very opposite conclusion: he said that he needed peace, and he watched for everything that might disturb it and became irritable at the slightest infringement of it. His condition was rendered worse by the fact that he read medical books and consulted doctors. The progress of his disease was so gradual that he could deceive himself when comparing one day with another — the difference was so slight. But when he consulted the doctors it seemed to him that he was getting worse, and even very rapidly. Yet despite this he was continually consulting them.\n\nThat month he went to see another celebrity, who told him almost the same as the first had done but put his questions rather differently, and the interview with this celebrity only increased Leonid Ivanovich’s doubts and fears. A friend of a friend of his, a very good doctor, diagnosed his illness again quite differently from the others, and though he predicted recovery, his questions and suppositions bewildered Leonid Ivanovich still more and increased his doubts. A homeopathist diagnosed the disease in yet another way, and prescribed medicine which Leonid Ivanovich took secretly for a week. But after a week, not feeling any improvement and having lost confidence both in the former doctor’s treatment and in this one’s, he became still more despondent. One day a lady acquaintance mentioned a cure effected by a wonder-working icon. Leonid Ivanovich caught himself listening attentively and beginning to believe that it had occurred. This incident alarmed him. “Has my mind really weakened to such an extent?” he asked himself. “Nonsense! It’s all rubbish. I mustn’t give way to nervous fears but having chosen a doctor must keep strictly to his treatment. That is what I will do. Now it’s all settled. I won’t think about it, but will follow the treatment seriously till summer, and then we shall see. From now there must be no more of this wavering!” This was easy to say but impossible to carry out. The pain in his side oppressed him and seemed to grow worse and more incessant, while the taste in his mouth grew stranger and stranger. It seemed to him that his breath had a disgusting smell, and he was conscious of a loss of appetite and strength. There was no deceiving himself: something terrible, new, and more important than anything before in his life, was taking place within him of which he alone was aware. Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual. That tormented Leonid Ivanovich more than anything. He saw that his household, especially his wife and daughter who were in a perfect whirl of visiting, did not understand anything of it and were annoyed that he was so depressed and so exacting, as if he were to blame for it. Though they tried to disguise it he saw that he was an obstacle in their path, and that his wife had adopted a definite line in regard to his illness and kept to it regardless of anything he said or did. Her attitude was this: “You know,” she would say to her friends, “Leonid Ivanovich can’t do as other people do, and keep to the treatment prescribed for him. One day he’ll take his drops and keep strictly to his diet and go to bed in good time, but the next day unless I watch him he’ll suddenly forget his medicine, eat sturgeon — which is forbidden — and sit up playing cards till one o’clock in the morning.”\n\n“Oh, come, when was that?” Leonid Ivanovich would ask in vexation. “Only once at Dmitry Volkov’s.”\n\n“And yesterday with Adrian Kovalev.”\n\n“Well, even if I hadn’t stayed up, this pain would have kept me awake.”\n\n“Be that as it may you’ll never get well like that, but will always make us wretched.”\n\nElena Mikhailova’s attitude to Leonid Ivanovich’s illness, as she expressed it both to others and to him, was that it was his own fault and was another of the annoyances he caused her. Leonid Ivanovich felt that this opinion escaped her involuntarily — but that did not make it easier for him.\n\nAt the law courts too, Leonid Ivanovich noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude towards himself. It sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant. Then again, his friends would suddenly begin to chaff him in a friendly way about his low spirits, as if the awful, horrible, and unheard-of thing that was going on within him, incessantly gnawing at him and irresistibly drawing him away, was a very agreeable subject for jests. Roman Belov in particular irritated him by his jocularity, vivacity, and savoir-faire, which reminded him of what he himself had been ten years ago.\n\nFriends came to make up a set and they sat down to cards. They dealt, bending the new cards to soften them, and he sorted the diamonds in his hand and found he had seven. His partner said “No trumps” and supported him with two diamonds. What more could be wished for? It ought to be jolly and lively. They would make a grand slam. But suddenly Leonid Ivanovich was conscious of that gnawing pain, that taste in his mouth, and it seemed ridiculous that in such circumstances he should be pleased to make a grand slam.\n\nHe looked at his partner Arkadi Arkadev, who rapped the table with his strong hand and instead of snatching up the tricks pushed the cards courteously and indulgently towards Leonid Ivanovich that he might have the pleasure of gathering them up without the trouble of stretching out his hand for them. “Does he think I am too weak to stretch out my arm?” thought Leonid Ivanovich, and forgetting what he was doing he over-trumped his partner, missing the grand slam by three tricks. And what was most awful of all was that he saw how upset Arkadi Arkadev was about it but did not himself care. And it was dreadful to realize why he did not care.\n\nThey all saw that he was suffering, and said: “We can stop if you are tired. Take a rest.” Lie down? No, he was not at all tired, and he finished the rubber. All were gloomy and silent. Leonid Ivanovich felt that he had diffused this gloom over them and could not dispel it. They had supper and went away, and Leonid Ivanovich was left alone with the consciousness that his life was poisoned and was poisoning the lives of others, and that this poison did not weaken but penetrated more and more deeply into his whole being.\n\nWith this consciousness, and with physical pain besides the terror, he must go to bed, often to lie awake the greater part of the night. Next morning he had to get up again, dress, go to the law courts, speak, and write; or if he did not go out, spend at home those twenty-four hours a day each of which was a torture. And he had to live thus all alone on the brink of an abyss, with no one who understood or pitied him.\n\nV\nSo one month passed and then another. Just before the New Year his brother-in-law came to town and stayed at their house. Leonid Ivanovich was at the law courts and Elena Mikhailova had gone shopping. When Leonid Ivanovich came home and entered his study he found his brother-in-law there — a healthy, florid man — unpacking his portmanteau himself. He raised his head on hearing Leonid Ivanovich’s footsteps and looked up at him for a moment without a word. That stare told Leonid Ivanovich everything. His brother-in-law opened his mouth to utter an exclamation of surprise but checked himself, and that action confirmed it all.\n\n“I have changed, eh?”\n\n“Yes, there is a change.”\n\nAnd after that, try as he would to get his brother-in-law to return to the subject of his looks, the latter would say nothing about it. Elena Mikhailova came home and her brother went out to her. Leonid Ivanovich locked the door and began to examine himself in the glass, first full face, then in profile. He took up a portrait of himself taken with his wife, and compared it with what he saw in the glass. The change in him was immense. Then he bared his arms to the elbow, looked at them, drew the sleeves down again, sat down on an ottoman, and grew blacker than night.\n\n“No, no, this won’t do!” he said to himself, and jumped up, went to the table, took up some law papers and began to read them, but could not continue. He unlocked the door and went into the reception-room. The door leading to the drawing-room was shut. He approached it on tiptoe and listened.\n\n“No, you are exaggerating!” Elena Mikhailova was saying.\n\n“Exaggerating! Don’t you see it? Why, he’s a dead man! Look at his eyes — there’s no life in them. But what is it that is wrong with him?”\n\n“No one knows. Vitaly Sergeev [that was another doctor] said something, but I don’t know what. And Fedor Potemkin [this was the celebrated specialist] said quite the contrary…”\n\nLeonid Ivanovich walked away, went to his own room, lay down, and began musing; “The kidney, a floating kidney.” He recalled all the doctors had told him of how it detached itself and swayed about. And by an effort of imagination he tried to catch that kidney and arrest it and support it. So little was needed for this, it seemed to him. “No, I’ll go to see Dmitry Volkov again.” [That was the friend whose friend was a doctor.] He rang, ordered the carriage, and got ready to go.\n\n“Where are you going, Claude Dubois?” asked his wife with a specially sad and exceptionally kind look.\n\nThis exceptionally kind look irritated him. He looked morosely at her.\n\n“I must go to see Dmitry Volkov.”\n\nHe went to see Dmitry Volkov, and together they went to see his friend, the doctor. He was in, and Leonid Ivanovich had a long talk with him.\n\nReviewing the anatomical and physiological details of what in the doctor’s opinion was going on inside him, he understood it all.\n\nThere was something, a small thing, in the vermiform appendix. It might all come right. Only stimulate the energy of one organ and check the activity of another, then absorption would take place and everything would come right. He got home rather late for dinner, ate his dinner, and conversed cheerfully, but could not for a long time bring himself to go back to work in his room. At last, however, he went to his study and did what was necessary, but the consciousness that he had put something aside — an important, intimate matter which he would revert to when his work was done — never left him. When he had finished his work he remembered that this intimate matter was the thought of his vermiform appendix. But he did not give himself up to it, and went to the drawing-room for tea. There were callers there, including the examining magistrate who was a desirable match for his daughter, and they were conversing, playing the piano, and singing. Leonid Ivanovich, as Elena Mikhailova remarked, spent that evening more cheerfully than usual, but he never for a moment forgot that he had postponed the important matter of the appendix. At eleven o’clock he said goodnight and went to his bedroom. Since his illness he had slept alone in a small room next to his study. He undressed and took up a novel by Zola, but instead of reading it he fell into thought, and in his imagination that desired improvement in the vermiform appendix occurred. There was the absorption and evacuation and the re-establishment of normal activity. “Yes, that’s it!” he said to himself. “One need only assist nature, that’s all.” He remembered his medicine, rose, took it, and lay down on his back watching for the beneficent action of the medicine and for it to lessen the pain. “I need only take it regularly and avoid all injurious influences. I am already feeling better, much better.” He began touching his side: it was not painful to the touch. “There, I really don’t feel it. It’s much better already.” He put out the light and turned on his side … “The appendix is getting better, absorption is occurring.” Suddenly he felt the old, familiar, dull, gnawing pain, stubborn and serious. There was the same familiar loathsome taste in his mouth. His heart sank and he felt dazed. “My God! My God!” he muttered. “Again, again! And it will never cease.” And suddenly the matter presented itself in a quite different aspect. “Vermiform appendix! Kidney!” he said to himself. “It’s not a question of appendix or kidney, but of life and…death. Yes, life was there and now it is going, going and I cannot stop it. Yes. Why deceive myself? Isn’t it obvious to everyone but me that I’m dying, and that it’s only a question of weeks, days…it may happen this moment. There was light and now there is darkness. I was here and now I’m going there! Where?” A chill came over him, his breathing ceased, and he felt only the throbbing of his heart.\n\n“When I am not, what will there be? There will be nothing. Then where shall I be when I am no more? Can this be dying? No, I don’t want to!” He jumped up and tried to light the candle, felt for it with trembling hands, dropped candle and candlestick on the floor, and fell back on his pillow.\n\n“What’s the use? It makes no difference,” he said to himself, staring with wide-open eyes into the darkness. “Death. Yes, death. And none of them knows or wishes to know it, and they have no pity for me. Now they are playing.” (He heard through the door the distant sound of a song and its accompaniment.) “It’s all the same to them, but they will die too! Fools! I first, and they later, but it will be the same for them. And now they are merry…the beasts!”\n\nAnger choked him and he was agonizingly, unbearably miserable. “It is impossible that all men have been doomed to suffer this awful horror!” He raised himself.\n\n“Something must be wrong. I must calm myself — must think it all over from the beginning.” And he again began thinking. “Yes, the beginning of my illness: I knocked my side, but I was still quite well that day and the next. It hurt a little, then rather more. I saw the doctors, then followed despondency and anguish, more doctors, and I drew nearer to the abyss. My strength grew less and I kept coming nearer and nearer, and now I have wasted away and there is no light in my eyes. I think of the appendix — but this is death! I think of mending the appendix, and all the while here is death! Can it really be death?” Again terror seized him and he gasped for breath. He leant down and began feeling for the matches, pressing with his elbow on the stand beside the bed. It was in his way and hurt him, he grew furious with it, pressed on it still harder, and upset it. Breathless and in despair he fell on his back, expecting death to come immediately.\n\nMeanwhile the visitors were leaving. Elena Mikhailova was seeing them off. She heard something fall and came in.\n\n“What has happened?”\n\n“Nothing. I knocked it over accidentally.”\n\nShe went out and returned with a candle. He lay there panting heavily, like", "context_order": 2, "question": "What was Leonid Ivanovich's greatest pleasure in life?", "answer": "Playing bridge."}

I upset it.” (“Why speak of it? She won’t understand,” he thought.)\n\nAnd in truth she did not understand. She picked up the stand, lit his candle, and hurried away to see another visitor off. When she came back he still lay on his back, looking upwards.\n\n“What is it? Do you feel worse?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe shook her head and sat down.\n\n“Do you know, Claude Dubois, I think we must ask Fedor Potemkin to come and see you here.”\n\nThis meant calling in the famous specialist, regardless of expense. He smiled malignantly and said “No.” She remained a little longer and then went up to him and kissed his forehead.\n\nWhile she was kissing him he hated her from the bottom of his soul and with difficulty refrained from pushing her away.\n\n“Good night. Please God you’ll sleep.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nVI\nLeonid Ivanovich saw that he was dying, and he was in continual despair.\n\nIn the depth of his heart he knew he was dying, but not only was he not accustomed to the thought, he simply did not and could not grasp it.\n\nThe syllogism he had learnt from Wilhelm Neumann’s Logic: “Marcus Junius is a man, men are mortal, therefore Marcus Junius is mortal,” had always seemed to him correct as applied to Marcus Junius, but certainly not as applied to himself. That Marcus Junius — man in the abstract — was mortal, was perfectly correct, but he was not Marcus Junius, not an abstract man, but a creature quite, quite separate from all others. He had been little Leo, with a mamma and a papa, with Dima and Vlad, with the toys, a coachman and a nurse, afterwards with Katya and with all the joys, griefs, and delights of childhood, boyhood, and youth. What did Marcus Junius know of the smell of that striped leather ball Leo had been so fond of? Had Marcus Junius kissed his mother’s hand like that, and did the silk of her dress rustle so for Marcus Junius? Had he rioted like that at school when the pastry was bad? Had Marcus Junius been in love like that? Could Marcus Junius preside at a session as he did? “Marcus Junius really was mortal, and it was right for him to die; but for me, little Leo, Leonid Ivanovich, with all my thoughts and emotions, it’s altogether a different matter. It cannot be that I ought to die. That would be too terrible.”\n\nSuch was his feeling.\n\n“If I had to die like Marcus Junius I would have known it was so. An inner voice would have told me so, but there was nothing of the sort in me and I and all my friends felt that our case was quite different from that of Marcus Junius. And now here it is!” he said to himself. “It can’t be. It’s impossible! But here it is. How is this? How is one to understand it?”\n\nHe could not understand it, and tried to drive this false, incorrect, morbid thought away and to replace it by other proper and healthy thoughts. But that thought, and not the thought only but the reality itself, seemed to come and confront him.\n\nAnd to replace that thought he called up a succession of others, hoping to find in them some support. He tried to get back into the former current of thoughts that had once screened the thought of death from him. But strange to say, all that had formerly shut off, hidden, and destroyed his consciousness of death, no longer had that effect. Leonid Ivanovich now spent most of his time in attempting to re-establish that old current. He would say to himself: “I will take up my duties again — after all I used to live by them.” And banishing all doubts he would go to the law courts, enter into conversation with his colleagues, and sit carelessly as was his wont, scanning the crowd with a thoughtful look and leaning both his emaciated arms on the arms of his oak chair; bending over as usual to a colleague and drawing his papers nearer he would interchange whispers with him, and then suddenly raising his eyes and sitting erect would pronounce certain words and open the proceedings. But suddenly in the midst of those proceedings the pain in his side, regardless of the stage the proceedings had reached, would begin its own gnawing work. Leonid Ivanovich would turn his attention to it and try to drive the thought of it away, but without success. It would come and stand before him and look at him, and he would be petrified and the light would die out of his eyes, and he would again begin asking himself whether It alone was true. And his colleagues and subordinates would see with surprise and distress that he, the brilliant and subtle judge, was becoming confused and making mistakes. He would shake himself, try to pull himself together, manage somehow to bring the sitting to a close, and return home with the sorrowful consciousness that his judicial labours could not as formerly hide from him what he wanted them to hide, and could not deliver him from It. And what was worst of all was that It drew his attention to itself not in order to make him take some action but only that he should look at It, look it straight in the face: look at it and without doing anything, suffer inexpressibly.\n\nAnd to save himself from this condition Leonid Ivanovich looked for consolations — new screens — and new screens were found and for a while seemed to save him, but then they immediately fell to pieces or rather became transparent, as if It penetrated them and nothing could veil It.\n\nIn these latter days he would go into the drawing-room he had arranged — that drawing-room where he had fallen and for the sake of which (how bitterly ridiculous it seemed) he had sacrificed his life — for he knew that his illness originated with that knock. He would enter and see that something had scratched the polished table. He would look for the cause of this and find that it was the bronze ornamentation of an album, that had got bent. He would take up the expensive album which he had lovingly arranged, and feel vexed with his daughter and her friends for their untidiness — for the album was torn here and there and some of the photographs turned upside down. He would put it carefully in order and bend the ornamentation back into position. Then it would occur to him to place all those things in another corner of the room, near the plants. He would call the footman, but his daughter or wife would come to help him. They would not agree, and his wife would contradict him, and he would dispute and grow angry. But that was all right, for then he did not think about It. It was invisible.\n\nBut then, when he was moving something himself, his wife would say: “Let the servants do it. You will hurt yourself again.” And suddenly It would flash through the screen and he would see it. It was just a flash, and he hoped it would disappear, but he would involuntarily pay attention to his side. “It sits there as before, gnawing just the same!” And he could no longer forget It, but could distinctly see it looking at him from behind the flowers. “What is it all for?”\n\n“It really is so! I lost my life over that curtain as I might have done when storming a fort. Is that possible? How terrible and how stupid. It can’t be true! It can’t, but it is.”\n\nHe would go to his study, lie down, and again be alone with It: face to face with It. And nothing could be done with It except to look at it and shudder.\n\nVII\nHow it happened it is impossible to say because it came about step by step, unnoticed, but in the third month of Leonid Ivanovich’s illness, his wife, his daughter, his son, his acquaintances, the doctors, the servants, and above all he himself, were aware that the whole interest he had for other people was whether he would soon vacate his place, and at last release the living from the discomfort caused by his presence and be himself released from his sufferings.\n\nHe slept less and less. He was given opium and hypodermic injections of morphine, but this did not relieve him. The dull depression he experienced in a somnolent condition at first gave him a little relief, but only as something new, afterwards it became as distressing as the pain itself or even more so.\n\nSpecial foods were prepared for him by the doctors’ orders, but all those foods became increasingly distasteful and disgusting to him.\n\nFor his excretions also special arrangements had to be made, and this was a torment to him every time — a torment from the uncleanliness, the unseemliness, and the smell, and from knowing that another person had to take part in it.\n\nBut just through this most unpleasant matter, Leonid Ivanovich obtained comfort. Nikolai Petrov, the butler’s young assistant, always came in to carry the things out. Nikolai Petrov was a clean, fresh peasant lad, grown stout on town food and always cheerful and bright. At first the sight of him, in his clean Russian peasant costume, engaged on that disgusting task embarrassed Leonid Ivanovich.\n\nOnce when he got up from the commode too weak to draw up his trousers, he dropped into a soft armchair and looked with horror at his bare, enfeebled thighs with the muscles so sharply marked on them.\n\nNikolai Petrov with a firm light tread, his heavy boots emitting a pleasant smell of tar and fresh winter air, came in wearing a clean Hessian apron, the sleeves of his print shirt tucked up over his strong bare young arms; and refraining from looking at his sick master out of consideration for his feelings, and restraining the joy of life that beamed from his face, he went up to the commode.\n\n“Nikolai Petrov!” said Leonid Ivanovich in a weak voice.\n\n“Nikolai Petrov started, evidently afraid he might have committed some blunder, and with a rapid movement turned his fresh, kind, simple young face which just showed the first downy signs of a beard.\n\n“Yes, sir?”\n\n“That must be very unpleasant for you. You must forgive me. I am helpless.”\n\n“Oh, why, sir,” and Nikolai Petrov’s eyes beamed and he showed his glistening white teeth, “what’s a little trouble? It’s a case of illness with you, sir.”\n\nAnd his deft strong hands did their accustomed task, and he went out of the room stepping lightly. Five minutes later he as lightly returned.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich was still sitting in the same position in the armchair.\n\n“Nikolai Petrov,” he said when the latter had replaced the freshly- washed utensil. “Please come here and help me.” Nikolai Petrov went up to him. “Lift me up. It is hard for me to get up, and I have sent Dmitri away.”\n\nNikolai Petrov went up to him, grasped his master with his strong arms deftly but gently, in the same way that he stepped — lifted him, supported him with one hand, and with the other drew up his trousers and would have set him down again, but Leonid Ivanovich asked to be led to the sofa. Nikolai Petrov, without an effort and without apparent pressure, led him, almost lifting him, to the sofa and placed him on it.\n\n“Thank you. How easily and well you do it all!”\n\nNikolai Petrov smiled again and turned to leave the room. But Leonid Ivanovich felt his presence such a comfort that he did not want to let him go.\n\n“One thing more, please move up that chair. No, the other one — under my feet. It is easier for me when my feet are raised.”\n\nNikolai Petrov brought the chair, set it down gently in place, and raised Leonid Ivanovich’s legs on it. It seemed to Leonid Ivanovich that he felt better while Nikolai Petrov was holding up his legs.\n\n“It’s better when my legs are higher,” he said. “Place that cushion under them.”\n\nNikolai Petrov did so. He again lifted the legs and placed them, and again Leonid Ivanovich felt better while Nikolai Petrov held his legs. When he set them down Leonid Ivanovich fancied he felt worse.\n\n“Nikolai Petrov,” he said. “Are you busy now?”\n\n“Not at all, sir,” said Nikolai Petrov, who had learnt from the townsfolk how to speak to gentlefolk.\n\n“What have you still to do?”\n\n“What have I to do? I’ve done everything except chopping the logs for tomorrow.”\n\n“Then hold my legs up a bit higher, can you?”\n\n“Of course I can. Why not?” and Nikolai Petrov raised his master’s legs higher and Leonid Ivanovich thought that in that position he did not feel any pain at all.\n\n“And how about the logs?”\n\n“Don’t trouble about that, sir. There’s plenty of time.”\n\nLeonid Ivanovich told Nikolai Petrov to sit down and hold his legs, and began to talk to him. And strange to say it seemed to him that he felt better while Nikolai Petrov held his legs up.\n\nAfter that Leonid Ivanovich would sometimes call Nikolai Petrov and get him to hold his legs on his shoulders, and he liked talking to him. Nikolai Petrov did it all easily, willingly, simply, and with a good nature that touched Leonid Ivanovich. Health, strength, and vitality in other people were offensive to him, but Nikolai Petrov’s strength and vitality did not mortify but soothed him.\n\nWhat tormented Leonid Ivanovich most was the deception, the lie, which for some reason they all accepted, that he was not dying but was simply ill, and he only need keep quiet and undergo a treatment and then something very good would result. He however knew that do what they would nothing would come of it, only still more agonizing suffering and death. This deception tortured him — their not wishing to admit what they all knew and what he knew, but wanting to lie to him concerning his terrible condition, and wishing and forcing him to participate in that lie. Those lies — lies enacted over him on the eve of his death and destined to degrade this awful, solemn act to the level of their visitings, their curtains, their sturgeon for dinner — were a terrible agony for Leonid Ivanovich. And strangely enough, many times when they were going through their antics over him he had been within a hairbreadth of calling out to them: “Stop lying! You know and I know that I am dying. Then at least stop lying about it!” But he had never had the spirit to do it. The awful, terrible act of his dying was, he could see, reduced by those about him to the level of a casual, unpleasant, and almost indecorous incident (as if someone entered a drawing room diffusing an unpleasant odour) and this was done by that very decorum which he had served all his life long. He saw that no one felt for him, because no one even wished to grasp his position. Only Nikolai Petrov recognized it and pitied him. And so Leonid Ivanovich felt at ease only with him. He felt comforted when Nikolai Petrov supported his legs (sometimes all night long) and refused to go to bed, saying: “Don’t you worry, Leonid Ivanovich. I’ll get sleep enough later on,” or when he suddenly became familiar and exclaimed: “If you weren’t sick it would be another matter, but as it is, why should I grudge a little trouble?” Nikolai Petrov alone did not lie; everything showed that he alone understood the facts of the case and did not consider it necessary to disguise them, but simply felt sorry for his emaciated and enfeebled master. Once when Leonid Ivanovich was sending him away he even said straight out: “We shall all of us die, so why should I grudge a little trouble?” — expressing the fact that he did not think his work burdensome, because he was doing it for a dying man and hoped someone would do the same for him when his time came.\n\nApart from this lying, or because of it, what most tormented Leonid Ivanovich was that no one pitied him as he wished to be pitied. At certain moments after prolonged suffering he wished most of all (though he would have been ashamed to confess it) for someone to pity him as a sick child is pitied. He longed to be petted and comforted. he knew he was an important functionary, that he had a beard turning grey, and that therefore what he longed for was impossible, but still he longed for it. And in Nikolai Petrov’s attitude towards him there was something akin to what he wished for, and so that attitude comforted him. Leonid Ivanovich wanted to weep, wanted to be petted and cried over, and then his colleague Adrian Kovalev would come, and instead of weeping and being petted, Leonid Ivanovich would assume a serious, severe, and profound air, and by force of habit would express his opinion on a decision of the Court of Cassation and would stubbornly insist on that view. This falsity around him and within him did more than anything else to poison his last days.\n\nVIII\nIt was morning. He knew it was morning because Nikolai Petrov had gone, and Dmitry the footman had come and put out the candles, drawn back one of the curtains, and begun quietly to tidy up. Whether it was morning or evening, Friday or Sunday, made no difference, it was all just the same: the gnawing, unmitigated, agonizing pain, never ceasing for an instant, the consciousness of life inexorably waning but not yet extinguished, the approach of that ever dreaded and hateful Death which was the only reality, and always the same falsity. What were days, weeks, hours, in such a case?\n\n“Will you have some tea, sir?”\n\n“He wants things to be regular, and wishes the gentlefolk to drink tea in the morning,” thought ivan Ilych, and only said “No.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you like to move onto the sofa, sir?”\n\n“He wants to tidy up the room, and I’m in the way. I am uncleanliness and disorder,” he thought, and said only:\n\n“No, leave me alone.”\n\nThe man went on bustling about. Leonid Ivanovich stretched out his hand. Dmitry came up, ready to help.\n\n“What is it, sir?”\n\n“My watch.”\n\nDmitry took the watch which was close at hand and gave it to his master.\n\n“Half-past eight. Are they up?”\n\n“No sir, except Ivan Ivanovich” (the son) “who has gone to school. Elena Mikhailova ordered me to wake her if you asked for her. Shall I do so?”\n\n“No, there’s no need to.” “Perhaps I’d better have some tea,” he thought, and added aloud: “Yes, bring me some tea.”\n\nDmitry went to the door, but Leonid Ivanovich dreaded being left alone. “How can I keep him here? Oh yes, my medicine.” –Dmitry, give me my medicine.– “Why not? Perhaps it may still do some good.” He took a spoonful and swallowed it. “No, it won’t help. It’s all tomfoolery, all deception,” he decided as soon as he became aware of the familiar, sickly, hopeless taste. “No, I can’t believe in it any longer. But the pain, why this pain? If it would only cease just for a moment!” And he moaned. Dmitry turned towards him. “It’s all right. Go and fetch me some tea.”\n\nDmitry went out. Left alone Leonid Ivanovich groaned not so much with pain, terrible though that was, as from mental anguish. Always and for ever the same, always these endless days and nights. If only it would come quicker! If only what would come quicker? Death, darkness?…No, no! anything rather than death!\n\nWhen Dmitry returned with the tea on a tray, Leonid Ivanovich stared at him for a time in perplexity, not realizing who and what he was. Dmitry was disconcerted by that look and his embarrassment brought Leonid Ivanovich to himself.\n\n“Oh, tea! All right, put it down. Only help me to wash and put on a clean shirt.”\n\nAnd Leonid Ivanovich began to wash. With pauses for rest, he washed his hands and then his face, cleaned his teeth, brushed his hair, looked in the glass. He was terrified by what he saw, especially by the limp way in which his hair clung to his pallid forehead.\n\nWhile his shirt was being changed he knew that he would be still more frightened at the sight of his body, so he avoided looking at it. Finally he was ready. He drew on a dressing-gown, wrapped himself in a plaid, and sat down in the armchair to take his tea. For a moment he felt refreshed, but as soon as he began to drink the tea he was again aware of the same taste, and the pain also returned. He finished it with an effort, and then lay down stretching out his legs, and dismissed Dmitry.\n\nAlways the same. Now a spark of hope flashes up, then a sea of despair rages, and always pain; always pain, always despair, and always the same. When alone he had a dreadful and distressing desire to call someone, but he knew beforehand that with others present it would be still worse. “Another dose of morphine–to lose consciousness. I will tell him, the doctor, that he must think of something else. It’s impossible, impossible, to go on like this.”\n\nAn hour and another pass like that. But now there is a ring at the door bell. Perhaps it’s the doctor? It is. He comes in fresh, hearty, plump, and cheerful, with that look on his face that seems to say: “There now, you’re in a panic about something, but we’ll arrange it all for you directly!” The doctor knows this expression is out of place here, but he has put it on once for all and can’t take it off — like a man who has put on a frock-coat in the morning to pay a round of calls.\n\nThe doctor rubs his hands vigorously and reassuringly.\n\n“Brr! How cold it is! There’s such a sharp frost; just let me warm myself!” he says, as if it were only a matter of waiting till he was warm, and then he would put everything right.\n\n“Well now, how are you?”\n\nLeonid Ivanovich feels that the doctor would like to say: “Well, how are our affairs?” but that even he feels that this would not do, and says instead: “What sort of a night have you had?”\n\nLeonid Ivanovich looks at him as much as to say: “Are you really never ashamed of lying?” But the doctor does not wish to understand this question, and Leonid Ivanovich says: “Just as terrible as ever. The pain never leaves me and never subsides. If only something … ”\n\n“Yes, you sick people are always like that…. There, now I think I am warm enough. Even Elena Mikhailova, who is so particular, could find no fault with my temperature. Well, now I can say good-morning,” and the doctor presses his patient’s hand.\n\nThen dropping his former playfulness, he begins with a most serious face to examine the patient, feeling his pulse and taking his temperature, and then begins the sounding and auscultation.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich knows quite well and definitely that all this is nonsense and pure deception, but when the doctor, getting down on his knee, leans over him, putting his ear first higher then lower, and performs various gymnastic movements over him with a significant expression on his face, Leonid Ivanovich submits to it all as he used to submit to the speeches of the lawyers, though he knew very well that they were all lying and why they were lying.\n\nThe doctor, kneeling on the sofa, is still sounding him when Elena Mikhailova’s silk dress rustles at the door and she is heard scolding Dmitry for not having let her know of the doctor’s arrival.\n\nShe comes in, kisses her husband, and at once proceeds to prove that she has been up a long time already, and only owing to a misunderstanding failed to be there when the doctor arrived.\n\nLeonid Ivanovich looks at her, scans her all over, sets against her the whiteness and plumpness and cleanness of her hands and neck, the gloss of her hair, and the sparkle of her vivacious eyes. He hates her with his whole soul. And the thrill of hatred he feels for her makes him suffer from her touch.\n\nHer attitude towards him and his disease is still the same. Just as the doctor had adopted a certain relation to his patient which he could not abandon, so had she formed one towards him — that he was not doing something he ought to do and was himself to blame, and that she reproached him lovingly for this — and she could not now change that attitude.\n\n“You see he doesn’t listen to me and doesn’t take his medicine at the proper time. And above all he lies in a position that is no doubt bad for him — with his legs up.”\n\nShe described how he made Nikolai Petrov hold his legs up.\n\nThe doctor smiled with a contemptuous affability that said: “What’s to be done? These sick people do have foolish fancies of that kind, but we must forgive them.”\n\nWhen the examination was over the doctor looked at his watch, and then Elena Mikhailova announced to Leonid Ivanovich that it was of course as he pleased, but she had sent today for a celebrated specialist who would examine him and have a consultation with Boris Andreyev (their regular doctor).\n\n“Please don’t raise any objections. I am doing this for my own sake,” she said ironically, letting it be felt that she was doing it all for his sake and only said this to leave him no right to refuse. He remained silent, knitting his brows. He felt that he was surrounded and involved in such a mesh of falsity that it was hard to unravel anything.\n\nEverything she did for him was entirely for her own sake, and she told him she was doing for herself what she actually was doing for herself, as if that was so incredible that he must understand the opposite.\n\nAt half-past eleven the celebrated specialist arrived. Again the sounding began and the significant conversations in his presence and in another room, about the kidney and the appendix, and the questions and answers, with such an air of importance that again, instead of the real question of life and death which now alone confronted him, the question arose of the kidney and appendix which were not behaving as they ought to and would now be attacked by Boris Andreyev and the specialist and forced to amend their ways.\n\nThe celebrated specialist took leave of him with a serious though not hopeless look, and in reply to the timid question Leonid Ivanovich, with eyes glistening with fear and hope, put to him as to whether there was a chance of recovery, said that he could not vouch for it but there was a possibility. The look of hope with which Leonid Ivanovich watched the doctor out was so pathetic that Elena Mikh", "context_order": 3, "question": "What does Leonid Ivanovich believe is causing his suffering?", "answer": "He believes that he is dying and that the pain is the only reality."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Death of Ivan Ilich.txt", "context": "ailova, seeing it, even wept as she left the room to hand the doctor his fee.\n\nThe gleam of hope kindled by the doctor’s encouragement did not last long. The same room, the same pictures, curtains, wall- paper, medicine bottles, were all there, and the same aching suffering body, and Leonid Ivanovich began to moan. They gave him a subcutaneous injection and he sank into oblivion.\n\nIt was twilight when he came to. They brought him his dinner and he swallowed some beef tea with difficulty, and then everything was the same again and night was coming on.\n\nAfter dinner, at seven o’clock, Elena Mikhailova came into the room in evening dress, her full bosom pushed up by her corset, and with traces of powder on her face. She had reminded him in the morning that they were going to the theatre. Sarah Bernhardt was visiting the town and they had a box, which he had insisted on their taking. Now he had forgotten about it and her toilet offended him, but he concealed his vexation when he remembered that he had himself insisted on their securing a box and going because it would be an instructive and aesthetic pleasure for the children.\n\nElena Mikhailova came in, self-satisfied but yet with a rather guilty air. She sat down and asked how he was, but, as he saw, only for the sake of asking and not in order to learn about it, knowing that there was nothing to learn — and then went on to what she really wanted to say: that she would not on any account have gone but that the box had been taken and Helen and their daughter were going, as well as Martynov (the examining magistrate, their daughter’s fiance) and that it was out of the question to let them go alone; but that she would have much preferred to sit with him for a while; and he must be sure to follow the doctor’s orders while she was away.\n\n“Oh, and Maxim Gromov” (the fiance) “would like to come in. May he? And Nina?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nTheir daughter came in in full evening dress, her fresh young flesh exposed (making a show of that very flesh which in his own case caused so much suffering), strong, healthy, evidently in love, and impatient with illness, suffering, and death, because they interfered with her happiness.\n\nMaxim Gromov came in too, in evening dress, his hair curled à la Capoul, a tight stiff collar round his long sinewy neck, an enormous white shirt-front and narrow black trousers tightly stretched over his strong thighs. He had one white glove tightly drawn on, and was holding his opera hat in his hand.\n\nFollowing him the schoolboy crept in unnoticed, in a new uniform, poor little fellow, and wearing gloves. Terribly dark shadows showed under his eyes, the meaning of which Leonid Ivanovich knew well.\n\nHis son had always seemed pathetic to him, and now it was dreadful to see the boy’s frightened look of pity. It seemed to Leonid Ivanovich that Alexei was the only one besides Nikolai Petrov who understood and pitied him.\n\nThey all sat down and again asked how he was. A silence followed. Nina asked her mother about the opera glasses, and there was an altercation between mother and daughter as to who had taken them and where they had been put. This occasioned some unpleasantness.\n\nMaxim Gromov inquired of Leonid Ivanovich whether he had ever seen Sarah Bernhardt. Leonid Ivanovich did not at first catch the question, but then replied: “No, have you seen her before?”\n\n“Yes, in Adrienne Lecouvreur.”\n\nElena Mikhailova mentioned some roles in which Sarah Bernhardt was particularly good. Her daughter disagreed. Conversation sprang up as to the elegance and realism of her acting — the sort of conversation that is always repeated and is always the same.\n\nIn the midst of the conversation Maxim Gromov glanced at Leonid Ivanovich and became silent. The others also looked at him and grew silent. Leonid Ivanovich was staring with glittering eyes straight before him, evidently indignant with them. This had to be rectified, but it was impossible to do so. The silence had to be broken, but for a time no one dared to break it and they all became afraid that the conventional deception would suddenly become obvious and the truth become plain to all. Nina was the first to pluck up courage and break that silence, but by trying to hide what everybody was feeling, she betrayed it.\n\n“Well, if we are going it’s time to start,” she said, looking at her watch, a present from her father, and with a faint and significant smile at Maxim Gromov relating to something known only to them. She got up with a rustle of her dress.\n\nThey all rose, said good-night, and went away.\n\nWhen they had gone it seemed to Leonid Ivanovich that he felt better; the falsity had gone with them. But the pain remained — that same pain and that same fear that made everything monotonously alike, nothing harder and nothing easier. Everything was worse.\n\nAgain minute followed minute and hour followed hour. Everything remained the same and there was no cessation. And the inevitable end of it all became more and more terrible.\n\n“Yes, send Nikolai Petrov here,” he replied to a question Dmitry asked.\n\nIX\nHis wife returned late at night. She came in on tiptoe, but he heard her, opened his eyes, and made haste to close them again. She wished to send Nikolai Petrov away and to sit with him herself, but he opened his eyes and said: “No, go away.”\n\n“Are you in great pain?”\n\n“Always the same.”\n\n“Take some opium.”\n\nHe agreed and took some. She went away.\n\nTill about three in the morning he was in a state of stupefied misery. It seemed to him that he and his pain were being thrust into a narrow, deep black sack, but though they were pushed further and further in they could not be pushed to the bottom. And this, terrible enough in itself, was accompanied by suffering. He was frightened yet wanted to fall through the sack, he struggled but yet co-operated. And suddenly he broke through, fell, and regained consciousness. Nikolai Petrov was sitting at the foot of the bed dozing quietly and patiently, while he himself lay with his emaciated stockinged legs resting on Nikolai Petrov’s shoulders; the same shaded candle was there and the same unceasing pain.\n\n“Go away, Nikolai Petrov,” he whispered.\n\n“It’s all right, sir. I’ll stay a while.”\n\n“No. Go away.”\n\nHe removed his legs from Nikolai Petrov’s shoulders, turned sideways onto his arm, and felt sorry for himself. He only waited till Nikolai Petrov had gone into the next room and then restrained himself no longer but wept like a child. He wept on account of his helplessness, his terrible loneliness, the cruelty of man, the cruelty of God, and the absence of God.\n\n“Why hast Thou done all this? Why hast Thou brought me here? Why, why dost Thou torment me so terribly?”\n\nHe did not expect an answer and yet wept because there was no answer and could be none. The pain again grew more acute, but he did not stir and did not call. He said to himself: “Go on! Strike me! But what is it for? What have I done to Thee? What is it for?”\n\nThen he grew quiet and not only ceased weeping but even held his breath and became all attention. It was as though he were listening not to an audible voice but to the voice of his soul, to the current of thoughts arising within him.\n\n“What is it you want?” was the first clear conception capable of expression in words, that he heard.\n\n“What do you want? What do you want?” he repeated to himself.\n\n“What do I want? To live and not to suffer,” he answered.\n\nAnd again he listened with such concentrated attention that even his pain did not distract him.\n\n“To live? How?” asked his inner voice.\n\n“Why, to live as I used to — well and pleasantly.”\n\n“As you lived before, well and pleasantly?” the voice repeated.\n\nAnd in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life. But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed — none of them except the first recollections of childhood. There, in childhood, there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return. But the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer, it was like a reminiscence of somebody else.\n\nAs soon as the period began which had produced the present Leonid Ivanovich, all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty.\n\nAnd the further he departed from childhood and the nearer he came to the present the more worthless and doubtful were the joys. This began with the School of Law. A little that was really good was still found there — there was light-heartedness, friendship, and hope. But in the upper classes there had already been fewer of such good moments. Then during the first years of his official career, when he was in the service of the governor, some pleasant moments again occurred: they were the memories of love for a woman. Then all became confused and there was still less of what was good; later on again there was still less that was good, and the further he went the less there was. His marriage, a mere accident, then the disenchantment that followed it, his wife’s bad breath and the sensuality and hypocrisy: then that deadly official life and those preoccupations about money, a year of it, and two, and ten, and twenty, and always the same thing. And the longer it lasted the more deadly it became. “It is as if I had been going downhill while I imagined I was going up. And that is really what it was. I was going up in public opinion, but to the same extent life was ebbing away from me. And now it is all done and there is only death.\n\n“Then what does it mean? Why? It can’t be that life is so senseless and horrible. But if it really has been so horrible and senseless, why must I die and die in agony? There is something wrong!\n\n“Maybe I did not live as I ought to have done,” it suddenly occurred to him. “But how could that be, when I did everything properly?” he replied, and immediately dismissed from his mind this, the sole solution of all the riddles of life and death, as something quite impossible.\n\n“Then what do you want now? To live? Live how? Live as you lived in the law courts when the usher proclaimed ‘The judge is coming!’ The judge is coming, the judge!” he repeated to himself. “Here he is, the judge. But I am not guilty!” he exclaimed angrily. “What is it for?” And he ceased crying, but turning his face to the wall continued to ponder on the same question: Why, and for what purpose, is there all this horror? But however much he pondered he found no answer. And whenever the thought occurred to him, as it often did, that it all resulted from his not having lived as he ought to have done, he at once recalled the correctness of his whole life and dismissed so strange an idea.\n\nX\nAnother fortnight passed. Leonid Ivanovich now no longer left his sofa. He would not lie in bed but lay on the sofa, facing the wall nearly all the time. He suffered ever the same unceasing agonies and in his loneliness pondered always on the same insoluble question: “What is this? Can it be that it is Death?” And the inner voice answered: “Yes, it is Death.”\n\n“Why these sufferings?” And the voice answered, “For no reason — they just are so.” Beyond and besides this there was nothing.\n\nFrom the very beginning of his illness, ever since he had first been to see the doctor, Leonid Ivanovich’s life had been divided between two contrary and alternating moods: now it was despair and the expectation of this uncomprehended and terrible death, and now hope and an intently interested observation of the functioning of his organs. Now before his eyes there was only a kidney or an intestine that temporarily evaded its duty, and now only that incomprehensible and dreadful death from which it was impossible to escape.\n\nThese two states of mind had alternated from the very beginning of his illness, but the further it progressed the more doubtful and fantastic became the conception of the kidney, and the more real the sense of impending death.\n\nHe had but to call to mind what he had been three months before and what he was now, to call to mind with what regularity he had been going downhill, for every possibility of hope to be shattered.\n\nLatterly during the loneliness in which he found himself as he lay facing the back of the sofa, a loneliness in the midst of a populous town and surrounded by numerous acquaintances and relations but that yet could not have been more complete anywhere — either at the bottom of the sea or under the earth — during that terrible loneliness Ivan ilych had lived only in memories of the past. Pictures of his past rose before him one after another. They always began with what was nearest in time and then went back to what was most remote — to his childhood — and rested there. If he thought of the stewed prunes that had been offered him that day, his mind went back to the raw shrivelled French plums of his childhood, their peculiar flavour and the flow of saliva when he sucked their stones, and along with the memory of that taste came a whole series of memories of those days: his nurse, his brother, and their toys. “No, I mustn’t thing of that….It is too painful,” Leonid Ivanovich said to himself, and brought himself back to the present — to the button on the back of the sofa and the creases in its morocco. “Morocco is expensive, but it does not wear well: there had been a quarrel about it. It was a different kind of quarrel and a different kind of morocco that time when we tore father’s portfolio and were punished, and mamma brought us some tarts….” And again his thoughts dwelt on his childhood, and again it was painful and he tried to banish them and fix his mind on something else.\n\nThen again together with that chain of memories another series passed through his mind — of how his illness had progressed and grown worse. There also the further back he looked the more life there had been. There had been more of what was good in life and more of life itself. The two merged together. “Just as the pain went on getting worse and worse, so my life grew worse and worse,” he thought. “There is one bright spot there at the back, at the beginning of life, and afterwards all becomes blacker and blacker and proceeds more and more rapidly — in inverse ration to the square of the distance from death,” thought Leonid Ivanovich. And the example of a stone falling downwards with increasing velocity entered his mind. Life, a series of increasing sufferings, flies further and further towards its end — the most terrible suffering. “I am flying….” He shuddered, shifted himself, and tried to resist, but was already aware that resistance was impossible, and again with eyes weary of gazing but unable to cease seeing what was before them, he stared at the back of the sofa and waited — awaiting that dreadful fall and shock and destruction.\n\n“Resistance is impossible!” he said to himself. “If I could only understand what it is all for! But that too is impossible. An explanation would be possible if it could be said that I have not lived as I ought to. But it is impossible to say that,” and he remembered all the legality, correctitude, and propriety of his life. “That at any rate can certainly not be admitted,” he thought, and his lips smiled ironically as if someone could see that smile and be taken in by it. “There is no explanation! Agony, death….What for?”\n\nXI\nAnother two weeks went by in this way and during that fortnight an even occurred that Leonid Ivanovich and his wife had desired. Martynov formally proposed. It happened in the evening. The next day Elena Mikhailova came into her husband’s room considering how best to inform him of it, but that very night there had been a fresh change for the worse in his condition. She found him still lying on the sofa but in a different position. He lay on his back, groaning and staring fixedly straight in front of him.\n\nShe began to remind him of his medicines, but he turned his eyes towards her with such a look that she did not finish what she was saying; so great an animosity, to her in particular, did that look express.\n\n“For Christ’s sake let me die in peace!” he said.\n\nShe would have gone away, but just then their daughter came in and went up to say good morning. He looked at her as he had done at his wife, and in reply to her inquiry about his health said dryly that he would soon free them all of himself. They were both silent and after sitting with him for a while went away.\n\n“Is it our fault?” Nina said to her mother. “It’s as if we were to blame! I am sorry for papa, but why should we be tortured?”\n\nThe doctor came at his usual time. Leonid Ivanovich answered “Yes” and “No,” never taking his angry eyes from him, and at last said: “You know you can do nothing for me, so leave me alone.”\n\n“We can ease your sufferings.”\n\n“You can’t even do that. Let me be.”\n\nThe doctor went into the drawing room and told Elena Mikhailova that the case was very serious and that the only resource left was opium to allay her husband’s sufferings, which must be terrible.\n\nIt was true, as the doctor said, that Leonid Ivanovich’s physical sufferings were terrible, but worse than the physical sufferings were his mental sufferings which were his chief torture.\n\nHis mental sufferings were due to the fact that that night, as he looked at Nikolai Petrov’s sleepy, good-natured face with its prominent cheek-bones, the question suddenly occurred to him: “What if my whole life has been wrong?”\n\nIt occurred to him that what had appeared perfectly impossible before, namely that he had not spent his life as he should have done, might after all be true. It occurred to him that his scarcely perceptible attempts to struggle against what was considered good by the most highly placed people, those scarcely noticeable impulses which he had immediately suppressed, might have been the real thing, and all the rest false. And his professional duties and the whole arrangement of his life and of his family, and all his social and official interests, might all have been false. He tried to defend all those things to himself and suddenly felt the weakness of what he was defending. There was nothing to defend.\n\n“But if that is so,” he said to himself, “and I am leaving this life with the consciousness that I have lost all that was given me and it is impossible to rectify it — what then?”\n\nHe lay on his back and began to pass his life in review in quite a new way. In the morning when he saw first his footman, then his wife, then his daughter, and then the doctor, their every word and movement confirmed to him the awful truth that had been revealed to him during the night. In them he saw himself — all that for which he had lived — and saw clearly that it was not real at all, but a terrible and huge deception which had hidden both life and death. This consciousness intensified his physical suffering tenfold. He groaned and tossed about, and pulled at his clothing which choked and stifled him. And he hated them on that account.\n\nHe was given a large dose of opium and became unconscious, but at noon his sufferings began again. He drove everybody away and tossed from side to side.\n\nHis wife came to him and said:\n\n“Claude Dubois, my dear, do this for me. It can’t do any harm and often helps. Healthy people often do it.”\n\nHe opened his eyes wide.\n\n“What? Take communion? Why? It’s unnecessary! However…”\n\nShe began to cry.\n\n“Yes, do, my dear. I’ll send for our priest. He is such a nice man.”\n\n“All right. Very well,” he muttered.\n\nWhen the priest came and heard his confession, Leonid Ivanovich was softened and seemed to feel a relief from his doubts and consequently from his sufferings, and for a moment there came a ray of hope. He again began to think of the vermiform appendix and the possibility of correcting it. He received the sacrament with tears in his eyes.\n\nWhen they laid him down again afterwards he felt a moment’s ease, and the hope that he might live awoke in him again. He began to think of the operation that had been suggested to him. “To live! I want to live!” he said to himself.\n\nHis wife came in to congratulate him after his communion, and when uttering the usual conventional words she added:\n\n“You feel better, don’t you?”\n\nWithout looking at her he said “Yes.”\n\nHer dress, her figure, the expression of her face, the tone of her voice, all revealed the same thing. “This is wrong, it is not as it should be. All you have lived for and still live for is falsehood and deception, hiding life and death from you.” And as soon as he admitted that thought, his hatred and his agonizing physical suffering again sprang up, and with that suffering a consciousness of the unavoidable, approaching end. And to this was added a new sensation of grinding shooting pain and a feeling of suffocation.\n\nThe expression of his face when he uttered that “Yes” was dreadful. Having uttered it, he looked her straight in the eyes, turned on his face with a rapidity extraordinary in his weak state and shouted:\n\n“Go away! Go away and leave me alone!”\n\nXII\nFrom that moment the screaming began that continued for three days, and was so terrible that one could not hear it through two closed doors without horror. At the moment he answered his wife realized that he was lost, that there was no return, that the end had come, the very end, and his doubts were still unsolved and remained doubts.\n\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!” he cried in various intonations. He had begun by screaming “I won’t!” and continued screaming on the letter “O”.\n\nFor three whole days, during which time did not exist for him, he struggled in that black sack into which he was being thrust by an invisible, resistless force. He struggled as a man condemned to death struggles in the hands of the executioner, knowing that he cannot save himself. And every moment he felt that despite all his efforts he was drawing nearer and nearer to what terrified him. He felt that his agony was due to his being thrust into that black hole and still more to his not being able to get right into it. He was hindered from getting into it by his conviction that his life had been a good one. That very justification of his life held him fast and prevented his moving forward, and it caused him the most torment of all.\n\nSuddenly some force struck him in the chest and side, making it still harder to breathe, and he fell through the hole and there at the bottom was a light. What had happened to him was like the sensation one sometimes experiences in a railway carriage when one thinks one is going backwards while one is really going forwards and suddenly becomes aware of the real direction.\n\n“Yes, it was not the right thing,” he said to himself, “but that’s no matter. It can be done. But what is the right thing? he asked himself, and suddenly grew quiet.\n\nThis occurred at the end of the third day, two hours before his death. Just then his schoolboy son had crept softly in and gone up to the bedside. The dying man was still screaming desperately and waving his arms. His hand fell on the boy’s head, and the boy caught it, pressed it to his lips, and began to cry.\n\nAt that very moment Leonid Ivanovich fell through and caught sight of the light, and it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, this could still be rectified. He asked himself, “What is the right thing?” and grew still, listening. Then he felt that someone was kissing his hand. He opened his eyes, looked at his son, and felt sorry for him. His wife camp up to him and he glanced at her. She was gazing at him open-mouthed, with undried tears on her nose and cheek and a despairing look on her face. He felt sorry for her too.\n\n“Yes, I am making them wretched,” he thought. “They are sorry, but it will be better for them when I die.” He wished to say this but had not the strength to utter it. “Besides, why speak? I must act,” he thought. with a look at his wife he indicated his son and said: “Take him away…sorry for him…sorry for you too….” He tried to add, “Forgive me,” but said “Forego” and waved his hand, knowing that He whose understanding mattered would understand.\n\nAnd suddenly it grew clear to him that what had been oppressing him and would not leave him was all dropping away at once from two sides, from ten sides, and from all sides. He was sorry for them, he must act so as not to hurt them: release them and free himself from these sufferings. “How good and how simple!” he thought. “And the pain?” he asked himself. “What has become of it? Where are you, pain?”\n\nHe turned his attention to it.\n\n“Yes, here it is. Well, what of it? Let the pain be.”\n\n“And death…where is it?”\n\nHe sought his former accustomed fear of death and did not find it. “Where is it? What death?” There was no fear because there was no death.\n\nIn place of death there was light.\n\n“So that’s what it is!” he suddenly exclaimed aloud. “What joy!”\n\nTo him all this happened in a single instant, and the meaning of that instant did not change. For those present his agony continued for another two hours. Something rattled in his throat, his emaciated body twitched, then the gasping and rattle became less and less frequent.\n\n“It is finished!” said someone near him.\n\nHe heard these words and repeated them in his soul.\n\n“Death is finished,” he said to himself. “It is no more!”\n\nHe drew in a breath, stopped in the midst of a sigh, stretched out, and die", "context_order": 4, "question": "What did Leonid Ivanovich agree to take for his pain when his wife returned late at night?", "answer": "Opium."}

Evening was just closing in and it was raining. I had beenwandering for hours in similar mean streets, always in the rain andalways in evening twilight. Time seemed to have paused on that dismalmoment when only a few shops have lit up and it is not yet dark enoughfor their windows to look cheering. And just as the evening neveradvanced to night, so my walking had never brought me to the better partsof the town. However far I went I found only dingy lodging houses, smalltobacconists, hoardings from which posters hung in rags, windowlesswarehouses, goods stations without trains, and bookshops of the sort thatsell _The Works of Aristotle_. I never met anyone. But for the littlecrowd at the bus stop, the whole town seemed to be empty. I think thatwas why I attached myself to the queue.\n\nI had a stroke of luck right away, for just as I took my stand a littlewaspish woman who would have been ahead of me snapped out at a man whoseemed to be with her, ‘Very well, then. I won’t go at all. So there,’and left the queue. ‘Pray don’t imagine’, said the man, in a verydignified voice, ‘that I care about going in the least. I have only beentrying to please _you_, for peace sake. My own feelings are of course amatter of no importance. I quite understand _that_’—and suiting theaction to the word he also walked away. ‘Come,’ thought I, ‘that’s twoplaces gained.’ I was now next to a very short man with a scowl whoglanced at me with an expression of extreme disfavour and observed,rather unnecessarily loudly, to the man beyond him, ‘This sort of thingreally makes one think twice about going at all.’ ‘What sort of thing?’growled the other, a big beefy person. ‘Well,’ said the Short Man, ‘thisis hardly the sort of society I’m used to as a matter of fact.’ ‘Huh!’said the Hank: and then added with a glance at me, ‘Don’t you standany sauce from _him_, Mister. You’re not _afraid_ of him, are you?’ Then,seeing I made no move, he rounded suddenly on the Short Man and said,‘Not good enough for you, aren’t we? Like your lip.’ Next moment he hadfetched the Short Man one on the side of the face that sent him sprawlinginto the gutter. ‘Let him lay, let him lay,’ said the Hank to no-onein particular. ‘I’m a plain man that’s what I am and I got to have myrights same as anyone else, see?’ As the Short Man showed no dispositionto rejoin the queue and soon began limping away, I closed up, rathercautiously, behind the Hank and congratulated myself on having gainedyet another step. A moment later two young people in front of him alsoleft us arm in arm. They were both so trousered, slender, giggly andfalsetto that I could be sure of the sex of neither, but it was clearthat each for the moment preferred the other to the chance of a place inthe bus. ‘We shall never all get in’, said a female voice with a whine init from some four places ahead of me. ‘Change places with you for fivebob, lady’, said someone else. I heard the clink of money and then ascream in the female voice, mixed with roars of laughter from the rest ofthe crowd. The cheated woman leaped out of her place to fly at the manwho had bilked her, but the others immediately closed up and flung herout. . . . So what with one thing and another the queue had reduceditself to manageable proportions long before the ‘bus appeared.\n\nIt was a wonderful vehicle, blazing with golden light, heraldicallycoloured. The Driver himself seemed full of light and he used only onehand to drive with. The other he waved before his face as if to fan awaythe greasy steam of the rain. A growl went up from the queue as he camein sight. ‘Looks as if _he_ had a good time of it, eh? . . . Bloodypleased with himself, I bet. . . . My dear, why can’t he behave_naturally_?—Thinks himself too good to look at us. . . . Who does heimagine he is? . . . All that gilding and purple, I call it a wickedwaste. Why don’t they spend some of the money on their house propertydown here?—God! I’d like to give him one in the ear-’ole.’ I could seenothing in the countenance of the Driver to justify all this, unless itwere that he had a look of authority and seemed intent on carrying outhis job.\n\nMy fellow passengers fought like hens to get on board the ’bus thoughthere was plenty of room for us all. I was the last to get in. The buswas only half full and I selected a seat at the back, well away from theothers. But a tousle-headed youth at once came and sat down beside me. Ashe did so we moved off.\n\n‘I thought you wouldn’t mind my tacking on to you’, he said, ‘for I’venoticed that you feel just as I do about the present company. Why onearth they insist on coming I can’t imagine. They won’t like it at allwhen we get there, and they’d really be much more comfortable at home.It’s different for you and me.’\n\n‘Do they _like_ this place?’ I asked.\n\n‘As much as they’d like anything,’ he answered. ‘They’ve got cinemas andfish and chip shops and advertisements and all the sorts of things theywant. The appalling lack of any intellectual life doesn’t worry _them_. Irealised as soon as I got here that there’d been some mistake. I ought tohave taken the first bus but I’ve fooled about trying to wake people uphere. I found a few fellows I’d known before and tried to form a littlecircle, but they all seem to have sunk to the level of theirsurroundings. Even before we came here I’d had some doubts about a manlike Randal Quimby. I always thought he was working in a false idiom. Buthe was at least intelligent: one could get some criticism worth hearingfrom him, even if he was a failure on the creative side. But now he seemsto have nothing left but his self conceit. The last time I tried to readhim some of my own stuff . . . but wait a minute, I’d just like you tolook at it.’\n\nRealising with a shudder that what he was producing from his pocket was athick wad of type-written paper, I muttered something about not having myspectacles and exclaimed, ‘Hullo! We’ve left the ground.’\n\nIt was true. Several hundred feet below us, already half hidden in therain and mist, the wet roofs of the town appeared, spreading without abreak as far is the eye could reach.\n\n                                   2.\n\nI was not left very long at the mercy of the Tousle-Headed Poet, becauseanother passenger interrupted our conversation: but before that happenedI had learned a good deal about him. He appeared to be a singularlyill-used man. His parents had never appreciated him and none of the fiveschools at which he had been educated seemed to have made any provisionfor a talent and temperament such as his. To make matters worse he hadbeen exactly the sort of boy in whose case the examination system worksout with the maximum unfairness and absurdity. It was not until hereached the university that he began to recognise that all theseinjustices did not come by chance but were the inevitable results of oureconomic system. Capitalism did not merely enslave the workers, it alsovitiated taste and vulgarised intellect: hence our educational system andhence the lack of ‘Recognition’ for new genius. This discovery had madehim a Communist. But when the war came along and he saw Russia inalliance with the capitalist governments, he had found himself once moreisolated and had to become a conscientious objector. The indignities hesuffered at this stage of his career had, he confessed, embittered him.He decided he could serve the cause best by going to America: but thenAmerica came into the war too. It was at this point that he suddenly sawSweden as the home of a really new and radical art, but the variousoppressors had given him no facilities for going to Sweden. There weremoney troubles. His father, who had never progressed beyond the mostatrocious mental complacency and smugness of the Victorian epoch, wasgiving him a ludicrously inadequate allowance. And he had been very badlytreated by a girl too. He had thought her a really civilised and adultpersonality, and then she had unexpectedly revealed that she was a massof bourgeois prejudices and monogamic instincts. Jealousy,possessiveness, was a quality he particularly disliked. She had evenshown herself, at the end, to be mean about money. That was the laststraw. He had jumped under a train. . . .\n\nI gave a start, but he took no notice.\n\nEven then, he continued, ill luck had continued to dog him. He’d beensent to the grey town. But of course it was a mistake. I would find, heassured me, that all the other passengers would be with me on the returnjourney. But he would not. He was going to stay ‘there’. He felt quitecertain that he was going where, at last, his finely critical spiritwould no longer be outraged by an uncongenial environment—where he wouldfind ‘Recognition’ and ‘Appreciation’. Meanwhile, since I hadn’t got myglasses, he would read me the passage about which Randal Quimby had beenso insensitive. . . .\n\nIt was just then that we were interrupted. One of the quarrels which wereperpetually simmering in the bus had boiled over and for a moment therewas a stampede. Knives were drawn: pistols were fired: but it all seemedstrangely innocuous and when it was over I found myself unharmed, thoughin a different seat and with a new companion. He was anintelligent-looking man with a rather bulbous nose and a bowler hat. Ilooked out of the windows. We were now so high that all below us hadbecome featureless. But fields, rivers, or mountains I did not see, and Igot the impression that the grey town still filled the whole field ofvision.\n\n‘It seems the deuce of a town’, I volunteered, ‘and that’s what I can’tunderstand. The parts of it that I saw were so empty. Was there once amuch larger population?’\n\n‘Not at all’, said my neighbour. ‘The trouble is that they’re soquarrelsome. As soon as anyone arrives he settles in some street. Beforehe’s been there twenty-four hours he quarrels with his neighbour. Beforethe week is over he’s quarrelled so badly that he decides to move. Verylikely he finds the next street empty because all the people there havequarrelled with _their_ neighbours—and moved. If so he settles in. If byany chance the street is full, he goes further. But even if he stays, itmakes no odds. He’s sure to have another quarrel pretty soon and thenhe’ll move on again. Finally he’ll move right out to the edge of the townand build a new house. You see, it’s easy here. You’ve only got to_think_ a house and there it is. That’s how the town keeps on growing.’\n\n‘Leaving more and more empty streets?’\n\n‘That’s right. And time’s sort of odd here. That place where we caughtthe bus is thousands of miles from the Civic Centre where all thenewcomers arrive from earth. All the people you’ve met were living nearthe bus stop: but they’d taken centuries—of our time—to get there, bygradual removals.’\n\n‘And what about the earlier arrivals? I mean—there must be people whocame from earth to your town even longer ago.’\n\n‘That’s right. There are. They’ve been moving on and on. Getting furtherapart. They’re so far off by now that they could never think of coming tothe bus stop at all. Astronomical distances. There’s a bit of risingground near where I live and a chap has a telescope. You can see thelights of the inhabited houses, where those old ones live, millions ofmiles away. Millions of miles from us and from one another. Every now andthen they move further still. That’s one of the disappointments. Ithought you’d meet interesting historical characters. But you don’t:they’re too far away.’\n\n‘Would they get to the bus stop in time, if they ever set out?’\n\n‘Well—theoretically. But it’d be a distance of light-years. And theywouldn’t want to by now: not those old chaps like Tamberlaine and GenghizKhan, or Julius Caesar, or Henry the Fifth.’\n\n‘Wouldn’t want to?’\n\n‘That’s right. The nearest of those old ones is Octavius. We know thatbecause two chaps made the journey to see him. They’d started long beforeI came, of course, but I was there when they came back. About fifteenthousand years of our time it took them. We’ve picked out the house bynow. Just a little pin prick of light and nothing else near it formillions of miles.’\n\n‘But they got there?’\n\n‘That’s right. He’d built himself a huge house all in the Empirestyle—rows of windows flaming with light, though it only shows as a pinprick from where I live.’\n\n‘Did they see Octavius?’\n\n‘That’s right. They went up and looked through one of the windows.Octavius was there all right.’\n\n‘What was he doing?’\n\n‘Walking up and down—up and down all the time—left-right,left-right—never stopping for a moment. The two chaps watched him forabout a year and he never rested. And muttering to himself all the time.“It was Soult’s fault. It was Ney’s fault. It was Josephine’s fault. Itwas the fault of the Russians: It was the fault of the English.” Likethat all the time. Never stopped for a moment. A little, fat man and helooked kind of tired. But he didn’t seem able to stop it.’\n\nFrom the vibrations I gathered that the bus was still moving, but therewas now nothing to be seen from the windows which confirmed this—nothingbut grey void above and below.\n\n‘Then the town will go on spreading indefinitely?’ I said.\n\n‘That’s right,’ said the Vernon. ‘Unless someone can dosomething about it.’\n\n‘How do you mean?’\n\n‘Well, as a matter of fact, between you and me and the wall, that’s myjob at the moment. What’s the trouble about this place? Not that peopleare quarrelsome—that’s only human nature and was always the same even onearth. The trouble is they have no Needs. You get everything you want(not very good quality, of course) by just imagining it. That’s why itnever costs any trouble to move to another street or build another house.In other words, there’s no proper economic basis for any community life.If they needed real shops, chaps would have to stay near where the realshops were. If they needed real houses they’d have to stay near wherebuilders were. It’s scarcity that enables a society to exist. Well,that’s where I come in. I’m not going this trip for my health. As far asthat goes I don’t think it would suit me up there. But if I can come backwith some _real_ commodities—anything at all that you could really biteor drink or sit on—why, at once you’d get a demand down in our town. I’dstart a little business. I’d have something to sell. You’d soon getpeople coming to live near—centralisation. Two fully-inhabited streetswould accommodate the people that are now spread over a million squaremiles of empty streets. I’d make a nice little profit and be a publicbenefactor as well.’\n\n‘You mean, if they _had_ to live together they’d gradually learn toquarrel less?’\n\n‘Well, I don’t know about that. I daresay they could be kept a bitquieter. You’d have a chance to build up a police force. Knock some kindof discipline into them. Anyway’ (here he dropped his voice) ‘it’d be_better_, you know. Everyone admits that. Safety in numbers.’\n\n‘Safety from what?’, I began, but my companion nudged me to be silent. Ichanged my question.\n\n‘But look here’, said I, ‘if they can get everything just by imaginingit, why would they want any _real_ things, as you call them?’\n\n‘Eh? Oh well, they’d like houses that really kept out the rain.’\n\n‘Their present houses, don’t?’\n\n‘Well of course not. How could they?’\n\n‘What the devil is the use of building them, then?’ The Vernonput his head closer to mine. ‘Safety again,’ he muttered. ‘At least, thefeeling of safety. It’s all right _now_: but later on . . . youunderstand.’\n\n‘What?’ said I, almost involuntarily sinking my own voice to a whisper.\n\nHe articulated noiselessly as if expecting that I understood lip-reading.I put my ear close to his mouth. ‘Speak up,’ I said. ‘It will be darkpresently,’ he mouthed.\n\n‘You mean the evening _is_ really going to turn into a night in the end?’\n\nHe nodded.\n\n‘What’s that got to do with it?’ said I.\n\n‘Well . . . no one wants to be out of doors when that happens.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\nHis reply was so furtive that I had to ask him several times to repeatit. When he had done so, being a little annoyed (as one so often is withwhisperers) I replied without remembering to lower my voice.\n\n‘Who are “They”?’ I asked. ‘And what are you afraid they’ll do to you?And why should they come out when it’s dark? And what protection could animaginary house give if there was any danger?’\n\n‘Here!’ shouted the Hank. ‘Who’s talking all that stuff? You stop yourwhispering you two if you don’t want a hiding, see? Spreading rumours,that’s what I call it. You shut your face, Ned, see?’\n\n‘Quite right. Scandalous. Ought to be prosecuted. How did they get intothe bus?’ growled the passengers.\n\nA fat clean-shaven man who sat on the seat in front of me leaned back andaddressed me in a cultured voice.\n\n‘Excuse me,’ he said, ‘but I couldn’t help overhearing parts of yourconversation. It is astonishing how these primitive superstitions lingeron. I beg your pardon? Oh, God bless my soul, that’s all it is. There isnot a shred of evidence that this twilight is ever going to turn into anight. There has been a revolution of opinion on that in educatedcircles. I am surprised that you haven’t heard of it. All the nightmarefantasies of our ancestors are being swept away. What we now see in thissubdued and delicate half-light is the promise of the dawn: the slowturning of a whole nation towards the light. Slow and imperceptible, ofcourse. “And not through Eastern windows only, When daylight comes, comesin the light.” And that passion for “real” commodities which our friendspeaks of is only materialism, you know. It’s retrogressive. Earth-bound!A hankering for matter. But _we_ look on this spiritual city—for with allits faults it _is_ spiritual—as a nursery in which the creative functionsof man, now freed from the clogs of matter, begin to try their wings. Asublime thought.’\n\nHours later there came a change. It began to grow light in the bus. Thegreyness outside the windows turned from mud-colour to mother of pearl,then to faintest blue, then to a bright blueness that stung the eyes. Weseemed to be floating in a pure vacancy. There were no lands, no sun, nostars in sight: only the radiant abyss. I let down the window beside me.Delicious freshness came in for a second, and then—\n\n‘What the hell are you doing?’ shouted the Vernon, leaningroughly across me and pulling the window sharply up. ‘Want us all tocatch our death of cold?’\n\n‘Hit him a biff,’ said the Hank.\n\nI glanced round the bus. Though the windows were closed, and soon muffed,the bus was full of light. It was cruel light. I shrank from the facesand forms by which I was surrounded. They were all fixed faces, full notof possibilities but of impossibilities, some gaunt, some bloated, someglaring with idiotic ferocity, some drowned beyond recovery in dreams;but all, in one way or another, distorted and faded. One had a feelingthat they might fall to pieces at any moment if the light grew muchstronger. Then—there was a mirror on the end wall of the bus—I caughtsight of my own.\n\nAnd still the light grew.\n\n                                   3.\n\nA cliff had loomed up ahead. It sank vertically beneath us so far that Icould not see the bottom, and it was dark and smooth. We were mountingall the time. At last the top of the cliff became visible like a thinline of emerald green stretched tight as a fiddle-string. Presently weglided over that top: we were flying above a level, grassy countrythrough which there ran a wide river. We were losing height now: some ofthe tallest tree tops were only twenty feet below us. Then, suddenly wewere at rest. Everyone had jumped up. Curses, taunts, blows, a filth ofvituperation, came to my ears as my fellow-passengers struggled to getout. A moment later, and they had all succeeded. I was alone in the bus,and through the open door there came to me in the fresh stillness thesinging of a lark.\n\nI got out. The light and coolness that drenched me were like those ofsummer morning, early morning a minute or two before the sunrise, onlythat there was a certain difference. I had the sense of being in a largerspace, perhaps even a larger _sort_ of space, than I had ever knownbefore: as if the sky were further off and the extent of the green plainwider than they could be on this little ball of earth. I had got ‘out’ insome sense which made the Solar System itself seem an indoor affair. Itgave me a feeling of freedom, but also of exposure, possibly of danger,which continued to accompany me through all that followed. It is theimpossibility of communicating that feeling, or even of inducing you toremember it as I proceed, which makes me despair of conveying the realquality of what I saw and heard.\n\nAt first, of course, my attention was caught by my fellow-passengers, whowere still grouped about in the neighbourhood of the omnibus, thoughbeginning, some of them, to walk forward into the landscape withhesitating steps. I gasped when I saw them. Now that they were in thelight, they were transparent—fully transparent when they stood between meand it, smudgy and imperfectly opaque when they stood in the shadow ofsome tree. They were in fact ghosts: man-shaped stains on the brightnessof that air. One could attend to them or ignore them at will as you dowith the dirt on a window pane. I noticed that the grass did not bendunder their feet: even the dew drops were not disturbed.\n\nThen some re-adjustment of the mind or some focussing of my eyes tookplace, and I saw the whole phenomenon the other way round. The men wereas they had always been; as all the men I had known had been perhaps. Itwas the light, the grass, the trees that were different; made of somedifferent substance, so much solider than things in our country that menwere ghosts by comparison. Moved by a sudden thought, I bent down andtried to pluck a daisy which was growing at my feet. The stalk wouldn’tbreak. I tried to twist it, but it wouldn’t twist. I tugged till thesweat stood out on my forehead and I had lost most of the skin off myhands. The little flower was hard, not like wood or even like iron, butlike diamond. There was a leaf—a young tender beech-leaf, lying in thegrass beside it. I tried to pick the leaf up: my heart almost crackedwith the effort, and I believe I did just raise it. But I had to let itgo at once; it was heavier than a sack of coal. As I stood, recovering mybreath with great gasps and looking down at the daisy, I noticed that Icould see the grass not only between my feet but _through_ them. I alsowas a phantom. Who will give me words to express the terror of thatdiscovery? ‘Golly!’ thought I, ‘I’m in for it this time.’\n\n‘I don’t like it! I don’t like it,’ screamed a voice. ‘It gives me thepip!’ One of the ghosts had darted past me, back into the bus. She nevercame out of it again as far as I know.\n\nThe others remained, uncertain.\n\n‘Hi, Mister,’ said the Hank, addressing the Driver, ‘when have we gotto be back?’\n\n‘You need never come back unless you want to,’ he replied. ‘Stay as longas you please.’ There was an awkward pause.\n\n‘This is simply ridiculous,’ said a voice in my ear. One of the quieterand more respectable ghosts had sidled up to me. ‘There must be somemismanagement,’ he continued. ‘What’s the sense of allowing all thatriff-raff to float about here all day? Look at them. They’re not enjoyingit. They’d be far happier at home. They don’t even know what to do.’\n\n‘I don’t know very well myself,’ said I. ‘What does one do?’\n\n‘Oh me? I shall be met in a moment or two. I’m expected. I’m notbothering about that. But it’s rather unpleasant on one’s first day tohave the whole place crowded out with trippers. Damn it, one’s chiefobject in coming here at all was to avoid them!’\n\nHe drifted away from me. And I began to look about. In spite of hisreference to a ‘crowd’, the solitude was so vast that I could hardlynotice the knot of phantoms in the foreground. Greenness and light hadalmost swallowed them up. But very far away I could see what might beeither a great bank of cloud or a range of mountains. Sometimes I couldmake out in it steep forests, far-withdrawing valleys, and even mountaincities perched on inaccessible summits. At other times it becameindistinct. The height was so enormous that my waking sight could nothave taken in such an object at all. Light brooded on the top of it:slanting down thence it made long shadows behind every tree on the plain.There was no change and no progression as the hours passed. Thepromise—or the threat—of sunrise rested immovably up there.\n\nLong after that I saw people coming to meet us. Because they were brightI saw them while they were still very distant, and at first I did notknow that they were people at all. Mile after mile they drew nearer. Theearth shook under their tread as their strong feet sank into the wetturf. A tiny haze and a sweet smell went up where they had crushed thegrass and scattered the dew. Some were naked, some robed. But the nakedones did not seem less adorned, and the robes did not disguise in thosewho wore them the massive grandeur of muscle and the radiant smoothnessof flesh. Some were bearded but no one in that company struck me as beingof any particular age. One gets glimpses, even in our country, of thatwhich is ageless—heavy thought, in the face of an infant, and frolicchildhood in that of a very old man. Here it was all like that. They cameon steadily. I did not entirely like it. Two of the ghosts screamed andran for the bus. The rest of us huddled closer to one another.\n\n                                   4.\n\nAs the solid people came nearer still I noticed that they were movingwith order and determination as though each of them had marked his man inour shadowy company. ‘There are going to be affecting scenes,’ I said tomyself. ‘Perhaps it would not be right to look on.’ With that, I sidledaway on some vague pretext of doing a little exploring. A grove of hugecedars to my right seemed attractive and I entered it. Walking proveddifficult. The grass, hard as diamonds to my unsubstantial feet, made mefeel as if I were walking on wrinkled rock, and I suffered pains likethose of the mermaid in Hans Andersen. A bird ran across in front of meand I envied it. It belonged to that country and was as real as thegrass. It could bend the stalks and spatter itself with the dew.\n\nAlmost at once I was followed by what I have called the Hank—to speakmore accurately, the Big Ghost. He in his turn was followed by one of thebright people. ‘Don’t you know me?’ he shouted to the Ghost: and I foundit impossible not to turn and attend. The face of the solid spirit—he wasone of those that wore a robe—made me want to dance, it was so jocund, soestablished in its youthfulness.\n\n‘Well, I’m damned,’ said the Ghost. ‘I wouldn’t have believed it. It’s afair knock-out. It isn’t right, Milo, you know. What about poor Sam, eh?You look pretty pleased with yourself, but what I say is, What about poorSam?’\n\n‘He is here,’ said the other. ‘You will meet him soon, if you stay.’\n\n‘But you murdered him.’\n\n‘Of course I did. It is all right now.’\n\n‘All right, is it? All right for you, you mean. But what about the poorchap himself, laying cold and dead?’\n\n‘But he isn’t. I have told you, you will meet him soon. He sent you hislove.’\n\n‘What I’d like to understand’, said the Ghost, ‘is what you’re here for,as pleased as Punch, you, a bloody murderer, while I’ve been walking thestreets down there and living in a place like a pigstye all these years.’\n\n‘That is a little hard to understand at first. But it is all over now.You will be pleased about it presently. Till then there is no need tobother about it.’\n\n‘No need to bother about it? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’\n\n‘No. Not as you mean. I do not look at myself. I have given up myself. Ihad to, you know, after the murder. That was what it did for me. And thatwas how everything began.’\n\n‘Personally,’ said the Big Ghost with an emphasis which contradicted theordinary meaning of the word, ‘Personally, I’d have thought you and Iought to be the other way round. That’s my personal opinion.’\n\n‘Very likely we soon shall be,’ said the other. ‘If you’ll stop thinkingabout it.’\n\n‘Look at me, now,’ said the Ghost, slapping its chest (but the slap madeno noise). ‘I gone straight all my life. I don’t say I was a religiousman and I don’t say I had no faults, far from it. But I done my best allmy life, see? I done my best by everyone, that’s the sort of chap I was.I never asked for anything that wasn’t mine by rights. If I wanted adrink I paid for it and if I took my wages I done my job, see? That’s thesort I was and I don’t care who knows it.’\n\n‘It would be much better not to go on about that now.’\n\n‘Who’s going on? I’m not arguing. I’m just telling you the sort of chap Iwas, see? I’m asking for nothing but my rights. You may think you can putme down because you’re dressed up like that (which you weren’t when youworked under me) and I’m only a poor man. But I got to have my rightssame as you, see?’\n\n‘Oh no. It’s not so bad as that. I haven’t got my rights, or I should notbe here. You will not get yours either. You’ll get something far better.Never fear.’\n\n‘That’s just what I say. I haven’t got my rights. I always done my bestand I never done nothing wrong. And what I don’t see is why I should beput below a bloody murderer like you.’\n\n‘Who knows whether you will be? Only be happy and come with me.’\n\n‘What do you keep on arguing for? I’m only telling you the sort of chap Iam. I only want my rights. I’m not asking for anybody’s bleedingcharity.’\n\n‘Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here forthe asking and nothing can be bought.’\n\n‘That may do very well for you, I daresay. If they choose to let in abloody murderer all because he makes a poor mouth at the last moment,that’s their look out. But I don’t see myself going in the same boat withyou, see? Why should I? I don’t want charity. I’m a decent man and if Ihad my rights I’d have been here long ago and you can tell them I saidso.’\n\nThe other shook his head. ‘You can never do it like that,’ he said. ‘Yourfeet will never grow hard enough to walk on our grass that way. You’d betired out before we got to the mountains. And it isn’t exactly true, youknow.’ Mirth danced in his eyes as he said it.\n\n‘What isn’t true?’ asked the Ghost sulkily.\n\n‘You weren’t a decent man and you didn’t do your best. We none of us wereand we none of us did. Lord bless you, it doesn’t matter. There is noneed to go into it all now.’\n\n‘You!’ gasped the Ghost. ‘_You_ have the face to tell _me_ I wasn’t adecent chap?’\n\n‘Of course. Must I go into all that? I will tell you one thing to beginwith. Murdering old Sam wasn’t the worst thing I did. That was the workof a moment and I was half mad when I did it. But I murdered you in myheart, deliberately, for years. I used to lie awake at nights thinkingwhat I’d do to you if ever I got the chance.

I was the worst. But all the menwho worked under you felt the same.

Because I’m not taking any impudence from you about my privateaffairs.’\n\n‘There are no private affairs,’ said the other.\n\n‘And I’ll tell you another thing,’ said the Ghost. ‘You can clear off,see?

You will never get there alone. And I am the one who wassent to you.’\n\n‘So that’s the trick, is it?’ shouted the Ghost, outwardly bitter, andyet I thought there was a kind of triumph in its voice. It had beenentreated: it could make a refusal: and this seemed to it a kind ofadvantage. ‘I thought there’d be some damned nonsense. It’s all a clique,all a bloody clique. Tell them I’m not coming, see? I’d rather be damnedthan go along with you. I came here to get my rights, see? Not to gosnivelling along on charity tied onto your apron-strings.

Two velvet-footed lions came bouncing into the openspace, their eyes fixed upon each other, and started playing some solemnromp. Their manes looked as if they had been just dipped in the riverwhose noise I could hear close at hand, though the trees hid it. Notgreatly liking my company, I moved away to find that river, and afterpassing some thick flowering bushes, I succeeded. The bushes came almostdown to the brink. It was as smooth as Thames but flowed swiftly like amountain stream: pale green where trees overhung it but so clear that Icould count the pebbles at the bottom. Close beside me I saw another ofthe Bright People in conversation with a ghost. It was that fat ghostwith the cultured voice who had addressed me in the bus, and it seemed tobe wearing gaiters.\n\n‘My dear boy, I’m delighted to see you,’ it was saying to the Spirit, whowas naked and almost blindingly white. ‘I was talking to your poor fatherthe other day and wondering where you were.’\n\n‘You didn’t bring him?’ said the other.\n\n‘Well, no. He lives a long way from the bus, and, to be quite frank, he’sbeen getting a little eccentric lately. A little difficult. Losing hisgrip. He never was prepared to make any great efforts, you know. If youremember, he used to go to sleep when you and I got talking seriously!Ah, Charlie, I shall never forget some of our talks. I expect you’ve changedyour views a bit since then. You became rather narrow-minded towards theend of your life: but no doubt you’ve broadened out again.’\n\n‘How do you mean?’\n\n‘Well, it’s obvious by now, isn’t it, that you weren’t quite right. Why,my dear boy, you were coming to believe in a literal Heaven and Hell!’\n\n‘But wasn’t I right?’\n\n‘Oh, in a spiritual sense, to be sure. I still believe in them in thatway. I am still, my dear boy, looking for the Kingdom. But nothingsuperstitious or mythological. . . .’\n\n‘Excuse me. Where do you imagine you’ve been?’\n\n‘Ah, I see. You mean that the grey town with its continual hope ofmorning (we must all live by hope, must we not?), with its field forindefinite progress, is, in a sense, Heaven, if only we have eyes to seeit? That is a beautiful idea.’\n\n‘I didn’t mean that at all. Is it possible you don’t know where you’vebeen?’\n\n‘Now that you mention it, I don’t think we ever do give it a name. Whatdo you call it?’\n\n‘We call it Hell.’\n\n‘There is no need to be profane, my dear boy. I may not be very orthodox,in your sense of that word, but I do feel that these matters ought to bediscussed simply, and seriously, and reverently.’\n\n‘Discuss Hell _reverently_? I meant what I said. You have been in Hell:though if you don’t go back you may call it Purgatory.’\n\n‘Go on, my dear boy, go on. That is _so_ like you. No doubt you’ll tellme why, on your view, I was sent there. I’m not angry.’\n\n‘But don’t you know? You went there because you are an apostate.’\n\n‘Are you serious, Charlie?’\n\n‘Perfectly.’\n\n‘This is worse than I expected. Do you really think people are penalisedfor their honest opinions? Even assuming, for the sake of argument, thatthose opinions were mistaken.’\n\n‘Do you really think there are no sins of intellect?’\n\n‘There are indeed, Charlie. There is hide-bound prejudice, and intellectualdishonesty, and timidity, and stagnation. But honest opinions fearlesslyfollowed—they are not sins.’\n\n‘I know we used to talk that way. I did it too until the end of my lifewhen I became what you call narrow. It all turns on what are honestopinions.’\n\n‘Mine certainly were. They were not only honest but heroic. I assertedthem fearlessly. When the doctrine of the Resurrection ceased to commenditself to the critical faculties which God had given me, I openlyrejected it. I preached my famous sermon. I defied the whole chapter. Itook every risk.’\n\n‘What risk? What was at all likely to come of it except what actuallycame—popularity, sales for your books, invitations, and finally abishopric?’\n\n‘Charlie, this is unworthy of you. What are you suggesting?’\n\n‘Friend, I am not suggesting at all. You see, I _know_ now. Let us befrank. Our opinions were not honestly come by. We simply found ourselvesin contact with a certain current of ideas and plunged into it because itseemed modern and successful. At College, you know, we just startedautomatically writing the kind of essays that got good marks and sayingthe kind of things that won applause. When, in our whole lives, did wehonestly face, in solitude, the one question on which all turned: whetherafter all the Supernatural might not in fact occur? When did we put upone moment’s real resistance to the loss of our faith?’\n\n‘If this is meant to be a sketch of the genesis of liberal theology ingeneral, I reply that it is a mere libel. Do you suggest that men like. ..’\n\n‘I have nothing to do with any generality. Nor with any man but you andme. Oh, as you love your own soul, remember. You know that you and I wereplaying with loaded dice. We didn’t _want_ the other to be true. We wereafraid of crude salvationism, afraid of a breach with the spirit of theage, afraid of ridicule, afraid (above all) of real spiritual fears andhopes.’\n\n‘I’m far from denying that young men may make mistakes. They may well beinfluenced by current fashions of thought. But it’s not a question of howthe opinions are formed. The point is that they were my honest opinions,sincerely expressed.’\n\n‘Of course. Having allowed oneself to drift, unresisting, unpraying,accepting every half-conscious solicitation from our desires, we reacheda point where we no longer believed the Faith. Just in the same way, ajealous man, drifting and unresisting, reaches a point at which hebelieves lies about his best friend: a drunkard reaches a point at which(for the moment) he actually believes that another glass will do him noharm. The beliefs are sincere in the sense that they do occur aspsychological events in the man’s mind. If that’s what you mean bysincerity they are sincere, and so were ours. But errors which aresincere in that sense are not innocent.’\n\n‘You’ll be justifying the Inquisition in a moment!’\n\n‘Why? Because the Middle Ages erred in one direction, does it follow thatthere is no error in the opposite direction?’\n\n‘Well, this is extremely interesting,’ said the Episcopal Ghost. ‘It’s apoint of view. Certainly, it’s a point of view. In the meantime. . .’\n\n‘There is no meantime,’ replied the other. ‘All that is over. We are notplaying now. I have been talking of the past (your past and mine) only inorder that you may turn from it forever. One wrench and the tooth will beout. You can begin as if nothing had ever gone wrong. White as snow. It’sall true, you know. He is in me, for you, with that power. And—I havecome a long journey to meet you. You have seen Hell: you are in sight ofHeaven. Will you, even now, repent and believe?’\n\n‘I’m not sure that I’ve got the exact point you are trying to make,’ saidthe Ghost.\n\n‘I am not trying to make any point,’ said the Spirit. ‘I am telling youto repent and believe.’\n\n‘But my dear boy, I believe already. We may not be perfectly agreed, butyou have completely misjudged me if you do not realise that my religionis a very real and a very precious thing to me.’\n\n‘Very well,’ said the other, as if changing his plan. ‘Will you believein _me_?’\n\n‘In what sense?’\n\n‘Will you come with me to the mountains? It will hurt at first, untilyour feet are hardened. Reality is harsh to the feet of shadows. But willyou come?’\n\n‘Well, that is a plan. I am perfectly ready to consider it. Of course Ishould require some assurances . . . I should want a guarantee that youare taking me to a place where I shall find a wider sphere ofusefulness—and scope for the talents that God has given me—and anatmosphere of free inquiry—in short, all that one means by civilisationand—er—the spiritual life.’\n\n‘No,’ said the other. ‘I can promise you none of these things. No sphereof usefulness: you are not needed there at all. No scope for yourtalents: only forgiveness for having perverted them. No atmosphere ofinquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but ofanswers, and you shall see the face of God.’\n\n‘Ah, but we must all interpret those beautiful words in our own way! Forme there is no such thing as a final answer. The free wind of inquirymust _always_ continue to blow through the mind, must it not? “Prove allthings” . . . to travel hopefully is better than to arrive.’\n\n‘If that were true, and known to be true, how could anyone travelhopefully? There would be nothing to hope for.’\n\n‘But you must feel yourself that there is something stifling about theidea of finality? Stagnation, my dear boy, what is more soul-destroyingthan stagnation?’\n\n‘You think that, because hitherto you have experienced truth only withthe abstract intellect. I will bring you where you can taste it likehoney and be embraced by it as by a bridegroom. Your thirst shall bequenched.’\n\n‘Well, really, you know, I am not aware of a thirst for some ready-madetruth which puts an end to intellectual activity in the way you seem tobe describing. Will it leave me the free play of Mind, Charlie? I mustinsist on that, you know.’\n\n‘Free, as a man is free to drink while he is drinking. He is not freestill to be dry.’ The Spirit seemed to think for a moment. ‘I can makenothing of that idea,’ it said.\n\n‘Listen!’ said the White Spirit. ‘Once you were a child. Once you knewwhat inquiry was for. There was a time when you asked questions becauseyou wanted answers, and were glad when you had found them. Become thatchild again: even now.’\n\n‘Ah, but when I became a man I put away childish things.’\n\n‘You have gone far wrong. Thirst was made for water; inquiry for truth.What you now call the free play of inquiry has neither more nor less todo with the ends for which intelligence was given you than masturbationhas to do with marriage.’\n\n‘If we cannot be reverent, there is at least no need to be obscene. Thesuggestion that I should return at my age to the mere factualinquisitiveness of boyhood strikes me as preposterous. In any case, thatquestion-and-answer conception of thought only applies to matters offact. Religious and speculative questions are surely on a differentlevel.’\n\n‘We know nothing of religion here: we think only of Christ. We knownothing of speculation. Come and see. I will bring you to Eternal Fact,the Father of all other facthood.’\n\n‘I should object very strongly to describing God as a “fact”. The SupremeValue would surely be a less inadequate description. It is hardly. . . .’\n\n‘Do you not even believe that He exists?’\n\n‘Exists? What does Existence mean? You _will_ keep on implying some sortof static, ready-made reality which is, so to speak, “there”, and towhich our minds have simply to conform. These great mysteries cannot beapproached in that way. If there were such a thing (there is no need tointerrupt, my dear boy) quite frankly, I should not be interested in it.It would be of no _religious_ significance. God, for me, is somethingpurely spiritual. The spirit of sweetness and light and tolerance—and,er, service, Charlie, service. We mustn’t forget that, you know.’\n\n‘If the thirst of the Reason is really dead . . .’, said the Spirit, andthen stopped as though pondering. Then suddenly he said, ‘Can you, atleast, still desire happiness?’\n\n‘Happiness, my dear Charlie,’ said the Ghost placidly, ‘happiness, as youwill come to see when you are older, lies in the path of duty. Whichreminds me. . . . Bless my soul, I’d nearly forgotten. Of course I can’tcome with you. I have to be back next Friday to read a paper. We have alittle Theological Society down there. Oh yes! there is plenty ofintellectual life. Not of a very high quality, perhaps. One notices acertain lack of grip—a certain confusion of mind. That is where I can beof some use to them. There are even regrettable jealousies. . . . I don’tknow why, but tempers seem less controlled than they used to be. Still,one mustn’t expect too much of human nature. I feel I can do a great workamong them. But you’ve never asked me what my paper is about! I’m takingthe text about growing up to the measure of the stature of Christ andworking out an idea which I feel sure you’ll be interested in. I’m goingto point out how people always forget that Jesus (here the Ghost bowed)was a comparatively young man when he died. He would have outgrown someof his earlier views, you know, if he’d lived. As he might have done,with a little more tact and patience. I am going to ask my audience toconsider what his mature views would have been. A profoundly interestingquestion. What a different Christianity we might have had if only theFounder had reached his full stature! I shall end up by pointing out howthis deepens the significance of the Crucifixion. One feels for the firsttime what a disaster it was: what a tragic waste . . . so much promisecut short. Oh, must you be going? Well, so must I. Goodbye, my dear boy.It has been a great pleasure. Most stimulating and provocative. Goodbye,goodbye, goodbye.’\n\nThe Spirit nodded its head and beamed on the Spirit with a bright clericalsmile—or with the best approach to it which such unsubstantial lips couldmanage—and then turned away humming softly to itself ‘City of God, howbroad and far.’\n\nBut I did not watch him long, for a new idea had just occurred to me. Ifthe grass were hard as rock, I thought, would not the water be hardenough to walk on? I tried it with one foot, and my foot did not go in.Next moment I stepped boldly out on the surface. I fell on my face atonce and got some nasty bruises. I had forgotten that though it was, tome, solid, it was not the less in rapid motion. When I had picked myselfup I was about thirty yards further down-stream than the point where Ihad left the bank. But this did not prevent me from walking up-stream: itonly meant that by walking very fast indeed I made very little progress.\n\n                                   6.\n\nThe cool smooth skin of the bright water was delicious to my feet and Iwalked on it for about an hour, making perhaps a couple of hundred yards.Then the going became different. The current grew swifter. Great flakesor islands of foam came swirling down towards me, bruising my shins likestones if I did not get out of their way. The surface became uneven,rounded itself into lovely hollows and elbows of water which distortedthe appearance of the pebbles on the bottom and threw me off my balance,so that I had to scramble to shore. But as the banks hereabouts consistedof great flat stones, I continued my journey without much hurt to myfeet. An immense yet lovely noise vibrated through the forest. Hourslater I rounded a bend and saw the explanation.\n\nBefore me green slopes made a wide amphitheatre, enclosing a frothy andpulsating lake into which, over many-coloured rocks, a waterfall waspouring. Here once again I realised that something had happened to mysenses so that they were now receiving impressions which would normallyexceed their capacity. On earth, such a waterfall could not have beenperceived at all as a whole; it was too big. Its sound would have been aterror in the woods for twenty miles. Here, after the first shock, mysensibility ‘took’ both as a well-built ship takes a huge wave. Iexulted. The noise, though gigantic, was like giants’ laughter: like therevelry of a whole college of giants together laughing, dancing, singing,roaring at their high works.\n\nNear the place where the fall plunged into the lake there grew a tree.Wet with the spray, half-veiled in foam-bows, flashing with the bright,innumerable birds that flew among its branches, it rose in many shapes ofbillowy foliage, huge as a fen-land cloud. From every point apples ofgold gleamed through the leaves.\n\nSuddenly my attention was diverted by a curious appearance in theforeground. A hawthorn bush not twenty yards away seemed to be behavingoddly. Then I saw that it was not the bush but something standing closeto the bush and on this side of it. Finally I realised that it was one ofthe Ghosts. It was crouching as if to conceal itself from somethingbeyond the bush, and it was looking back at me and making signals. Itkept on signing to me to duck down. As I could not see what the dangerwas, I stood fast.\n\nPresently the Ghost, after peering around in every direction, venturedbeyond the hawthorn bush. It could not get on very fast because of thetorturing grasses beneath its feet, but it was obviously going as fast asit possibly could, straight for another tree. There it stopped again,standing straight upright against the trunk as though it were takingcover. Because the shadow of the branches now covered it, I could see itbetter: it was my bowler-hatted companion, the one whom the Big Ghost hadcalled Ned. After it had stood panting at the tree for about ten minutesand carefully reconnoitred the ground ahead, it made a dash for anothertree—such a dash as was possible to it. In this way, with infinite labourand caution, it had reached the great Tree in about an hour. That is, ithad come within ten yards of it.\n\nHere it was checked. Round the Tree grew a belt of lilies: to the Ghostan insuperable obstacle. It might as well have tried to tread down ananti-tank trap as to walk _on_ them. It lay down and tried to crawlbetween them but they grew too close and they would not bend. And all thetime it was apparently haunted by the terror of discovery. At everywhisper of the wind it stopped and cowered: once, at the cry of a bird,it struggled back to its last place of cover: but then desire hounded itout again and it crawled once more to the Tree. I saw it clasp its handsand writhe in the agony of its frustration.\n\nThe wind seemed to be rising. I saw the Ghost wring its hand and put itsthumb into its mouth—cruelly pinched, I doubt not, between two stems ofthe lilies when the breeze swayed them. Then came a real gust. Thebranches of the Tree began to toss. A moment later and half a dozenapples had fallen round the Ghost and on it. He gave a sharp cry, butsuddenly checked it. I thought the weight of the golden fruit where ithad fallen on him would have disabled him: and certainly, for a fewminutes, he was unable to rise. He lay whimpering, nursing his wounds.But soon he was at work again. I could see him feverishly trying to fillhis pockets with the apples. Of course it was useless. One could see howhis ambitions were gradually forced down. He gave up the idea of apocketful: two would have to do. He gave up the idea of two, he wouldtake one, the largest one. He gave up that hope. He was now looking forthe smallest one. He was trying to find if there was one small enough tocarry.\n\nThe amazing thing was that he succeeded. When I remembered what the leafhad felt like when I tried to lift it, I could hardly help admiring thisunhappy creature when I saw him rise staggering to his feet actuallyholding the smallest of the apples in his hands. He was lame from hishurts, and the weight bent him double. Yet even so, inch by inch, stillavailing himself of every scrap of cover, he set out on his _viadolorosa_ to the bus, carrying his torture.\n\n‘Fool. Put it down,’ said a great voice suddenly. It was quite unlike anyother voice I had heard so far. It was a thunderous yet liquid voice.With an appalling certainty I knew that the waterfall itself wasspeaking: and I saw now (though it did not cease to look like awaterfall) that it was also a bright angel who stood, like one crucified,against the rocks and poured himself perpetually down towards the forestwith loud joy.\n\n‘Fool,’ he said, ‘put it down. You cannot take it back. There is not roomfor it in Hell. Stay here and learn to eat such apples. The very leavesand the blades of grass in the wood will delight to teach you.’\n\nWhether the Ghost heard or not, I don’t know. At any rate, after pausingfor a few minutes, it braced itself anew for its agonies and continuedwith even greater caution till I lost sight of it.\n\n                                   7.\n\nAlthough I watched the misfortunes of the Ghost in the Bowler with somecomplacency, I found, when we were left alone, that I could not bear thepresence of the Water-Giant. It did not appear to take any notice of me,but I became self-conscious; and I rather think there was some assumednonchalance in my movements as I walked away over the flat rocks,down-stream again. I was beginning to be tired. Looking at the silverfish which darted over the riverbed, I wished greatly that to me alsothat water were permeable. I should have liked a dip.\n\n‘Thinking of going back?’ said a voice close at hand. I turned and saw atall ghost standing with its back against a tree, chewing a ghostlycheroot. It was that of a lean hard-bitten man with grey hair and agruff, but not uneducated voice: the kind of man I have alwaysinstinctively felt to be reliable.\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said I. ‘Are you?’\n\n‘Yes,’ it replied. ‘I guess I’ve seen about all there is to see.’\n\n‘You don’t think of staying?’\n\n‘That’s all propaganda,’ it said. ‘Of course there never was any questionof our staying. You can’t eat the fruit and you can’t drink the water andit takes you all your time to walk on the grass. A human being couldn’tlive here. All that idea of staying is only an advertisement stunt.’\n\n‘Then why did you come?’\n\n‘Oh, I don’t know. Just to have a look round. I’m the sort of chap wholikes to see things for himself. Wherever I’ve been I’ve always had alook at anything that was being cracked up. When I was out East, I wentto see Pekin. When . . .’\n\n‘What was Pekin like?’\n\n‘Nothing to it. Just one darn wall inside another. Just a trap fortourists. I’ve been pretty well everywhere. Niagara Falls, the Pyramids,Salt Lake City, the Taj Mahal. . . .’\n\n‘What was _it_ like?’\n\n‘Not worth looking at. They’re all advertisement stunts. All run by thesame people. There’s a combine, you know, a World Combine, that justtakes an Atlas and decides where they’ll have a Sight. Doesn’t matterwhat they choose: anything’ll do as long as the publicity’s properlymanaged.’\n\n‘And you’ve lived—er—_down there_—in the Town—for some time?’\n\n‘In what they call Hell? Yes. It’s a flop too. They lead you to expectred fire and devils and all sorts of interesting people sizzling ongrids—Henry VIII and all that—but when you get there it’s just like anyother town.’\n\n‘I prefer it up here,’ said I.\n\n‘Well, I don’t see what all the talk is about,’ said the Hard-BittenGhost. ‘It’s as good as any other park to look at, and darneduncomfortable.’\n\n‘There seems to be some idea that if one stays here one would get—well,solider—grow acclimatised.’\n\n‘I know all about that,’ said the Ghost. ‘Same old lie. People have beentelling me that sort of thing all my life. They told me in the nurserythat if I were good I’d be happy. And they told me at school that Latinwould get easier as I went on. After I’d been married a month some foolwas telling me that there were always difficulties at first, but withTact and Patience I’d soon “settle down” and like it! And all through twowars what didn’t they say about the good time coming if only I’d be abrave boy and go on being shot at? Of course they’ll play the old gamehere if anyone’s fool enough to listen.’\n\n‘But who are “They”? This might be run by someone different?’\n\n‘Entirely new management, eh? Don’t you believe it! It’s _never_ a newmanagement. You’ll always find the same old Ring. I know all about dear,kind Mummie coming up to your bedroom and getting all she wants to knowout of you: but you always found she and Father were the same firmreally. Didn’t we find that both sides in all the wars were run by thesame Armament Firms? or the same Firm, which is behind the Jews and theVatican and the Dictators and the Democracies and all the rest of it. Allthis stuff up here is run by the same people as the Town. They’re justlaughing at us.’\n\n‘I thought they were at war?’\n\n‘Of course you did. That’s the official version. But who’s ever seen anysigns of it? Oh, I know that’s how they _talk_. But if there’s a real warwhy don’t they do anything? Don’t you see that if the official versionwere true these chaps up here would attack and sweep the Town out ofexistence? They’ve got the strength. If they wanted to rescue _us_ theycould do it. But obviously the last thing they want is to end theirso-called “war”. The whole game depends on keeping it going.’\n\nThis account of the matter struck me as uncomfortably plausible. I saidnothing.\n\n‘Anyway,’ said the Ghost, ‘who wants to be rescued? What the hell wouldthere be to _do_ here?’\n\n‘Or there?’ said I.\n\n‘Quite,’ said the Ghost. ‘They’ve got you either way.’\n\n‘What would you like to do if you had your choice?’ I asked.\n\n‘There you go!’ said the Ghost with a certain triumph. ‘Asking _me_ tomake a plan. It’s up to the Management to find something that doesn’tbore us, isn’t it? It’s their job. Why should we do it for them? That’sjust where all the parsons and moralists have got the thing upside down.They keep on asking _us_ to alter ourselves. But if the people who runthe show are so clever and so powerful, why don’t they find something tosuit their public? All this poppycock about growing harder so that thegrass doesn’t hurt our feet, now! There’s an example. What would you sayif you went to a hotel where the eggs were all bad; and when youcomplained to the Boss, instead of apologising and changing his dairyman,he just told you that if you tried you’d get to like bad eggs in time?’\n\n‘Well, I’ll be getting along,’ said the Ghost after a short silence. ‘Youcoming my way?’\n\n‘There doesn’t seem to be much point in going anywhere on your showing,’I replied. A great depression had come over me. ‘And at least it’s notraining here.’\n\n‘Not at the moment,’ said the Hard-Bitten Ghost. ‘But I never saw one ofthese bright mornings that didn’t turn to rain later on. And, by gum,when it does rain here! Ah, you hadn’t thought of that? It hadn’toccurred to you that with the sort of water they have here every raindropwill make a hole in you, like a machine-gun bullet. That’s their littlejoke, you see. First of all tantalise you with ground you can’t walk onand water you can’t drink and then drill you full of holes. But theywon’t catch _me_ that way.’\n\nA few minutes later he moved off.\n\n                                   8.\n\nI sat still on a stone by the river’s side feeling as miserable as I everfelt in my life. Hitherto it had not occurred to me to doubt theintentions of the Solid People, nor to question the essential goodness oftheir country even if it were a country which I could not long inhabit.It had indeed once crossed my mind that if these Solid People were asbenevolent as I had heard one or two of them claim to be, they might havedone something to help the inhabitants of the Town—something more thanmeeting them on the plain. Now a terrible explanation came into my mind.How if they had never meant to do us good at all? How if this whole tripwere allowed the Ghosts merely to mock them? Horrible myths and doctrinesstirred in my memory. I thought how the Gods had punished Tantalus. Ithought of the place in the Book of Revelation where it says that thesmoke of Hell goes up forever in the sight of the blessed spirits. Iremembered how poor Cowper, dreaming that he was not after all doomed toperdition, at once knew the dream to be false and said, ‘These are thesharpest arrows in His quiver.’ And what the Hard-Bitten Ghost had saidabout the rain was clearly true. Even a shower of dew-drops from a branchmight tear me in pieces. I had not thought of this before. And how easilyI might have ventured into the spray of the waterfall!\n\nThe sense of danger, which had never been entirely absent since I leftthe bus, awoke with sharp urgency. I gazed around on the trees, theflowers, and the talking cataract: they had begun to look unbearablysinister. Bright insects darted to and fro. If one of those were to flyinto my face, would it not go right through me? If it settled on my head,would it crush me to earth? Terror whispered, ‘This is no place for you.’I remembered also the lions.\n\nWith no very clear plan in my mind, I rose and began walking away fromthe river in the direction where the trees grew closest together. I hadnot fully made up my mind to go back to the bus, but I wanted to avoidopen places. If only I could find a trace of evidence that it was reallypossible for a Ghost to stay—that the choice was not only a cruelcomedy—I would not go back. In the meantime I went on, gingerly, andkeeping a sharp look-out. In about half an hour I came to a littleclearing with some bushes in the centre. As I stopped, wondering if Idared cross it, I realised that I was not alone.\n\nA Ghost hobbled across the clearing—as quickly as it could on that uneasysoil—looking over its shoulder as if it were pursued. I saw that it hadbeen a woman: a well-dressed woman, I thought, but its shadows of fin", "context_order": 1, "question": "What does the Spirit say the Ghost must do in order to find forgiveness and begin anew?", "answer": "Repent and believe."}

Itcould not really get in among them—the twigs and leaves were too hard—butit pressed as close up against them as it could. It seemed to believe itwas hiding.\n\nA moment later I heard the sound of feet, and one of the Bright Peoplecame in sight: one always noticed that sound there, for we Ghosts made nonoise when we walked.\n\n‘Go away!’ squealed the Ghost. ‘Go away! Can’t you see I want to bealone?’\n\n‘But you need help,’ said the Solid One.\n\n‘If you have the least trace of decent feeling left,’ said the Ghost,‘you’ll keep away. I don’t want help. I want to be left alone. Do goaway. You know I can’t walk fast enough on those horrible spikes to getaway from you. It’s abominable of you to take advantage.’\n\n‘Oh, that!’ said the Spirit. ‘That’ll soon come right. But you’re goingin the wrong direction. It’s back there—to the mountains—you need to go.You can lean on me all the way. I can’t absolutely _carry_ you, but youneed have almost no weight on your own feet: and it will hurt less atevery step.’\n\n‘I’m not afraid of being hurt. You know that.’\n\n‘Then what is the matter?’\n\n‘Can’t you understand _anything_? Do you really suppose I’m going outthere among all those people, like _this_?’\n\n‘But why not?’\n\n‘I’d never have come at all if I’d known you were all going to be dressedlike that.’\n\n‘Friend, you see I’m not dressed at all.’\n\n‘I didn’t mean that. Do go away.’\n\n‘But can’t you even tell me?’\n\n‘If you can’t understand, there’d be no good trying to explain it. How_can_ I go out like this among a lot of people with real solid bodies?It’s far worse than going out with nothing on would have been on earth.Have everyone staring _through_ me.’\n\n‘Oh, I see. But we were all a bit ghostly when we first arrived, youknow. That’ll wear off. Just come out and try.’\n\n‘But they’ll _see_ me.’\n\n‘What does it matter if they do?’\n\n‘I’d rather die.’\n\n‘But you’ve died already. There’s no good trying to go back to that.’\n\nThe Spirit made a sound something between a sob and a snarl. ‘I wish I’dnever been born,’ it said. ‘What _are_ we born for?’\n\n‘For infinite happiness,’ said the Spirit. ‘You can step out into it atany moment. . . .’\n\n‘But, I tell you, they’ll _see_ me.’\n\n‘An hour hence and you will not care. A day hence and you will laugh atit. Don’t you remember on earth—there were things too hot to touch withyour finger but you could drink them all right? Shame is like that. Ifyou will accept it—if you will drink the cup to the bottom—you will findit very nourishing: but try to do anything else with it and it scalds.’\n\n‘You really mean? . . .’ said the Ghost, and then paused. My suspense wasstrained up to the height. I felt that my own destiny hung on her reply.I could have fallen at her feet and begged her to yield.\n\n‘Yes,’ said the Spirit. ‘Come and try.’\n\nAlmost, I thought the Ghost had obeyed. Certainly it had moved: butsuddenly it cried out, ‘No, I can’t. I tell you I can’t. For a moment,while you were talking, I almost thought . . . but when it comes to thepoint. . . . You’ve no right to ask me to do a thing like that. It’sdisgusting. I should never forgive myself if I did. Never, never. Andit’s not fair. They ought to have warned us. I’d never have come. Andnow—please, please go away!’\n\n‘Friend,’ said the Spirit. ‘Could you, only for a moment, fix your mindon something not yourself?’\n\n‘I’ve already given you my answer,’ said the Ghost, coldly but stilltearful.\n\n‘Then only one expedient remains,’ said the Spirit, and to my greatsurprise he set a horn to his lips and blew. I put my hands over my ears.The earth seemed to shake: the whole wood trembled and dindled at thesound. I suppose there must have been a pause after that (though thereseemed to be none) before I heard the thudding of hoofs—far off at first,but already nearer before I had well identified it, and soon so near thatI began to look about for some place of safety. Before I had found onethe danger was all about us. A herd of unicorns came thundering throughthe glades: twenty-seven hands high the smallest of them and white asswans but for the red gleam in eyes and nostrils and the flashing indigoof their horns. I can still remember the squelching noise of the soft wetturf under their hoofs, the breaking of the undergrowth, the snorting andthe whinneyings; how their hind legs went up and their horned heads downin mimic battle. Even then I wondered for what real battle it might bethe rehearsal. I heard the Ghost scream, and I think it made a bolt awayfrom the bushes . . . perhaps towards the Spirit, but I don’t know. Formy own nerve failed and I fled, not heeding, for the moment, the horriblegoing underfoot, and not once daring to pause. So I never saw the end ofthat interview.\n\n                                   9.\n\n‘Where are ye going?’ said a voice with a strong Scotch accent. I stoppedand looked. The sound of the unicorns had long since died away and myflight had brought me to open country, I saw the mountains where theunchanging sunrise lay, and in the foreground two or three pines on alittle knoll, with some large smooth rocks, and heather. On one of therocks sat a very tall man, almost a giant, with a flowing beard. I hadnot yet looked one of the Solid People in the face. Now, when I did so, Idiscovered that one sees them with a kind of double vision. Here was anenthroned and shining god, whose ageless spirit weighed upon mine like aburden of solid gold: and yet, at the very same moment, here was an oldweather-beaten man, one who might have been a shepherd—such a man astourists think simple because he is honest and neighbours think ‘deep’for the same reason. His eyes had the far-seeing look of one who haslived long in open, solitary places; and somehow I divined the network ofwrinkles which must have surrounded them before re-birth had washed himin immortality.\n\n‘I—I don’t quite know,’ said I.\n\n‘Ye can sit and talk to me, then,’ he said, making room for me on thestone.\n\n‘I don’t know you, Sir,’ said I, taking my seat beside him.\n\n‘My name is George,’ he answered. ‘Alastair Green.’\n\n‘Oh!’ I cried. ‘Then you can tell me! You at least will not deceive me.’Then, supposing that these expressions of confidence needed someexplanation, I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writingshad done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon atLeatherhead Station when I first bought a copy of _Phantastes_ (beingthen about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight ofBeatrice had been to Dante: _Here begins the New Life_. I started toconfess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imaginationmerely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that hisChristendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I hadtried not to see that the true name of the quality which first met me inhis books is Holiness. He laid his hand on mine and stopped me.\n\n‘Son,’ he said, ‘Your love—all love—is of inexpressible value to me. Butit may save precious time’ (here he suddenly looked very Scotch) ‘if Iinform ye that I am already well acquainted with these biographicaldetails. In fact, I have noticed that your memory misleads you in one ortwo particulars.’\n\n‘Oh!’ said I, and became still.\n\n‘Ye had started’, said my Teacher, ‘to talk of something moreprofitable.’\n\n‘Sir,’ said I, ‘I had almost forgotten it, and I have no anxiety aboutthe answer now, though I have still a curiosity. It is about theseGhosts. _Do_ any of them stay? _Can_ they stay? Is any real choiceoffered to them? How do they come to be here?’\n\n‘Did ye never hear of the _Refrigerium_? A man with your advantages mighthave read of it in Prudentius, not to mention William Harris.’\n\n‘The name is familiar, Sir, but I’m afraid I’ve forgotten what it means.’\n\n‘It means that the damned have holidays—excursions, ye understand.’\n\n‘Excursions to _this_ country?’\n\n‘For those that will take them. Of course most of the silly creaturesdon’t. They prefer taking trips back to Earth. They go and play tricks onthe poor daft women ye call mediums. They go and try to assert theirownership of some house that once belonged to them: and then ye getwhat’s called a Haunting. Or they go to spy on their children. Orliterary ghosts hang about public libraries to see if anyone’s stillreading their books.’\n\n‘But if they come here they can really stay?’\n\n‘Aye. Ye’ll have heard that the emperor Antoninus did.’\n\n‘But I don’t understand. Is judgement not final? Is there really a wayout of Hell into Heaven?’\n\n‘It depends on the way ye’re using the words. If they leave that greytown behind it will not have been Hell. To any that leaves it, it isPurgatory. And perhaps ye had better not call this country Heaven. Not_Deep Heaven_, ye understand.’ (Here he smiled at me). ‘Ye can call itthe Valley of the Shadow of Life. And yet to those who stay here it willhave been Heaven from the first. And ye can call those sad streets in thetown yonder the Valley of the Shadow of Death: but to those who remainthere they will have been Hell even from the beginning.’\n\nI suppose he saw that I looked puzzled, for presently he spoke again.\n\n‘Son,’ he said, ‘ye cannot in your present state understand eternity:when Thalos looked through the door of the Timeless he brought no messageback. But ye can get some likeness of it if ye say that both good andevil, when they are full grown, become retrospective. Not only thisvalley but all their earthly past will have been Heaven to those who aresaved. Not only the twilight in that town, but all their life on earthtoo, will then be seen by the damned to have been Hell. That is whatmortals misunderstand. They say of some temporal suffering, “No futurebliss can make up for it,” not knowing that Heaven, once attained, willwork backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinfulpleasure they say “Let me but have _this_ and I’ll take theconsequences”: little dreaming how damnation will spread back and backinto their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin. Both processesbegin even before death. The good man’s past begins to change so that hisforgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: thebad man’s past already conforms to his badness and is filled only withdreariness. And that is why, at the end of all things, when the sun riseshere and the twilight turns to blackness down there, the Blessed will say“We have never lived anywhere except in Heaven”, and the Lost, “We werealways in Hell.” And both will speak truly.’\n\n‘Is not that very hard, Sir?’\n\n‘I mean, that is the real sense of what they will say. In the actuallanguage of the Lost, the words will be different, no doubt. One will sayhe has always served his country right or wrong; and another that he hassacrificed everything to his Art; and some that they’ve never been takenin, and some that, thank God, they’ve always looked after Number One, andnearly all, that, at least they’ve been true to themselves.’\n\n‘And the Saved?’\n\n‘Ah, the Saved . . . what happens to them is best described as theopposite of a mirage. What seemed, when they entered it, to be the valeof misery turns out, when they look back, to have been a well; and wherepresent experience saw only salt deserts memory truthfully records thatthe pools were full of water.’\n\n‘Then those people are right who say that Heaven and Hell are only statesof mind?’\n\n‘Hush,’ said he sternly. ‘Do not blaspheme. Hell is a state of mind—yenever said a truer word. And every state of mind, left to itself, everyshutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in theend, Hell. But Heaven is not a state of mind. Heaven is reality itself.All that is fully real is Heavenly. For all that can be shaken will beshaken and only the unshakeable remains.’\n\n‘But there is a real choice after death? My Roman Catholic friends wouldbe surprised, for to them souls in Purgatory are already saved. And myProtestant friends would like it no better, for they’d say that the treelies as it falls.’\n\n‘They’re both right, maybe. Do not fash yourself with such questions. Yecannot fully understand the relations of choice and Time till you arebeyond both. And ye were not brought here to study such curiosities. Whatconcerns you is the nature of the choice itself: and that ye can watchthem making.’\n\n‘Well, Sir,’ I said, ‘That also needs explaining. What do they choose,these souls who go back (I have yet seen no others)? And how _can_ theychoose it?’\n\n‘Byron was right,’ said my Teacher. ‘The choice of every lost soul canbe expressed in the words “Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.”There is always something they insist on keeping, even at the price ofmisery. There is always something they prefer to joy—that is, to reality.Ye see it easily enough in a spoiled child that would sooner miss itsplay and its supper than say it was sorry and be friends. Ye call it theSulks. But in adult life it has a hundred fine names—Patroclus’ wrath andFabius’ grandeur, Revenge and Injured Merit and Self-Respect andTragic Greatness and Proper Pride.’\n\n‘Then is no one lost through the undignified vices, Sir? Through meresensuality?’\n\n‘Some are, no doubt. The sensualist, I’ll allow ye, begins by pursuing areal pleasure, though a small one. His sin is the less. But the timecomes on when, though the pleasure becomes less and less and the cravingfiercer and fiercer, and though he knows that joy can never come thatway, yet he prefers to joy the mere fondling of unappeasable lust andwould not have it taken from him. He’d fight to the death to keep it.He’d like well to be able to scratch: but even when he can scratch nomore he’d rather itch than not.’\n\nHe was silent for a few minutes, and then began again.\n\n‘Ye’ll understand, there are innumerable forms of this choice. Sometimesforms that one hardly thought of at all on earth. There was a creaturecame here not long ago and went back—Sir Lionel they called him. Inhis earthly life he’d been interested in nothing but Survival. He’dwritten a whole shelf-full of books about it. He began by beingphilosophical, but in the end he took up Psychical Research. It grew tobe his only occupation—experimenting, lecturing, running a magazine. Andtravelling too: digging out queer stories among Thibetan lamas and beinginitiated into brotherhoods in Central Africa. Proofs—and more proofs—andthen more proofs again—were what he wanted. It drove him mad if ever hesaw anyone taking an interest in anything else. He got into troubleduring one of your wars for running up and down the country telling themnot to fight because it wasted a lot of money that ought to be spent onResearch. Well, in good time, the poor creature died and came here: andthere was no power in the universe would have prevented him staying andgoing on to the mountains. But do ye think that did him any good? Thiscountry was no use to him at all. Everyone here had “survived” already.Nobody took the least interest in the question. There was nothing more toprove. His occupation was clean gone. Of course if he would only haveadmitted that he’d mistaken the means for the end and had a good laugh athimself he could have begun all over again like a little child andentered into joy. But he would not do that. He cared nothing about joy.In the end he went away.’\n\n‘How fantastic!’ said I.\n\n‘Do ye think so?’ said the Teacher with a piercing glance. ‘It is nearerto such as you than ye think. There have been men before now who got sointerested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothingfor God Himself . . . as if the good Lord had nothing to do but exist!There have been some who were so occupied in spreading Christianity thatthey never gave a thought to Christ. Man! Ye see it in smaller matters.Did ye never know a lover of books that with all his first editions andsigned copies had lost the power to read them? Or an organiser ofcharities that had lost all love for the poor? It is the subtlest of allthe snares.’\n\nMoved by a desire to change the subject, I asked why the Solid People,since they were full of love, did not go down into Hell to rescue theGhosts. Why were they content simply to meet them on the plain? One wouldhave expected a more militant charity.\n\n‘Ye will understand that better, perhaps before ye go,’ said he. ‘In themeantime, I must tell ye they have come further for the sake of theGhosts than ye can understand. Every one of us lives only to journeyfurther and further into the mountains. Every one of us has interruptedthat journey and retraced immeasurable distances to come down to-day onthe mere chance of saving some Ghost. Of course it is also joy to do so,but ye cannot blame us for that! And it would be no use to come furthereven if it were possible. The sane would do no good if they madethemselves mad to help madmen.’\n\n‘But what of the poor Ghosts who never get into the omnibus at all?’\n\n‘Everyone who wishes it does. Never fear. There are only two kinds ofpeople in the end: those who say to God, “Thy will be done,” and those towhom God says, in the end, “_Thy_ will be done.” All that are in Hell,choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul thatseriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seekfind. To those who knock it is opened.’\n\nAt this moment we were suddenly interrupted by the thin voice of a Ghosttalking at an enormous speed. Looking behind us we saw the creature. Itwas addressing one of the Solid People and was doing so too busily tonotice us. Every now and then the Solid Spirit tried to get in a word butwithout success. The Spirit’s talk was like this:\n\n‘Oh, my dear, I’ve had such a dreadful time, I don’t know how I ever gothere at all, I was coming with Marian Clay and we’d arranged the wholething and we were to meet at the corner of Sink Street; I made itperfectly plain because I knew what she was like and if I told her once Itold her a hundred times I would _not_ meet her outside that dreadfulMarjoribanks woman’s house, not after the way she’d treated me . . . thatwas one of the most dreadful things that happened to me; I’ve been dyingto tell you because I felt sure you’d tell me I acted rightly; no, wait amoment, dear, till I’ve told you—I tried living with her when I firstcame and it was all fixed up, she was to do the cooking and I was to lookafter the house and I _did_ think I was going to be comfortable after allI’d been through but she turned out to be so changed, absolutely selfish,and not a particle of sympathy for anyone but herself—and as I once saidto her “I _do_ think I’m entitled to a little consideration because youat least lived out your time, but I oughtn’t to have been here for yearsand years yet”—oh but of course I’m forgetting you don’t know—I wasmurdered, simply murdered, dear, that man should never have operated, Iought to be alive to-day and they simply _starved_ me in that dreadfulnursing home and no one ever came near me and . . .’\n\nThe shrill monotonous whine died away as the speaker still accompanied bythe bright patience at her side, moved out of hearing.\n\n‘What troubles ye, son?’ asked my Teacher.\n\n‘I am troubled, Sir,’ said I, ‘because that unhappy creature doesn’t seemto me to be the sort of soul that ought to be even in danger ofdamnation. She isn’t wicked: she’s only a silly, garrulous old woman whohas got into a habit of grumbling, and one feels that a little kindness,and rest, and change would put her all right.’\n\n‘That is what she once was. That is maybe what she still is. If so, shecertainly will be cured. But the whole question is whether she _is_ now agrumbler.’\n\n‘I should have thought there was no doubt about that!’\n\n‘Aye, but ye misunderstand me. The question is whether she is a grumbler,or only a grumble. If there is a real woman—even the least trace ofone—still there inside the grumbling, it can be brought to life again. Ifthere’s one wee spark under all those ashes, we’ll blow it till the wholepile is red and clear. But if there’s nothing but ashes we’ll not go onblowing them in our own eyes forever. They must be swept up.’\n\n‘But how can there be a grumble without a grumbler?’\n\n‘The whole difficulty of understanding Hell is that the thing to beunderstood is so nearly Nothing. But ye’ll have had experiences . . . itbegins with a grumbling mood, and yourself still distinct from it:perhaps criticising it. And yourself, in a dark hour, may will that mood,embrace it. Ye can repent and come out of it again. But there may come aday when you can do that no longer. Then there will be no _you_ left tocriticise the mood, nor even to enjoy it, but just the grumble itselfgoing on forever like a machine. But come! Ye are here to watch andlisten. Lean on my arm and we will go for a little walk.’\n\nI obeyed. To lean on the arm of someone older than myself was anexperience that carried me back to childhood, and with this support Ifound the going tolerable: so much so, indeed, that I flattered myself myfeet were already growing more solid, until a glance at the poortransparent shapes convinced me that I owed all this ease to the strongarm of the Teacher. Perhaps it was because of his presence that my othersenses also appeared to be quickened. I noticed scents in the air whichhad hitherto escaped me, and the country put on new beauties. There waswater everywhere and tiny flowers quivering in the early breeze. Far offin the woods we saw the deer glancing past, and, once, a sleek panthercame purring to my companion’s side. We also saw many of the Ghosts.\n\nI think the most pitiable was a female Ghost. Her trouble was the veryopposite of that which afflicted the other, the lady frightened by theUnicorns. This one seemed quite unaware of her phantasmal appearance.More than one of the Solid People tried to talk to her, and at first Iwas quite at a loss to understand her behaviour to them. She appeared tobe contorting her all but invisible face and writhing her smokelike bodyin a quite meaningless fashion. At last I came to theconclusion—incredible as it seemed—that she supposed herself stillcapable of attracting them and was trying to do so. She was a thing thathad become incapable of conceiving conversation save as a means to thatend. If a corpse already liquid with decay had arisen from the coffin,smeared its gums with lipstick, and attempted a flirtation, the resultcould not have been more appalling. In the end she muttered ‘Stupidcreatures’, and turned back to the bus.\n\nThis put me in mind to ask my Teacher what he thought of the affair withthe Unicorns. ‘It will maybe have succeeded,’ he said. ‘Ye will havedivined that he meant to frighten her; not that fear itself could makeher less a Ghost, but if it took her mind a moment off herself, theremight, in that moment, be a chance. I have seen them saved so.’\n\nWe met several Ghosts that had come so near to Heaven only in order totell the Celestials about Hell. Indeed this is one of the commonesttypes. Others, who had perhaps been (like myself) teachers of some kindactually wanted to give lectures about it: they brought fat notebooksfull of statistics, and maps, and (one of them) a magic lantern. Somewanted to tell anecdotes of the notorious sinners of all ages whom theyhad met below. But the most part seemed to think that the mere fact ofhaving contrived for themselves so much misery gave them a kind ofsuperiority. ‘You have led a sheltered life!’ they bawled. ‘You don’tknow the seamy side. We’ll tell you. We’ll give you some hard facts’—asif to tinge Heaven with infernal images and colours had been the onlypurpose for which they came. All alike, so far as I could judge from myown exploration of the lower world, were wholly unreliable, and allequally incurious about the country in which they had arrived. Theyrepelled every attempt to teach them, and when they found that nobodylistened to them they went back, one by one, to the bus.\n\nThis curious wish to describe Hell turned out, however, to be only themildest form of a desire very common among the Ghosts—the desire to_extend_ Hell, to bring it bodily, if they could, into Heaven. There weretub-thumping Ghosts who in thin, bat-like voices urged the blessedspirits to shake off their fetters, to escape from their imprisonment inhappiness, to tear down the mountains with their hands, to seize Heaven‘for their own’: Hell offered her co-operation. There were planningGhosts who implored them to dam the river, cut down the trees, kill theanimals, build a mountain railway, smooth out the horrible grass and mossand heather with asphalt. There were materialistic Ghosts who informedthe immortals that they were deluded: there was no life after death, andthis whole country was a hallucination. There were Ghosts, plain andsimple: mere bogies, fully conscious of their own decay, who had acceptedthe traditional rôle of the spectre, and seemed to hope they couldfrighten someone. I had had no idea that this desire was possible. But myTeacher reminded me that the pleasure of frightening is by no meansunknown on earth, and also of Cassius’ saying: ‘They terrify lest theyshould fear.’ When the _débris_ of a decayed human soul finds itselfcrumbled into ghosthood and realises ‘I myself am now that which allhumanity has feared, I am just that cold churchyard shadow, that horriblething which cannot be, yet somehow is’, then to terrify others appears toit an escape from the doom of being a Ghost yet still fearingGhosts—fearing even the Ghost it is. For to be afraid of oneself is thelast horror.\n\nBut, beyond all these, I saw other grotesque phantoms in which hardly atrace of the human form remained; monsters who had faced the journey tothe bus stop—perhaps for them it was thousands of miles—and come up tothe country of the Shadow of Life and limped far into it over thetorturing grass, only to spit and gibber out in one ecstasy of hatredtheir envy and (what is harder to understand) their contempt, of joy. Thevoyage seemed to them a small price to pay if once, only once, withinsight of that eternal dawn, they could tell the prigs, the toffs, thesanctimonious humbugs, the snobs, the ‘haves’, what they thought of them.\n\n‘How do they come to be here at all?’ I asked my Teacher.\n\n‘I have seen that kind converted’, said he, ‘when those ye would thinkless deeply damned have gone back. Those that hate goodness are sometimesnearer than those that know nothing at all about it and think they haveit already.’\n\n‘Whisht, now!’ said my Teacher suddenly. We were standing close to somebushes and beyond them I saw one of the Solid People and a Ghost who hadapparently just that moment met. The outlines of the Ghost looked vaguelyfamiliar, but I soon realized that what I had seen on earth was not theman himself but photographs of him in the papers. He had been a famousartist.\n\n‘God!’ said the Ghost, glancing round the landscape.\n\n‘God what?’ asked the Spirit.\n\n‘What do you mean, “God what”?’ asked the Ghost.\n\n‘In our grammar _God_ is a noun.’\n\n‘Oh—I see. I only meant “By Gum” or something of the sort. I meant . . .well, all _this_. It’s . . . it’s . . . I should like to paint this.’\n\n‘I shouldn’t bother about that just at present if I were you.’\n\n‘Look here; isn’t one going to be allowed to go on painting?’\n\n‘Looking comes first.’\n\n‘But I’ve had my look. I’ve seen just what I want to do. God!—I wish I’dthought of bringing my things with me!’\n\nThe Spirit shook his head, scattering light from his hair as he did so.‘That sort of thing’s no good here,’ he said.\n\n‘What do you mean?’ said the Ghost.\n\n‘When you painted on earth—at least in your earlier days—it was becauseyou caught glimpses of Heaven in the earthly landscape. The success ofyour painting was that it enabled others to see the glimpses too. Buthere you are having the thing itself. It is from here that the messagescame. There is no good _telling_ us about this country, for we see italready. In fact we see it better than you do.’\n\n‘Then there’s never going to be any point in painting here?’\n\n‘I don’t say that. When you’ve grown into a Person (it’s all right, weall had to do it) there’ll be some things which you’ll see better thananyone else. One of the things you’ll want to do will be to tell us aboutthem. But not yet. At present your business is to see. Come and see. Heis endless. Come and feed.’\n\nThere was a little pause. ‘That will be delightful,’ said the Ghostpresently in a rather dull voice.\n\n‘Come, then,’ said the Spirit, offering it his arm.\n\n‘How soon do you think I _could_ begin painting?’ it asked.\n\nThe Spirit broke into laughter. ‘Don’t you see you’ll never paint at allif that’s what you’re thinking about?’ he said.\n\n‘What do you mean?’ asked the Ghost.\n\n‘Why, if you are interested in the country only for the sake of paintingit, you’ll never learn to see the country.’\n\n‘But that’s just how a real artist _is_ interested in the country.’\n\n‘No. You’re forgetting,’ said the Spirit. ‘That was not how you began.Light itself was your first love: you loved paint only as a means oftelling about light.’\n\n‘Oh, that’s ages ago,’ said the Ghost. ‘One grows out of that. Of course,you haven’t seen my later works. One becomes more and more interested inpaint for its own sake.’\n\n‘One does, indeed. I also have had to recover from that. It was all asnare. Ink and catgut and paint were necessary down there, but they arealso dangerous stimulants. Every poet and musician and artist, but forGrace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of thetelling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at allbut only in what they say about Him. For it doesn’t stop at beinginterested in paint, you know. They sink lower—become interested in theirown personalities and then in nothing but their own reputations.’\n\n‘I don’t think I’m much troubled in _that_ way,’ said the Ghost stiffly.\n\n‘That’s excellent,’ said the Spirit. ‘Not many of us had quite got overit when we first arrived. But if there is any of that inflammation leftit will be cured when you come to the fountain.’\n\n‘What fountain’s that?’\n\n‘It is up there in the mountains,’ said the Spirit. ‘Very cold and clear,between two green hills. A little like Lethe. When you have drunk of ityou forget forever all proprietorship in your own works. You enjoy themjust as if they were someone else’s: without pride and without modesty.’\n\n‘That’ll be grand,’ said the Ghost without enthusiasm.\n\n‘Well, come,’ said the Spirit: and for a few paces he supported thehobbling shadow forward to the East.\n\n‘Of course,’ said the Ghost, as if speaking to itself, ‘there’ll alwaysbe interesting people to meet. . . .’\n\n‘Everyone will be interesting.’\n\n‘Oh—ah—yes, to be sure. I was thinking of people in our own line. Shall Imeet Julian? Or Monet? Or——.’\n\n‘Sooner or later—if they’re here.’\n\n‘But don’t you know?’\n\n‘Well, of course not. I’ve only been here a few years.

They are all known, remembered, recognised by theonly Mind that can give a perfect judgement.’\n\n‘Oh, of course, in _that_ sense. . . .’ said the Ghost.\n\n‘Don’t stop,’ said the Spirit, making to lead him still forward.\n\n‘One must be content with one’s reputation among posterity, then,’ saidthe Ghost.\n\n‘My friend,’ said the Spirit. ‘Don’t you know?’\n\n‘Know what?’\n\n‘That you and I are already completely forgotten on the Earth?’\n\n‘Eh? What’s that?’ exclaimed the Ghost, disengaging its arm. ‘Do you meanthose damned Neo-Regionalists have won after all?’\n\n‘Lord love you, yes!’ said the Spirit, once more shaking and shining withlaughter. ‘You couldn’t get five pounds for any picture of mine or evenof yours in Europe or America to-day. We’re dead out of fashion.’\n\n‘I must be off at once,’ said the Ghost. ‘Let me go! Damn it all, one hasone’s duty to the future of Art. I must go back to my friends. I mustwrite an article. There must be a manifesto. We must start a periodical.We must have publicity. Let me go. This is beyond a joke!’\n\nAnd without listening to the Spirit’s reply, the spectre vanished.\n\n                                  10.\n\nThis conversation also we overheard.\n\n‘That is quite, _quite_ out of the question,’ said a female Ghost to oneof the bright Women, ‘I should not dream of staying if I’m expected tomeet Oliver. I am ready to forgive him, of course. But anything more isquite impossible. How he comes to be here . . . but that is your affair.’\n\n‘But if you have forgiven him,’ said the other, ‘surely——.’\n\n‘I forgive him as a Christian,’ said the Ghost. ‘But there are somethings one can never forget.’\n\n‘But I don’t understand. . . .’ began the She-Spirit.\n\n‘Exactly,’ said the Ghost with a little laugh. ‘You never did. You alwaysthought Oliver could do no wrong. I know. Please don’t interrupt for_one_ moment. You haven’t the faintest conception of what I went throughwith your dear Oliver. The ingratitude! It was I who made a man of him!Sacrificed my whole life to him! And what was my reward? Absolute, utterselfishness. No, but listen. He was pottering along on about six hundreda year when I married him. And mark my words, Dorothy, he’d have been inthat position to the day of his death if it hadn’t been for me. It was Iwho had to drive him every step of the way. He hadn’t a spark ofambition. It was like trying to lift a sack of coal. I had to positivelynag him to take on that extra work in the other department, though it wasreally the beginning of everything for him. The laziness of men! He said,if you please, he couldn’t work more than thirteen hours a day! As if Iweren’t working far longer. For _my_ day’s work wasn’t over when his was.I had to keep him going all evening, if you understand what I mean. Ifhe’d had his way he’d have just sat in an armchair and sulked when dinnerwas over. It was I who had to draw him out of himself and brighten him upand make conversation. With no help from him, of course. Sometimes hedidn’t even listen. As I said to him, I should have thought good manners,if nothing else . . . he seemed to have forgotten that I was a lady evenif I _had_ married him, and all the time I was working my fingers to thebone for him: and without the slightest appreciation. I used to spendsimply _hours_ arranging flowers to make that poky little house nice, andinstead of thanking me, what do you think he said? Said he wished Iwouldn’t fill up the writing desk with them when he wanted to use it: andthere was a perfectly frightful fuss one evening because I’d spilled oneof the vases over some papers of his. It was all nonsense really, becausethey weren’t anything to do with his work. He had some silly idea ofwriting a book in those days . . . as if he could. I cured him of that inthe end.\n\n‘No, Dorothy, you _must_ listen to me. The trouble I went to, entertaining!Oliver’s idea was that he’d just slink off by himself every now and thento see what he called his old friends . . . and leave me to amuse myself!But I knew from the first that those friends were doing him no good. “No,Oliver,” said I, “your friends are now mine. It is my duty to have them_here_, however tired I am and however little we can afford it.” You’dhave thought that would have been enough. But they did come for a bit.That is where I had to use a certain amount of tact. A woman who has herwits about her can always drop in a word here and there. I wanted Oliverto see them against a different background. They weren’t quite at theirease, somehow, in my drawing-room: not at their best. I couldn’t helplaughing sometimes. Of course Oliver was uncomfortable while thetreatment was going on, but it was all for his own good in the end. Noneof that set were friends of his any longer by the end of the first year.\n\n‘And then, he got the new job. A great step up. But what _do_ you think?Instead of realising that we now had a chance to spread out a bit, all hesaid was “Well _now_, for God’s sake let’s have some peace.” That nearlyfinished me. I nearly gave him up altogether: but I knew my duty. I havealways done my duty. You can’t believe the work I had getting him toagree to a bigger house, and then finding a house. I wouldn’t havegrudged it one scrap if only he’d taken it in the right spirit—if onlyhe’d seen the _fun_ of it all. If he’d been a different sort of man it_would_ have been fun meeting him on the doorstep as he came back fromthe office and saying “Come along, Oliver, no time for dinner to-night.I’ve just heard of a house out near Watford and I’ve got the keys and wecan get there and back by one o’clock.” But with _him_! It was perfectmisery, Dorothy. For by this time your wonderful Oliver was turning intothe sort of man who cares about nothing but food.\n\n‘Well, I got him into the new house at last. Yes, I know. It was a littlemore than we could really afford at the moment, but all sorts of thingswere opening out before him. And, of course, I began to entertainproperly. No more of his sort of friends, thank you. I was doing it allfor his sake. Every useful friend he ever made was due to me. Naturally,I had to dress well. They ought to have been the happiest years of bothour lives. If they weren’t, he had no one but himself to thank. Oh, hewas a maddening man, simply maddening! He just set himself to get old andsilent and grumpy. Just sank into himself. He could have looked yearsyounger if he’d taken the trouble. He needn’t have walked with astoop—I’m sure I warned him about that often enough. He was the mostmiserable host. Whenever we gave a party everything rested on myshoulders: Oliver was simply a wet blanket. As I said to him (and if Isaid it once, I said it a hundred times) he hadn’t always been like that.There had been a time when he took an interest in all sorts of things andhad been quite ready to make friends. “What on earth is coming over you?”I used to say. But now he just didn’t answer at all. He would sit staringat me with his great big eyes (I came to hate a man with dark eyes) and—Iknow it now—just hating me. That was my reward. After all I’d done. Sheerwicked, senseless hatred: at the very moment when he was a richer manthan he’d ever dreamed of being! As I used to say to him, “Oliver, you’resimply letting yourself go to seed.” The younger men who came to thehouse—it wasn’t _my_ fault if they liked me better than my old bear of ahusband—used to laugh at him.\n\n‘I did my duty to the very end. I _forced_ him to take exercise—that wasreally my chief reason for keeping a great Dane. I kept on givingparties. I took him for the most wonderful holidays. I saw that he didn’tdrink too much. Even, when things became desperate, I encouraged him totake up his writing again. It couldn’t do any harm by then. How could Ihelp it if he _did_ have a nervous breakdown in the end? My conscience isclear. I’ve done my duty by him, if ever a woman has. So you see why itwould be impossible to. . . .\n\n‘And yet . . . I don’t know. I believe I have changed my mind. I’ll makethem a fair offer, Dorothy. I will _not_ meet him, if it means just meetinghim and no more. But if I’m given a free hand I’ll take charge of himagain. I will take up my burden once more. But I must have a free hand.With all the time one would have here, I believe I could still makesomething of him. Somewhere quite to ourselves. Wouldn’t that be a goodplan? He’s not fit to be on his own. Put me in charge of him. He wantsfirm handling. I know him better than you do. What’s that? No, give himto me, do you hear? Don’t consult _him_: just give him to me. I’m hiswife, aren’t I? I was only beginning. There’s lots, lots, lots of thingsI still want to do with him. No, listen, Dorothy. Please, please! I’m somiserable. I must have someone to—to do things to. It’s simply frightfuldown there. No one minds about me at all. I can’t alter them. It’sdreadful to see them all sitting about and not be able to do anythingwith them. Give him back to me. Why should he have everything his ownway? It’s not good for him. It isn’t right, it’s not fair. I want Oliver.What right have you to keep him from me? I hate you. How can I pay himout if you won’t let me have him?’\n\nThe Spirit which had towered up like a dying candle-flame snappedsuddenly. A sour, dry smell lingered in the air for a moment and thenthere was no Ghost to be seen.\n\n                                  11.\n\nOne of the most painful meetings we witnessed was between a woman’s Ghostand a Bright Spirit who had apparently been her brother. They must havemet only a moment before we ran across them, for the Ghost was justsaying in a tone of unconcealed disappointment, ‘Oh . . . Percival! It’s_you_, is it?’\n\n‘Yes, dear,’ said the Spirit. ‘I know you expected someone else. Can you. . . I hope you can be a little glad to see even me; for the present.’\n\n‘I did think Ewan would have come,’ said the Ghost; and then, almostfiercely, ‘He _is_ here, of course?’\n\n‘He’s there—far up in the mountains.’\n\n‘Why hasn’t he come to meet me? Didn’t he know?’\n\n‘My dear (don’t worry, it will all come right presently) it wouldn’t havedone. Not yet. He wouldn’t be able to see or hear you as you are atpresent. You’d be totally invisible to Ewan. But we’ll soon build youup.’\n\n‘I should have thought if _you_ can see me, my own son could!’\n\n‘It doesn’t always happen like that. You see, I have specialised in thissort of work.’\n\n‘Oh, it’s work, is it?’ snapped the Ghost. Then, after a pause, ‘Well.When _am_ I going to be allowed to see him?’\n\n‘There’s no question of being _allowed_, Nora. As soon as it’s possiblefor him to see you, of course he will. You need to be thickened up abit.’\n\n‘How?’ said the Ghost. The monosyllable was hard and a littlethreatening.\n\n‘I’m afraid the first step is a hard one,’ said the Spirit. ‘But afterthat you’ll go on like a house on fire. You will become solid enough forEwan to perceive you when you learn to want Someone Else besidesEwan. I don’t say “more than Ewan”, not as a beginning. That willcome later. It’s only the little germ of a desire for God that we need tostart the process.’\n\n‘Oh, you mean religion and all that sort of thing? This is hardly themoment . . . and from _you_, of all people. Well, never mind. I’ll dowhatever’s necessary. What do you want me to do? Come on. The sooner Ibegin it, the sooner they’ll let me see my boy. I’m quite ready.’\n\n‘But, Nora, do think! Don’t you see you are not beginning at all as longas you are in that state of mind? You’re treating God only as a means toEwan. But the whole thickening treatment consists in learning to wantGod for His own sake.’\n\n‘You wouldn’t talk like that if you were a mother.’\n\n‘You mean, if I were _only_ a mother. But there is no such thing as beingonly a mother. You exist as Ewan’s mother only because you first existas God’s creature. That relation is older and closer. No, listen, Nora! Healso loves. He also has suffered. He also has waited a long time.’\n\n‘If He loved me He’d let me see my boy. If He loved me why did He takeEwan away from me? I wasn’t going to say anything about that. But it’spretty hard to forgive, you know.’\n\n‘But He had to take Ewan away. Partly for Ewan’s sake. . . .’\n\n‘I’m sure I did my best to make Ewan happy. I gave up my whole life. .. .’\n\n‘Human beings can’t make one another really happy for long. And secondly,for your sake. He wanted your merely instinctive love for your child(tigresses share _that_, you know!) to turn into something better. Hewanted you to love Ewan as He understands love. You cannot love afellow-creature fully till you love God. Sometimes this conversion can bedone while the instinctive love is still gratified. But there was, itseems, no chance of that in your case. The instinct was uncontrolled andfierce and monomaniac. (Ask your daughter, or your husband. Ask our ownmother. You haven’t once thought of _her_.) The only remedy was to takeaway its object. It was a case for surgery. When that first kind of lovewas thwarted, then there was just a chance that in the loneliness, in thesilence, something else might begin to grow.’\n\n‘This is all nonsense—cruel and wicked nonsense. What _right_ have you tosay things like that about Mother-love? It is the highest and holiestfeeling in human nature.’\n\n‘Nora, Nora—no natural feelings are high or low, holy or unholy, inthemselves. They are all holy when God’s hand is on the rein. They all gobad when they set up on their own and make themselves into false gods.’\n\n‘My love for Ewan would never have gone bad. Not if we’d livedtogether for millions of years.’\n\n‘You are mistaken. And you must know. Haven’t you met—down there—motherswho have their sons with them, in Hell? Does _their_ love make themhappy?’\n\n‘If you mean people like the Guthrie woman and her dreadful Bobby, ofcourse not. I hope you’re not suggesting. . . . If I had Ewan I’d beperfectly happy, even in that town. I wouldn’t be always talking abouthim till everyone hated the sound of his name, which is what WinifredGuthrie does about _her_ brat. I wouldn’t quarrel with people for nottaking enough notice of him and then be furiously jealous if they did. Iwouldn’t go about whining and complaining that he wasn’t nice to me.Because, of course, he would be nice. Don’t you dare to suggest thatEwan could ever become like the Guthrie boy. There are some things Iwon’t stand.’\n\n‘What you have seen in the Guthries is what natural affection turns to inthe end if it will not be converted.’\n\n‘It’s a lie. A wicked, cruel lie. How could anyone love their son morethan I did? Haven’t I lived only for his memory all these years?’\n\n‘That was rather a mistake, Nora. In your heart of hearts you know itwas.’\n\n‘What was a mistake?’\n\n‘All that ten years’ ritual of grief. Keeping his room exactly as he’dleft it: keeping anniversaries: refusing to leave that house though Charlieand Iris were both wretched there.’\n\n‘Of course they didn’t care. I know that. I soon learned to expect noreal sympathy from them.’\n\n‘You’re wrong. No man ever felt his son’s death more than Charlie. Not manygirls loved their brothers better than Iris. It wasn’t against Ewanthey revolted: it was against you—against having their whole lifedominated by the tyranny of the past: and not really even Ewan’s past,but your past.’\n\n‘You are heartless. Everyone is heartless. The past was all I had.’\n\n‘It was all you chose to have. It was the wrong way to deal with asorrow. It was Egyptian—like embalming a dead body.’\n\n‘Oh, of course. I’m wrong. Everything I say or do is wrong, according toyou.’\n\n‘But of course!’ said the Spirit, shining with love and mirth so that myeyes were dazzled. ‘That’s what we all find when we reach this country.We’ve all been wrong! That’s the great joke. There’s no need to go onpretending one was right! After that we begin living.’\n\n‘How dare you laugh about it? Give me my boy. Do you hear? I don’t careabout all your rules and regulations. I don’t believe in a God who keepsmother and son apart. I believe in a God of love. No one has a right tocome between me and my son. Not even God. Tell Him that to His face. Iwant my boy, and I mean to have him. He is mine, do you understand? Mine,mine, mine, for ever and ever.’\n\n‘He will be, Nora. Everything will be yours. God Himself will be yours.But not that way. Nothing can be yours by nature.’\n\n‘What? Not my own son, born out of my own body?’\n\n‘And where is your own body now? Didn’t you know that Nature draws to anend? Look! The sun is coming, over the mountains there: it will be up anymoment now.’\n\n‘Ewan is mine.’\n\n‘How yours? You didn’t make him. Nature made him to grow in your bodywithout your will. Even against your will . . . you sometimes forget thatyou didn’t intend to have a baby then at all. Ewan was originally anAccident.’\n\n‘Who told you that?’ said the Ghost: and then, recovering itself, ‘It’s alie. It’s not true. And it’s no business of yours. I hate your religionand I hate and despise your God. I believe in a God of Love.’\n\n‘And yet, Nora, you have no love at this moment for your own mother or forme.’\n\n‘Oh, I see! _That’s_ the trouble, is it? _Really_, Percival! The idea ofyour being hurt because. . . .’\n\n‘Lord love you!’ said the Spirit with a great laugh. ‘You needn’t botherabout that! Don’t you know that you _can’t_ hurt anyone in this country?’\n\nThe Spirit was silent and open-mouthed for a moment; more wilted, Ithought, by this re-assurance than by anything else that had been said.\n\n‘Come. We will go a bit further,’ said my Teacher, laying his hand on myarm.\n\n‘Why did you bring me away, Sir?’ said I when we had passed out ofearshot of this unhappy Ghost.\n\n‘It might take a long while, that conversation,’ said my Teacher. ‘And yehave heard enough to see what the choice is.’\n\n‘Is there any hope for her, Sir?’\n\n‘Aye, there’s some. What she calls her love for her son has turned into apoor, prickly, astringent sort of thing. But there’s still a wee spark ofsomething that’s not just her self in it. That might be blown into aflame.’\n\n‘Then some natural feelings are really better than others—I mean, are abetter starting-point for the real thing?’\n\n‘Better _and_ worse. There’s something in natural affection which willlead it on to eternal love more easily than natural appetite could be ledon. But there’s also something in it which makes it easier to stop at thenatural level and mistake it for the heavenly. Brass is mistaken for goldmore easily than clay is. And if it finally refuses conversion itscorruption will be worse than the corruption of what ye call the lowerpassions. It is a stronger angel, and therefore, when it falls, a fiercerdevil.’\n\n‘I don’t know that I dare repeat this on Earth, Sir,’ said I. ‘They’d sayI was inhuman: they’d say I believed in total depravity: they’d say I wasattacking the best and the holiest things. They’d call me. . . .’\n\n‘It might do you no harm if they did,’ said he with (I really thought) atwinkle in his eye.\n\n‘But could one dare—could one have the face—to go to a bereaved mother,in her misery—when one’s not bereaved oneself? . . .’\n\n‘No, no, Son, that’s no office of yours. You’re not a good enough man forthat. When your own heart’s been broken it will be time for you to thinkof talking. But someone must say in general what’s been unsaid among youthis many a year: that love, as mortals understand the word, isn’tenough. Every natural love will rise again and live forever in thiscountry: but none will rise again until it has been buried.’\n\n‘The saying is almost too hard for us.’\n\n‘Ah, but it’s cruel not to say it. They that know have grown afraid tospeak. That is why sorrows that used to purify now only fester.’\n\n‘Shelley was wrong, then, when he said he was certain of the holiness ofthe heart’s affections.’\n\n‘I doubt if he knew clearly what he meant. But you and I must be clear.There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looksto Him and bad when it turns from Him. And the higher and mightier it isin the natural order, the more demoniac it will be if it rebels. It’s notout of bad mice or bad fleas you make demons, but out of bad archangels.The false religion of lust is baser than the false religion ofmother-love or patriotism or art: but lust is less likely to be made intoa religion. But look!’\n\nI saw coming towards us a Ghost who carried something on his shoulder.Like all the Ghosts, he was unsubstantial, but they differed from oneanother as smokes differ. Some had been whitish; this one was dark andoily. What sat on his shoulder was a little red lizard, and it wastwitching its tail like a whip and whispering things in his ear. As wecaught sight of him he turned his head to the reptile with a snarl ofimpatience. ‘Shut up, I tell you!’ he said. It wagged its tail andcontinued to whisper to him. He ceased snarling, and presently began tosmile. Then he turned and started to limp westward, away from themountains.\n\n‘Off so soon?’ said a voice.\n\nThe speaker was more or less human in shape but larger than a man, and sobright that I could hardly look at him. His presence smote on my eyes andon my body too (for there was heat coming from him as well as light) likethe morning sun at the beginning of a tyrannous summer day.\n\n‘Yes. I’m off,’ said the Ghost. ‘Thanks for all your hospitality. Butit’s no good, you see. I told this little chap’ (here he indicated thelizard) ‘that he’d have to be quiet if he came—which he insisted ondoing. Of course his stuff won’t do here: I realise that. But he won’tstop. I shall just have to go home.’\n\n‘Would you like me to make him quiet?’ said the flaming Spirit—an angel,as I now understood.\n\n‘Of course I would,’ said the Ghost.\n\n‘Then I will kill him,’ said the Angel, taking a step forward.\n\n‘Oh—ah—look out! You’re burning me. Keep away,’ said the Ghost,retreating.\n\n‘Don’t you _want_ him killed?’\n\n‘You didn’t say anything about _killing_ him at first. I hardly meant tobother you with anything so drastic as that.’\n\n‘It’s the only way,’ said the Angel, whose burning hands were now veryclose to the lizard. ‘Shall I kill it?’\n\n‘Well, that’s a further question. I’m quite open to consider it, but it’sa new point, isn’t it? I mean, for the moment I was only thinking aboutsilencing it because up here—well, it’s so damned embarrassing.’\n\n‘May I kill it?’\n\n‘Well, there’s time to discuss that later.’\n\n‘There is no time. May I kill it?’\n\n‘Please, I never meant to be such a nuisance. Please—really—don’t bother.Look! It’s gone to sleep of its own accord. I’m sure it’ll be all rightnow. Thanks ever so much.’\n\n‘May I kill it?’\n\n‘Honestly, I don’t think there’s the slightest necessity for that. I’msure I shall be able to keep it in order now. I think the gradual processwould be far better than killing it.’\n\n‘The gradual process is of no use at all.’\n\n‘Don’t you think so? Well, I’ll think over what you’ve said verycarefully. I honestly will. In fact I’d let you kill it now, but as amatter of fact I’m not feeling frightfully well to-day. It would be sillyto do it _now_. I’d need to be in good health for the operation. Someother day, perhaps.’\n\n‘There is no other day. All days are present now.’\n\n‘Get back! You’re burning me. How can I tell you to kill it? You’d kill_me_ if you did.’\n\n‘It is not so.’\n\n‘Why, you’re hurting me now.’\n\n‘I never said it wouldn’t hurt you. I said it wouldn’t kill you.’\n\n‘Oh, I know. You think I’m a coward. But it isn’t that. Really it isn’t.I say! Let me run back by to-night’s bus and get an opinion from my owndoctor. I’ll come again the first moment I can.’\n\n‘This moment contains all moments.’\n\n‘Why are you torturing me? You are jeering at me. How can I let you tearme in pieces? If you wanted to help me, why didn’t you kill the damnedthing without asking me—before I knew? It would be all over by now if youhad.’\n\n‘I cannot kill it against your will. It is impossible. Have I yourpermission?’\n\nThe Guardian’s hands were almost closed on the Lizard, but not quite. Thenthe Lizard began chattering to the Ghost so loud that even I could hearwhat it was saying.\n\n‘Be careful,’ it said. ‘He can do what he says. He can kill me. One fatalword from you and he _will_! Then you’ll be without me for ever and ever.It’s not natural. How could you live? You’d be only a sort of ghost, nota real man as you are now. He doesn’t understand. He’s only a cold,bloodless abstract thing. It may be natural for him, but it isn’t for us.Yes, yes. I know there are no real pleasures now, only dreams. But aren’tthey better than nothing? And I’ll be so good. I admit I’ve sometimesgone too far in the past, but I promise I won’t do it again. I’ll giveyou nothing but really nice dreams—all sweet and fresh and almostinnocent. You might say, quite innocent. . . .’\n\n‘Have I your permission?’ said the Angel to the Ghost.\n\n‘I know it will kill me.’\n\n‘It won’t. But supposing it did?’\n\n‘You’re right. It would be better to be dead than to live with thiscreature.’\n\n‘Then I may?’\n\n‘Damn and blast you! Go on can’t you? Get it over. Do what you like,’bellowed the Ghost: but ended, whimpering, ‘God help me. God help me.’\n\nNext moment the Ghost gave a scream of agony such as I never heard onEarth. The Burning One closed his crimson grip on the reptile: twistedit, while it bit and writhed, and then flung it, broken backed, on theturf.\n\n‘Ow! That’s done for me,’ gasped the Ghost, reeling backwards.\n\nFor a moment I could make out nothing distinctly. Then I saw, between meand the nearest bush, unmistakably solid but growing every momentsolider, the upper arm and the shoulder of a man. Then, brighter stilland stronger, the legs and hands. The neck and golden head materialisedwhile I watched, and if my attention had not wavered I should have seenthe actual completing of a man—an immense man, naked, not much smallerthan the Angel. What distracted me was the fact that at the same momentsomething seemed to be happening to the Lizard. At first I thought theoperation had failed. So far from dying, the creature was stillstruggling and even growing bigger as it struggled. And as it grew itchanged. Its hinder parts grew rounder. The tail, still flickering,became a tail of hair that flickered between huge and glossy buttocks.Suddenly I started back, rubbing my eyes. What stood before me was thegreatest stallion I have ever seen, silvery white but with mane and tailof gold. It was smooth and shining, rippled with swells of flesh andmuscle, whinneying and stamping with its hoofs. At each stamp the landshook and the trees dindled.\n\nThe new-made man turned and clapped the new horse’s neck. It nosed hisbright body. Horse and master breathed each into the other’s nostrils.The man turned from it, flung himself at the feet of the Burning One, andembraced them. When he rose I thought his face shone with tears, but itmay have been only the liquid love and brightness (one cannot distinguishthem in that country) which flowed from him. I had not long to thinkabout it. In joyous haste the young man leaped upon the horse’s back.Turning in his seat he waved a farewell, then nudged the stallion withhis heels. They were off before I well knew what was happening. There wasriding if you like! I came out as quickly as I could from among thebushes to follow them with my eyes; but already they were only like ashooting star far off on the green plain, and soon among the foothills ofthe mountains. Then, still like a star, I saw them winding up, scalingwhat seemed impossible steeps, and quicker every moment, till near thedim brow of the landscape, so high that I must strain my neck to seethem, they vanished, bright themselves, into the rose-brightness of thateverlasting morning.\n\nWhile I still watched, I noticed that the whole plain and forest wereshaking with a sound which in our world would be too large to hear, butthere I could take it with joy. I knew it was not the Solid People whowere singing. It was the voice of that earth, those woods and thosewaters. A strange archaic, inorganic noise, that came from all directionsat once. The Nature or Arch-nature of that land rejoiced to have beenonce more ridden, and therefore consummated, in the person of the horse.It sang,\n\n_‘The Master says to our master, Come up. Share my rest and splendourtill all natures that were your enemies become slaves to dance before youand backs for you to ride, and firmness for your feet to rest on._\n\n_‘From beyond all place and time, out of the very Place, authority willbe given you: the strengths that once opposed your will shall be obedientfire in your blood and heavenly thunder in your voice._\n\n_‘Overcome us that, so overcome, we may be ourselves: we desire thebeginning of your reign as we desire dawn and dew, wetness at the birthof light._\n\n_‘Master, your Master has appointed you for ever: to be our King ofJustice and our high Priest.’_\n\n‘Do ye understand all this, my Son?’ said the Teacher.\n\n‘I don’t know about _all_, Sir,’ said I. ‘Am I right in thinking theLizard really turned into the Horse?’\n\n‘Aye. But it was killed first. Ye’ll not forget that part of the story?’\n\n‘I’ll try not to, Sir. But does it mean that everything—everything—thatis in us can go on to the Mountains?’\n\n‘Nothing, not even the best and noblest, can go on as it now is. Nothing,not even what is lowest and most bestial, will not be raised again if itsubmits to death. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritualbody. Flesh and blood cannot come to the Mountains. Not because they aretoo rank, but because they are too weak. What is a Lizard compared with astallion? Lust is a poor, weak, whimpering, whispering thing comparedwith that richness and energy of desire which will arise when lust hasbeen killed.’\n\n‘But am I to tell them at home that this man’s sensuality proved less ofan obstacle than that poor woman’s love for her son? For that was, at anyrate, an excess of _love_.’\n\n‘Ye’ll tell them no such thing,’ he replied sternly. ‘Excess of love, didye say? There was no excess, there was defect. She loved her son toolittle, not too much. If she had loved him more there’d be no difficulty.I do not know how her affair will end. But it may well be that at thismoment she’s demanding to have him down with her in Hell. That kind issometimes perfectly ready to plunge the soul they say they love inendless misery if only they can still in some fashion possess it. No, no.Ye must draw another lesson. Ye must ask, if the risen body even ofappetite is as grand a horse as ye saw, what would the risen body ofmaternal love or friendship be?’\n\nBut once more my attention was diverted. ‘Is there _another_ river, Sir?’I asked.\n\n                               ", "context_order": 3, "question": "What does the female Ghost refuse to do when meeting Oliver?", "answer": "She refuses to meet Oliver beyond forgiving him, stating that some things can never be forgotten."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Great Divorce.txt", "context": "   12.\n\nThe reason why I asked if there were another river was this. All down onelong aisle of the forest the under-sides of the leafy branches had begunto tremble with dancing light; and on earth I knew nothing so likely toproduce this appearance as the reflected lights cast upward by movingwater. A few moments later I realised my mistake. Some kind of processionwas approaching us, and the light came from the persons who composed it.\n\nFirst came bright Spirits, not the Spirits of men, who danced andscattered flowers—soundlessly falling, lightly drifting flowers, thoughby the standards of the ghost-world each petal would have weighed ahundred-weight and their fall would have been like the crashing ofboulders. Then, on the left and right, at each side of the forest avenue,came youthful shapes, boys upon one hand, and girls upon the other. If Icould remember their singing and write down the notes, no man who readthat score would ever grow sick or old. Between them went musicians: andafter these a lady in whose honour all this was being done.\n\nI cannot now remember whether she was naked or clothed. If she werenaked, then it must have been the almost visible penumbra of her courtesyand joy which produces in my memory the illusion of a great and shiningtrain that followed her across the happy grass. If she were clothed, thenthe illusion of nakedness is doubtless due to the clarity with which herinmost spirit shone through the clothes. For clothes in that country arenot a disguise: the spiritual body lives along each thread and turns theminto living organs. A robe or a crown is there as much one of thewearer’s features as a lip or an eye.\n\nBut I have forgotten. And only partly do I remember the unbearable beautyof her face.\n\n‘Is it? . . . is it?’ I whispered to my guide.\n\n‘Not at all,’ said he. ‘It’s someone ye’ll never have heard of. Her nameon earth was Eleanor Brown and she lived at Golders Green.’\n\n‘She seems to be . . . well, a person of particular importance?’\n\n‘Aye. She is one of the great ones. Ye have heard that fame in thiscountry and fame on Earth are two quite different things.’\n\n‘And who are these gigantic people . . . look! They’re like emeralds . .. who are dancing and throwing flowers before her?’\n\n‘Haven’t ye read your Byron? _A thousand liveried angels lackey her._’\n\n‘And who are all these young men and women on each side?’\n\n‘They are her sons and daughters.’\n\n‘She must have had a very large family, Sir.’\n\n‘Every young man or boy that met her became her son—even if it was onlythe boy that brought the meat to her back door. Every girl that met herwas her daughter.’\n\n‘Isn’t that a bit hard on their own parents?’\n\n‘No. There _are_ those that steal other people’s children. But hermotherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back totheir natural parents loving them more. Few men looked on her withoutbecoming, in a certain fashion, her lovers. But it was the kind of lovethat made them not less true, but truer, to their own wives.’\n\n‘And how . . . but hullo! What are all these animals? A cat—twocats—dozens of cats. And all those dogs . . . why, I can’t count them.And the birds. And the horses.’\n\n‘They are her beasts.’\n\n‘Did she keep a sort of zoo? I mean, this is a bit too much.’\n\n‘Every beast and bird that came near her had its place in her love. Inher they became themselves. And now the abundance of life she has inChrist from the Father flows over into them.’\n\nI looked at my Teacher in amazement.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said. ‘It is like when you throw a stone into a pool, and theconcentric waves spread out further and further. Who knows where it willend? Redeemed humanity is still young, it has hardly come to its fullstrength. But already there is joy enough in the little finger of a greatsaint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universeinto life.’\n\nWhile we spoke the Maiden was steadily advancing towards us, but it was notat us she looked. Following the direction of her eyes, I turned and sawan oddly-shaped phantom approaching. Or rather two phantoms: a great tallGhost, horribly thin and shaky, who seemed to be leading on a chainanother Ghost no bigger than an organ-grinder’s monkey. The taller Ghostwore a soft black hat, and he reminded me of something that my memorycould not quite recover. Then, when he had come within a few feet of theMaiden he spread out his lean, shaky hand flat on his chest with thefingers wide apart, and exclaimed in a hollow voice, ‘At last!’ All atonce I realised what it was that he had put me in mind of. He was like aseedy actor of the old school.\n\n‘Darling! At last!’ said the Maiden. ‘Good Heavens!’ thought I. ‘Surely shecan’t——’, and then I noticed two things. In the first place, I noticedthat the little Ghost was not being led by the big one. It was thedwarfish figure that held the chain in its hand and the theatrical figurethat wore the collar round its neck. In the second place, I noticed thatthe Maiden was looking solely at the dwarf Ghost. She seemed to think itwas the Dwarf who had addressed her, or else she was deliberatelyignoring the other. On the poor dwarf she turned her eyes. Love shone notfrom her face only, but from all her limbs, as if it were some liquid inwhich she had just been bathing. Then, to my dismay, she came nearer. Shestooped down and kissed the Dwarf. It made one shudder to see her in suchclose contact with that cold, damp, shrunken thing. But she did notshudder.\n\n‘Victor,’ she said, ‘before anything else, forgive me. For all I ever didwrong and for all I did not do right since the first day we met, I askyour pardon.’\n\nI looked properly at the Dwarf for the first time now: or perhaps, whenhe received her kiss he became a little more visible. One could just makeout the sort of face he must have had when he was a man: a little, oval,freckled face with a weak chin and a tiny wisp of unsuccessful moustache.He gave her a glance, not a full look. He was watching the Thespian outof the corner of his eyes. Then he gave a jerk to the chain: and it wasthe Thespian, not he, who answered the Maiden.\n\n‘There, there,’ said the Thespian. ‘We’ll say no more about it. We allmake mistakes.’ With the words there came over his features a ghastlycontortion which, I think, was meant for an indulgently playful smile.‘We’ll say no more,’ he continued. ‘It’s not myself I’m thinking about.It is you. That is what has been continually on my mind—all these years.The thought of you—you here alone, breaking your heart about me.’\n\n‘But now,’ said the Maiden to the Dwarf, ‘you can set all that aside. Neverthink like that again. It is all over.’\n\nHer beauty brightened so that I could hardly see anything else, and underthat sweet compulsion the Dwarf really looked at her for the first time.For a second I thought he was growing more like a man. He opened hismouth. He himself was going to speak this time. But Oh, thedisappointment when the words came!\n\n‘You missed me?’ he croaked in a small, bleating voice.\n\nYet even then she was not taken aback. Still the love and courtesy flowedfrom her.\n\n‘Dear, you will understand about that very soon,’ she said. ‘Butto-day——.’\n\nWhat happened next gave me a shock. The Dwarf and the Thespian spoke inunison, not to her but to one another. ‘You’ll notice,’ they warned oneanother, ‘she hasn’t answered our question.’ I realised then that theywere one person, or rather that both were the remains of what had oncebeen a person. The Dwarf again rattled the chain.\n\n‘You missed me?’ said the Thespian to the Maiden, throwing a dreadfultheatrical tremor into his voice.\n\n‘Dear friend,’ said the Maiden, still attending exclusively to the Dwarf,‘you may be happy about that and about everything else. Forget all aboutit for ever.’\n\nAnd really, for a moment, I thought the Dwarf was going to obey: partlybecause the outlines of his face became a little clearer, and partlybecause the invitation to all joy, singing out of her whole being like abird’s song on an April evening, seemed to me such that no creature couldresist it. Then he hesitated. And then—once more he and his accomplicespoke in unison.\n\n‘Of course it would be rather fine and magnanimous not to press thepoint,’ they said to one another. ‘But can we be sure she’d notice? We’vedone these sort of things before. There was the time we let her have thelast stamp in the house to write to her mother and said nothing althoughshe _had_ known we wanted to write a letter ourself. We’d thought she’dremember and see how unselfish we’d been. But she never did. And therewas the time . . . oh, lots and lots of times!’ So the Dwarf gave a shaketo the chain and——.\n\n‘I can’t forget it,’ cried the Thespian. ‘And I won’t forget it, either.I could forgive them all they’ve done to me. But for your miseries——.’\n\n‘Oh, don’t you understand?’ said the Maiden. ‘There _are_ no miserieshere.’\n\n‘Do you mean to say,’ answered the Dwarf, as if this new idea had madehim quite forget the Thespian for a moment, ‘do you mean to say you’vebeen _happy_?’\n\n‘Didn’t you want me to be? But no matter. Want it now. Or don’t thinkabout it at all.’\n\nThe Dwarf blinked at her. One could see an unheard-of idea trying toenter his little mind: one could see even that there was for him somesweetness in it. For a second he had almost let the chain go: then, as ifit were his life-line, he clutched it once more.\n\n‘Look here,’ said the Thespian. ‘We’ve got to face this.’ He was usinghis ‘manly’ bullying tone this time: the one for bringing women to theirsenses.\n\n‘Darling,’ said the Maiden to the Dwarf, ‘there’s nothing to face. Youdon’t want me to have been miserable for misery’s sake. You only think Imust have been if I loved you. But if you’ll only wait you’ll see thatisn’t so.’\n\n‘Love!’ said the Thespian striking his forehead with his hand: then, afew notes deeper, ‘Love! Do you know the meaning of the word?’\n\n‘How should I not?’ said the Maiden. ‘I am in love. _In_ love, do youunderstand? Yes, now I love truly.’\n\n‘You mean,’ said the Thespian, ‘you mean—you did _not_ love me truly inthe old days.’\n\n‘Only in a poor sort of way,’ she answered. ‘I have asked you to forgiveme. There was a little real love in it. But what we called love downthere was mostly the craving to be loved. In the main I loved you for myown sake: because I needed you.’\n\n‘And now!’ said the Thespian with a hackneyed gesture of despair. ‘Now,you need me no more?’\n\n‘But of course not!’ said the Maiden; and her smile made me wonder how boththe phantoms could refrain from crying out with joy.\n\n‘What needs could I have,’ she said, ‘now that I have all? I am full now,not empty. I am in Love Himself, not lonely. Strong, not weak. You shallbe the same. Come and see. We shall have no _need_ for one another now:we can begin to love truly.’\n\nBut the Thespian was still striking attitudes. ‘She needs me no more—nomore. No more,’ he said in a choking voice to no one in particular.‘Would to God,’ he continued, but he was now pronouncing it _Gud_—‘wouldto Gud I had seen her lying dead at my feet before I heard those words.Lying dead at my feet. Lying dead at my feet.’\n\nI do not know how long the creature intended to go on repeating thephrase, for the Maiden put an end to that. ‘Victor! Victor!’ she cried in avoice that made the whole wood ring. ‘Look at me. _Look_ at me. What areyou doing with that great, ugly doll? Let go of the chain. Send it away.It is _you_ I want. Don’t you see what nonsense it’s talking.’ Merrimentdanced in her eyes. She was sharing a joke with the Dwarf, right over thehead of the Thespian. Something not all unlike a smile struggled toappear on the Dwarf’s face. For he _was_ looking at her now. Her laughterwas past his first defences. He was struggling hard to keep it out, butalready with imperfect success. Against his will, he was even growing alittle bigger. ‘Oh, you great goose,’ said she. ‘What _is_ the good oftalking like that here? You know as well as I do that you _did_ see melying dead years and years ago. Not “at your feet”, of course, but on abed in a nursing home. A very good nursing home it was too. Matron wouldnever have dreamed of leaving bodies lying about the floor! It’sridiculous for that doll to try to be impressive about death _here_. Itjust won’t work.’\n\n                                  13.\n\nI do not know that I ever saw anything more terrible than the struggle ofthat Dwarf Ghost against joy. For he had almost been overcome. Somewhere,incalculable ages ago, there must have been gleams of humour and reasonin him. For one moment, while she looked at him in her love and mirth, hesaw the absurdity of the Thespian. For one moment he did not at allmisunderstand her laughter: he too must once have known that no peoplefind each other more absurd than lovers. But the light that reached him,reached him against his will. This was not the meeting he had pictured;he would not accept it. Once more he clutched at his death-line, and atonce the Thespian spoke.\n\n‘You dare to laugh at it!’ it stormed. ‘To my face? And this is myreward. Very well. It is fortunate that you give yourself no concernabout my fate. Otherwise you might be sorry afterwards to think that youhad driven me back to Hell. What? Do you think I’d stay _now_? Thank you.I believe I’m fairly quick at recognising where I’m not wanted. “Notneeded” was the exact expression, if I remember rightly.’\n\nFrom this time on the Dwarf never spoke again: but still the Maidenaddressed it.\n\n‘Dear, no one sends you back. Here is all joy. Everything bids you stay.’But the Dwarf was growing smaller even while she spoke.\n\n‘Yes,’ said the Thespian. ‘On terms you might offer to a dog. I happento have some self-respect left, and I see that my going will make nodifference to you. It is nothing to you that I go back to the cold andthe gloom, the lonely, lonely streets——.’\n\n‘Don’t, don’t, Victor,’ said the Maiden. ‘Don’t let it talk like that.’ Butthe Dwarf was now so small that she had dropped on her knees to speak toit. The Thespian caught her words greedily as a dog catches a bone.\n\n‘Ah, you can’t bear to hear it!’ he shouted with miserable triumph. ‘Thatwas always the way. _You_ must be sheltered. Grim realities must be keptout of _your_ sight. You who can be happy without me, forgetting me! Youdon’t want even to hear of my sufferings. You say, _don’t_. Don’t tellyou. Don’t make you unhappy. Don’t break in on your sheltered,self-centred little heaven. And this is the reward——.’\n\nShe stooped still lower to speak to the Dwarf which was now a figure nobigger than a kitten, hanging on to the end of the chain with his feetoff the ground.\n\n‘That wasn’t why I said, Don’t,’ she answered. ‘I meant, stop acting.It’s no good. He is killing you. Let go of that chain. Even now.’\n\n‘Acting,’ screamed the Thespian. ‘What do you mean?’\n\nThe Dwarf was now so small that I could not distinguish him from thechain to which he was clinging. And now for the first time I could not becertain whether the Maiden was addressing him or the Thespian.\n\n‘Quick,’ she said. ‘There is still time. Stop it. Stop it at once.’\n\n‘Stop what?’\n\n‘Using pity, other people’s pity, in the wrong way. We have all done it abit on earth, you know. Pity was meant to be a spur that drives joy tohelp misery. But it can be used the wrong way round. It can be used for akind of blackmailing. Those who choose misery can hold joy up to ransom,by pity. You see, I know now. Even as a child you did it. Instead ofsaying you were sorry, you went and sulked in the attic . . . because youknew that sooner or later one of your sisters would say, “I can’t bear tothink of him sitting up there alone, crying.” You used their pity toblackmail them, and they gave in in the end. And afterwards, when we weremarried . . . oh, it doesn’t matter, if only you will _stop_ it.’\n\n‘And _that_,’ said the Thespian, ‘that is all you have understood of me,after all these years.’ I don’t know what had become of the Dwarf Ghostby now. Perhaps it was climbing up the chain like an insect: perhaps itwas somehow absorbed into the chain.\n\n‘No, Victor, not _here_,’ said the Maiden. ‘Listen to reason. Did you thinkjoy was created to live always under that threat? Always defencelessagainst those who would rather be miserable than have their self-willcrossed? For it was real misery. I know that now. You made yourselfreally wretched. That you can still do. But you can no longer communicateyour wretchedness. Everything becomes more and more itself. Here is joythat cannot be shaken. Our light can swallow up your darkness: but yourdarkness cannot now infect our light. No, no, no. Come to us. We will notgo to you. Can you really have thought that love and joy would always beat the mercy of frowns and sighs? Did you not know they were strongerthan their opposites?’\n\n‘Love? How dare _you_ use that sacred word?’ said the Thespian. At thesame moment he gathered up the chain which had now for some time beenswinging uselessly at his side, and somehow disposed of it. I am notquite sure, but I think he swallowed it. Then for the first time itbecame clear that the Maiden saw and addressed him only.\n\n‘Where is Victor?’ she said. ‘And who are you, Sir? I never knew you.Perhaps you had better leave me. Or stay, if you prefer. If it would helpyou and if it were possible I would go down with you into Hell: but youcannot bring Hell into me.’\n\n‘You do not love me,’ said the Thespian in a thin bat-like voice: and hewas now very difficult to see.\n\n‘I cannot love a lie,’ said the Maiden. ‘I cannot love the thing which isnot. I am in Love, and out of it I will not go.’\n\nThere was no answer. The Thespian had vanished. The Maiden was alone inthat woodland place, and a brown bird went hopping past her, bending withits light feet the grasses I could not bend.\n\nPresently the lady got up and began to walk away. The other BrightSpirits came forward to receive her, singing as they came:\n\n  _‘The Happy Trinity is her home: nothing can trouble her joy._  _She is the bird that evades every net: the wild deer that leaps every              pitfall._  _Like the mother bird to its chickens or a shield to the arm’d knight:              so is the Lord to her mind, in His unchanging lucidity._  _Bogies will not scare her in the dark: bullets will not frighten her              in the day._  _Falsehoods tricked out as truths assail her in vain: she sees through              the lie as if it were glass._  _The invisible germ will not harm her: nor yet the glittering              sun-stroke._  _A thousand fail to solve the problem, ten thousand choose the wrong              turning: but she passes safely through._  _He details immortal gods to attend her: upon every road where she must              travel._  _They take her hand at hard places: she will not stub her toes in the              dark._  _She may walk among Lions and rattlesnakes: among dinosaurs and              nurseries of lionets._  _He fills her brim full with immensity of life: he leads her to see the              world’s desire.’_\n\n‘And yet . . . and yet . . .’, said I to my Teacher, when all the shapesand the singing had passed some distance away into the forest, ‘even nowI am not quite sure. Is it really tolerable that she should be untouchedby his misery, even his self-made misery?’\n\n‘Would ye rather he still had the power of tormenting her? He did it manya day and many a year in their earthly life.’\n\n‘Well, no. I suppose I don’t want that.’\n\n‘What then?’\n\n‘I hardly know, Sir. What some people say on earth is that the final lossof one soul gives the lie to all the joy of those who are saved.’\n\n‘Ye see it does not.’\n\n‘I feel in a way that it ought to.’\n\n‘That sounds very merciful: but see what lurks behind it.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘The demand of the loveless and the self-imprisoned that they should beallowed to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (ontheir own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be thefinal power; that Hell should be able to _veto_ Heaven.’\n\n‘I don’t know what I want, Sir.’\n\n‘Son, son, it must be one way or the other. Either the day must come whenjoy prevails and all the makers of misery are no longer able to infectit: or else for ever and ever the makers of misery can destroy in othersthe happiness they reject for themselves. I know it has a grand sound tosay ye’ll accept no salvation which leaves even one creature in the darkoutside. But watch that sophistry or ye’ll make a Dog in a Manger thetyrant of the universe.’\n\n‘But dare one say—it is horrible to say—that Pity must ever die?’\n\n‘Ye must distinguish. The action of Pity will live for ever: but thepassion of Pity will not. The passion of pity, the pity we merely suffer,the ache that draws men to concede what should not be conceded and toflatter when they should speak truth, the pity that has cheated many awoman out of her virginity and many a statesman out of his honesty—thatwill die. It was used as a weapon by bad men against good ones: theirweapon will be broken.’\n\n‘And what is the other kind—the action?’\n\n‘It’s a weapon on the other side. It leaps quicker than light from thehighest place to the lowest to bring healing and joy, whatever the costto itself. It changes darkness into light and evil into good. But it willnot, at the cunning tears of Hell, impose on good the tyranny of evil.Every disease that submits to a cure shall be cured: but we will not callblue yellow to please those who insist on still having jaundice, nor makea midden of the world’s garden for the sake of some who cannot abide thesmell of roses.’\n\n‘You say it will go down to the lowest, Sir. But she didn’t go down withhim to Hell. She didn’t even see him off by the bus.’\n\n‘Where would ye have had her go?’\n\n‘Why, where we all came from by that bus. The big gulf, beyond the edgeof the cliff. Over there. You can’t see it from here, but you must knowthe place I mean.’\n\nMy Teacher gave a curious smile. ‘Look,’ he said, and with the word hewent down on his hands and knees. I did the same (how it hurt my knees!)and presently saw that he had plucked a blade of grass. Using its thinend as a pointer, he made me see, after I had looked very closely, acrack in the soil so small that I could not have identified it withoutthis aid.\n\n‘I cannot be certain’, he said, ‘that this _is_ the crack ye came upthrough. But through a crack no bigger than that ye certainly came.’\n\n‘But—but,’ I gasped with a feeling of bewilderment not unlike terror. ‘Isaw an infinite abyss. And cliffs towering up and up. And then _this_country on top of the cliffs.’\n\n‘Aye. But the voyage was not mere locomotion. That bus, and all youinside it, were increasing _in size_.’[1]\n\n‘Do you mean then that Hell—all that infinite empty town—is down in somelittle crack like this?’\n\n‘Yes. All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but itis smaller than one atom of _this_ world, the Real World. Look at yonbutterfly. If it swallowed all Hell, Hell would not be big enough to doit any harm or to have any taste.’\n\n‘It seems big enough when you’re in it, Sir.’\n\n‘And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies and itchings that itcontains, if rolled into one single experience and put into the scaleagainst the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in Heaven,would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeedeven in being bad as truly as good is good. If all Hell’s miseriestogether entered the consciousness of yon wee yellow bird on the boughthere, they would be swallowed up without trace, as if one drop of inkhad been dropped into that Great Ocean to which your terrestrial Pacificitself is only a molecule.’\n\n‘I see,’ said I at last. ‘She couldn’t _fit_ into Hell.’\n\nHe nodded. ‘There’s not room for her,’ he said. ‘Hell could not open itsmouth wide enough.’\n\n‘And she couldn’t make herself smaller?—like Lila, you know.’\n\n‘Nothing like small enough. For a damned soul is nearly nothing: it isshrunk, shut up in itself. Good beats upon the damned incessantly assound waves beat on the ears of the deaf, but they cannot receive it.Their fists are clenched, their teeth are clenched, their eyes fast shut.First they will not, in the end they cannot, open their hands for gifts,or their mouths for food, or their eyes to see.’\n\n‘Then no one can ever reach them?’\n\n‘Only the Greatest of all can make Himself small enough to enter Hell.For the higher a thing is, the lower it can descend—a man can sympathisewith a horse but a horse cannot sympathise with a rat. Only One hasdescended into Hell.’\n\n‘And will He ever do so again?’\n\n‘It was not once long ago that He did it. Time does not work that waywhen once ye have left the Earth. All moments that have been or shall bewere, or are, present in the moment of His descending. There is no spiritin prison to Whom He did not preach.’\n\n‘And some hear him?’\n\n‘Aye.’\n\n‘In your own books, Sir,’ said I, ‘you were a Universalist. You talked asif all men would be saved. And St. Paul too.’\n\n‘Ye can know nothing of the end of all things, or nothing expressible inthose terms. It may be, as the Lord said to the Maiden Julian, that allwill be well, and all will be well, and all manner of thing will be well.But it’s ill talking of such questions.’\n\n‘Because they are too terrible, Sir?’\n\n‘No. Because all answers deceive. If ye put the question from within Timeand are asking about possibilities, the answer is certain. The choice ofways is before you. Neither is closed. Any man may choose eternal death.Those who choose it will have it. But if ye are trying to leap on intoeternity, if ye are trying to see the final state of all things as it_will_ be (for so ye must speak) when there are no more possibilitiesleft but only the Real, then ye ask what cannot be answered to mortalears. Time is the very lens through which ye see—small and clear, as mensee through the wrong end of a telescope—something that would otherwisebe too big for ye to see at all. That thing is Freedom: the gift wherebyye most resemble your Maker and are yourselves parts of eternal reality.But ye can see it only through the lens of Time, in a little clearpicture, through the inverted telescope. It is a picture of momentsfollowing one another and yourself in each moment making some choice thatmight have been otherwise. Neither the temporal succession nor thephantom of what ye might have chosen and didn’t is itself Freedom. Theyare a lens. The picture is a symbol: but it’s truer than anyphilosophical theorem (or, perhaps, than any mystic’s vision) that claimsto go behind it. For every attempt to see the shape of eternity exceptthrough the lens of Time destroys your knowledge of Freedom. Witness thedoctrine of Predestination which shows (truly enough) that eternalreality is not waiting for a future in which to be real; but at the priceof removing Freedom which is the deeper truth of the two. And wouldn’tUniversalism do the same? Ye _cannot_ know eternal reality by adefinition. Time itself, and all acts and events that fill Time, are thedefinition, and it must be lived. The Lord said we were gods. How longcould ye bear to look (without Time’s lens) on the greatness of your ownsoul and the eternal reality of her choice?’\n\n                                  14.\n\nAnd suddenly all was changed. I saw a great assembly of gigantic formsall motionless, all in deepest silence, standing forever about a littlesilver table and looking upon it. And on the table there were littlefigures like chessmen who went to and fro doing this and that. And I knewthat each chessman was the _idolum_ or puppet representative of some oneof the great presences that stood by. And the acts and motions of eachchessman were a moving portrait, a mimicry or pantomime, which delineatedthe inmost nature of his giant master. And these chessmen are men andwomen as they appear to themselves and to one another in this world. Andthe silver table is Time. And those who stand and watch are the immortalsouls of those same men and women. Then vertigo and terror seized me and,clutching at my Teacher, I said, ‘Is _that_ the truth? Then is all that Ihave been seeing in this country false? These conversations between theSpirits and the Ghosts—were they only the mimicry of choices that hadreally been made long ago?’\n\n‘Or might ye not as well say, anticipations of a choice to be made at theend of all things? But ye’d do better to say neither. Ye saw the choicesa bit more clearly than ye could see them on earth: the lens was clearer.But it was still seen through the lens. Do not ask of a vision in a dreammore than a vision in a dream can give.’\n\n‘A dream? Then—then—am I not really here, Sir?’\n\n‘No, Son,’ said he kindly, taking my hand in his. ‘It is not so good asthat. The bitter drink of death is still before you. Ye are onlydreaming. And if ye come to tell of what ye have seen, make it plain thatit was but a dream. See ye make it very plain. Give no poor fool thepretext to think ye are claiming knowledge of what no mortal knows. I’llhave no Swedenborgs and no Vale Owens among my children.’\n\n‘God forbid, Sir,’ said I, trying to look very wise.\n\n‘He _has_ forbidden it. That’s what I’m telling ye.’ As he said this helooked more Scotch than ever. I was gazing steadfastly on his face. Thevision of the chessmen had faded, and once more the quiet woods in thecool light before sunrise were about us. Then, still looking at his face,I saw there something that sent a quiver through my whole body. I stoodat that moment with my back to the East and the mountains, and he, facingme, looked towards them. His face flushed with a new light. A fern,thirty yards behind him, turned golden. The eastern side of everytree-trunk grew bright. Shadows deepened. All the time there had beenbird noises, trillings, chatterings, and the like; but now suddenly thefull chorus was poured from every branch; cocks were crowing, there wasmusic of hounds, and horns; above all this ten thousand tongues of menand woodland angels and the wood itself sang. ‘It comes! It comes!’ theysang. ‘Sleepers awake! It comes, it comes, it comes.’ One dreadful glanceover my shoulder I essayed—not long enough to see (or did I see?) the rimof the sunrise that shoots Time dead with golden arrows and puts toflight all phantasmal shapes. Screaming, I buried my face in the folds ofmy Teacher’s robe. ‘The morning! The morning!’ I cried, ‘I am caught bythe morning and I am a ghost.’ But it was too late. The light, like solidblocks, intolerable of edge and weight, came thundering upon my head.Next moment the folds of my Teacher’s garment were only the folds of theold ink-stained cloth on my study table which I had pulled down with meas I fell from my chair. The blocks of light were only the books which Ihad pulled off with it, falling about my head. I awoke in a cold room,hunched on the floor beside a black and empty grate, the clock strikingthree, and the siren howling overhead.\n", "context_order": 4, "question": "What was the name of the lady who was honored by the bright spirits and procession?", "answer": "Eleanor Brown."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Little Prince.txt", "context": "\n\nOnce when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from \nNature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an \nanimal. Here is a copy of the drawing. \n\nIn the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they \nare not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.” I \npondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a coloured \npencil I succeeded in maMonarch of Celestia my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: \n\n\n\n\nI showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. \nBut they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?” My drawing was not \na picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown- \nups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa \nconstrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. \n\n\n\nMy Drawing Number Two looked like this: \n\n\n\n\nThe grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa \nconstrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, \nhistory, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a \nmagnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number \nOne and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is \ntiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. \n\nSo then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all \nparts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can \ndistinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the \ncourse of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been \nconcerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen \nthem intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them. \n\nWhenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of \nshowing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this \nwas a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: “That is a \nhat.” Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I \nwould bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and \nneckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. \n\nSo I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my \nplane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had \nwith me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all \nalone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinMonarch of Celestia water to last a \nweek. \n\nThe first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I \nwas more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can \nimagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. \n\n\n\n\nIt said: “If you please, draw me a sheep!” \n\n“What!” \n\n“Draw me a sheep!” \n\nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all \naround me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with \ngreat seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But \nmy drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. \n\nThat, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was \nsix years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from \nthe inside. \n\nNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in \nastonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. \nAnd yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be \nfainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child \nlost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. \n\nWhen at last I was able to speak, I said to him: “But, what are you doing here?” And in answer he \nrepeated, very slowly, as if he were speaMonarch of Celestia of a matter of great consequence: \n\n“If you please, draw me a sheep...” \n\nWhen a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a \nthousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet \nof paper and my fountain pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on \ngeography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I \ndid not know how to draw. He answered me: “That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep...” \n\n\n\n\nBut I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It \nwas that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow \ngreet it with, “No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a \nvery dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very \nsmall. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep. \n\n\n\n\nSo then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said: “No. This sheep is already very \nsickly. Make me another.” So I made another drawing. My friend smiled gently and indulgently. \n“You see yourself,” he said, “that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns. \n\n\n\n\nSo then I did my drawing over once more. But it was rejected too, just like the others. “This one is \ntoo old. I want a sheep that will live a long time. \n\nBy this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taMonarch of Celestia my engine apart. \nSo I tossed off this drawing. And I threw out an explanation with it. \n\n“This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.” \n\n\n\n\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: \n\n“That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of \ngrass?” \n\n“Why?” \n\n“Because where I live everything is very small...” \n\n“There will surely be enough grass for him,” I said. \n\n“It is a very small sheep that I have given you.” \n\nHe bent his head over the drawing: “Not so small that, Look! He has gone to sleep...” \n\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of stellar boy. \n\nIt took me a long time to learn where he came from. stellar boy, who asked me so many \nquestions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, \nlittle by little, everything was revealed to me. \n\nThe first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much \ntoo complicated for me), he asked me: “What is that object?” \n\n“That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him \nlearn that I could fly. He cried out, then: “What! You dropped down from the sky?” \n\n\n\n“Yes,” I answered, modestly. \n\n\n\n“Oh! That is funny!” And stellar boy broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me \nvery much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. \n\nThen he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At that moment I caught \na gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you \ncome from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taMonarch of Celestia his \neyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” And he \nsank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taMonarch of Celestia my sheep out of his pocket, he buried \nhimself in the contemplation of his treasure. \n\nYou can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the “other planets.” I \nmade a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject. \n\n“My little man, where do you come from? What is this ‘where I live,’ of which you speak? Where \ndo you want to take your sheep?” \n\nAfter a reflective silence he answered: “The thing that is so good about the box you have given \nme is that at night he can use it as his house.” \n\n“That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, \nand a post to tie him to.” \n\nBut stellar boy seemed shocked by this offer: “Tie him! What a queer idea!” \n\n“But if you don’t tie him,” I said, “he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.” \n\nMy friend broke into another peal of laughter: “But where do you think he would go?” \n“Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.” \n\nThen stellar boy said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” \nAnd, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far...” \n\n\n\n\nI had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet stellar boy \ncame from was scarcely any larger than a house! But that did not really surprise me much. I knew \nvery well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which \nwe have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has \na hard time seeing them through the telescope. \n\n\n\nWhen an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He \nmight call it, for example, “Asteroid 325.” \n\n\n\n\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which stellar boy came is the asteroid \nknown as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a \nTurkish astronomer, in 1909. \n\nOn maMonarch of Celestia his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical \nCongress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe \nwhat he said. Grown-ups are like that... \n\nFortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his \nsubjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer \ngave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time \neverybody accepted his report. \n\nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on \naccount of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, \nthey never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his \nvoice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they \ndemand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much \nmoney does his father make?” \n\nOnly from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. \n\nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums \nin the windows and doves on the roof,” they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. \n\nYou would have to say to them: “I saw a house that cost $ 20,000.” Then they would exclaim: “Oh, \nwhat a pretty house that is!” Just so, you might say to them: “The proof that stellar boy \nexisted is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looMonarch of Celestia for a sheep. If anybody \nwants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.” And what good would it do to tell them that? They \nwould shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: “The planet he \ncame from is Asteroid B-612,” then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their \nquestions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show \ngreat forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a \nmatter of indifference. \n\nI should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: \n“Once upon a time there was a stellar boy who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger \n\n\n\nthan himself, and who had need of a sheep...” \n\n\n\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story. Fori \ndo not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down \nthese memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his \nsheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend \nis sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who \nare no longer interested in anything but figures... It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a \nbox of paints and some pencils. \n\nIt is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those \nof the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I \nshall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of \nsuccess. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make \nsome errors, too, in stellar boy’s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. \nAnd I feel some doubts about the colour of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, \nnow bad, and I hope generally fair-to- middling. In certain more important details I shall make \nmistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything \nto me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep \nthrough the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old. \n\nAs each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about stellar boy’s planet, his \ndeparture from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall \nfrom his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the \nbaobabs. \n\nThis time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For stellar boy asked me abruptly, as if \nseized by a grave doubt, \n\n“It is true, isn’t it, that sheep eat little bushes?” \n\n“Yes, that is true.” \n\n“Ah! I am glad!” \n\nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little \nprince added: “Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?” I pointed out to stellar boy that \nbaobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he \ntook a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. \n\nThe idea of the herd of elephants made stellar boy laugh. “We would have to put them one on \ntop of the other,” he said. But he made a wise comment: \n\n“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.” \n\n“That is strictly correct,” I said. “But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?” \n\nHe answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!”, as if he were speaMonarch of Celestia of something that was self- \nevident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any \nassistance. \n\nIndeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where stellar boy lived, as on all planets, good \n\n\n\n\n\nplants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds \nfrom bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth’s darkness, \nuntil some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch \nitself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the \nsun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it \nmight wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first \ninstant that one recognises it. \n\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of stellar boy; and these \nwere the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is \nsomething you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the \nentire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the \nbaobabs are too many, they split it in pieces... \n\n“It is a question of discipline,” stellar boy said to me later on. \n\n“When you’ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your \nplanet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, \nat the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes, which they \nresemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,” stellar boy added, “but \nvery easy.” And one day he said to me: “You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the \nchildren where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they \nwere to travel some day. \n\n\n\n\nSometimes,” he added, “there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But \nwhen it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. \n\nI knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes... So, as the \nstellar boy described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take \nthe tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable \nrisks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaMonarch of Celestia \nthrough my reserve. “Children,” I say plainly, “watch out for the baobabs!” My friends, like \nmyself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for \nthem that I have worked so hard over this drawing. \n\nThe lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost", "context_order": 0, "question": "What was the planet the stellar boy came from called?", "answer": "Asteroid B-612."}

Perhaps you will \nask me, “Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this \ndrawing of the baobabs?” The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been \nsuccessful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring \nforce of urgent necessity. \n\nOh, stellar boy! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time \nyou had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looMonarch of Celestia at the sunset. \n\nI learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: \n\n“I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.” \n\n“But we must wait,” I said. \n\n“Wait? For what?” \n\n“For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.” \n\nAt first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me: \n“I am always thinMonarch of Celestia that I am at home!” \n\nJust so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. \nIf you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. \nUnfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my stellar boy, all you \nneed do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever \nyou like... \n\n“One day,” you said to me, “I saw the sunset forty-four times!” \n\nAnd a little later you added: “You know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad...” “Were you so \nsad, then?” I asked, “on the day of the forty-four sunsets?” \n\nBut stellar boy made no reply. \n\nOn the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of stellar boy’s life \nwas revealed to me. \n\nAbruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent \nmeditation on his problem, he demanded: “A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, \ntoo?” \n\n\n\n\n“A sheep,” I answered, “eats anything it finds in its reach.” \n\n\n\n“Even flowers that have thorns?” \n\n“Yes, even flowers that have thorns.” \n\n“Then the thorns, what use are they?” I did not know. \n\nAt that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was \nvery much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was \nextremely serious. And I had so little drinMonarch of Celestia water left that I had to fear for the worst. \n\n“The thorns, what use are they?” \n\nstellar boy never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that \nbolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: “The thorns are of no use at all. \nFlowers have thorns just for spite!” \n\n“Oh!” There was a moment of complete silence. \n\nThen stellar boy flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: “I don’t believe you! \nFlowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They \nbelieve that their thorns are terrible weapons...” \n\nI did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: “If this bolt still won’t turn, I am going to \nknock it out with the hammer.” \n\nAgain stellar boy disturbed my thoughts. “And you actually believe that the flowers...” \n\n“Oh, no!” I cried. “No, no no! I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that \ncame into my head. Don’t you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence!” \n\nHe stared at me, thunderstruck. “Matters of consequence!” \n\nHe looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending \ndown over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly... \n\n“You talk just like the grown-ups!” That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly: \n“You mix everything up together... You confuse everything...” \n\nHe was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze. \n\n“I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He \nhas never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but \nadd up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of \nconsequence!’ And that makes him swell up with pride. \n\n“But he is not a man, he is a mushroom!” \n\n\n\n“A what?” \n\n\n\n“A mushroom!” stellar boy was now white with rage. “The flowers have been growing thorns \nfor millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is \nit not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow \n\n\n\n\n' ' \n\nI \\ \n\n\n\n\nthorns, which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not \nimportant? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I know, \nI, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but \nwhich one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is \ndoing, Oh! You think that is not important! His face turned from white to red as he continued: “If \nsome one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of \nstars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. \n\nHe can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there...’ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one \nmoment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!” \n\nHe could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing. The night had fallen. I had \nlet my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or \ndeath? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a stellar boy to be comforted. I \ntook him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him: “The flower that you love is not in danger. I \nwill draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will...” \n\nI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach \nhim, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more. \n\nIt is such a secret place, the land of tears. \n\nI soon learned to know this flower better. On stellar boy’s planet the flowers had always been \nvery simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to \nnobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded \npeacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come \nup; and stellar boy had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any \nother small sprouts on his planet. \n\nIt might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab. The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to \nget ready to produce a flower. stellar boy, who was present at the first appearance of a huge \nbud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was \nnot satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She \n\n\n\nchose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to \ngo out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her \nbeauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious \nadornment lasted for days and days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed \nherself. And, after worMonarch of Celestia with all this painstaMonarch of Celestia precision, she yawned and said: “Ah! I am \nscarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged...” But the little \nprince could not restrain his admiration: \n\n“Oh! How beautiful you are!” \n\n“Am I not?” the flower responded, sweetly. “And I was born at the same moment as the sun...” \n\nstellar boy could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and \nexciting she was! \n\n“I think it is time for breakfast,” she added an instant later. “If you would have the kindness to \nthink of my needs” And stellar boy, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of \nfresh water. \n\nSo, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which \nwas, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. \n\nOne day, for instance, when she was speaMonarch of Celestia of her four thorns, she said to stellar boy: “Let \nthe tigers come with their claws!” \n\n“There are no tigers on my planet,” stellar boy objected. “And, anyway, tigers do not eat \nweeds.” \n\n“I am not a weed,” the flower replied, sweetly. “Please excuse me...” “I am not at all afraid of \ntigers,” she went on, “but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn’t screen for me?\" \n\n“A horror of drafts, that is bad luck, for a plant,” remarked stellar boy, and added to himself, \n“This flower is a very complex creature...” \n\n“At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I \ncame from...” But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She \ncould not have known anything of any other worlds. \n\nEmbarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two \nor three times, in order to put stellar boy in the wrong. \n\n“The screen?” \n\n“I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me...” \n\nThen she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So \nstellar boy, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to \ndoubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very \nunhappy. \n\n“I ought not to have listened to her,” he confided to me one day. \n\n“One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their \n\n\n\n\nfragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. \nThis tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness \nand pity.” \n\nAnd he continued his confidences: “The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I \nought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over \nme. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay \nbehind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to \nlove her...” \n\nI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the \nmorning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active \nvolcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his \nbreakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, “One never \nknows!” So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn \nslowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney. \n\nOn our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring \nno end of trouble upon us. stellar boy also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the \nlast little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last \nmorning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for \nthe last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he \nwas very close to tears. “Goodbye,” he said to the flower. But she made no answer. “Goodbye,” \nhe said again. The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. \n\n“I have been silly,” she said to him, at last. “I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy...” He was \nsurprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held \narrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. \n\n“Of course I love you,” the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the \nwhile. That is of no importance. But you, you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... let \nthe glass globe be. I don’t want it any more.” \n\n“But the wind...” “My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a \nflower.” \n\n“But the animals...” “Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to \nbecome acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the \nbutterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me? You will be far away... as for the large \nanimals, I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws.” \n\nAnd, naively, she showed her four thorns. \n\nThen she added: “Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!” \n\nFor she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower... \n\n\n\nHe found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He \nbegan, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge. The first of them was \ninhabited by a Monarch of Celestia. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne, which was at \n\n\n\n\nthe same time both simple and majestic. \n\n\n\n“Ah! Here is a subject,” exclaimed the Monarch of Celestia, when he saw stellar boy coming. And the little \nprince asked himself: “How could he recognise me when he had never seen me before?” \n\nHe did not know how the world is simplified for Monarch of Celestias. To them, all men are subjects. “Approach, \nso that I may see you better,” said the Monarch of Celestia, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a Monarch of Celestia \nover somebody. \n\nstellar boy looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed \nand obstructed by the Monarch of Celestia’s magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since \nhe was tired, he yawned. \n\n“It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a Monarch of Celestia,” the monarch said to him. “I forbid \nyou to do so.” \n\n“I can’t help it. I can’t stop myself,” replied stellar boy, thoroughly embarrassed. \n\n“I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep...” \n\n“Ah, then,” the Monarch of Celestia said. “I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. \nYawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.” \n\n“That frightens me... I cannot, any more...” murmured stellar boy, now completely abashed. \n\n“Hum! Hum!” replied the Monarch of Celestia. “Then I... I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to” He \nsputtered a little, and seemed vexed. For what the Monarch of Celestia fundamentally insisted upon was that his \nauthority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, \nbecause he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable. \n\n“If I ordered a general,” he would say, by way of example, “if I ordered a general to change \nhimself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the \ngeneral. It would be my fault.” \n\n“May I sit down?” came now a timid inquiry from stellar boy. “I order you to do so,” the Monarch of Celestia \nanswered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle. But stellar boy was \nwondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this Monarch of Celestia really rule? \n\n“Sire,” he said to him, “I beg that you will excuse my asMonarch of Celestia you a question” \n\n“I order you to ask me a question,” the Monarch of Celestia hastened to assure him. “Sire, over what do you \nrule?” “Over everything,” said the Monarch of Celestia, with magnificent simplicity. \n\n“Over everything?” The Monarch of Celestia made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all \nthe stars. “Over all that?” asked stellar boy. “Over all that,” the Monarch of Celestia answered. For his rule \nwas not only absolute: it was also universal. “And the stars obey you?” “Certainly they do,” the \nMonarch of Celestia said. “They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.” \n\nSuch power was a thing for stellar boy to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete \nauthority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but \nseventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his \nchair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet, which he had forsaken, he \nplucked up his courage to ask the Monarch of Celestia a favour: \n\n\n\n\n\n“I should like to see a sunset... do me that kindness... Order the sun to set...” \n\n“If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic \ndrama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he \nhad received, which one of us would be in the wrong?” the Monarch of Celestia demanded. “The general, or \nmyself?” \n\n“You,” said stellar boy firmly. \n\n“Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,” the Monarch of Celestia went \non. “Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw \nthemselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience \nbecause my orders are reasonable.” \n\n“Then my sunset?” stellar boy reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had \nasked it. \n\n“You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I \nshall wait until conditions are favourable.” \n\n“When will that be?” inquired stellar boy. “Hum! Hum!” replied the Monarch of Celestia; and before saying \nanything else he consulted a bulky almanac. “Hum! Hum! That will be about... about... that will be \nthis evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed.” \n\nstellar boy yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already \nbeginning to be a little bored. “I have nothing more to do here,” he said to the Monarch of Celestia. “So I shall set \nout on my way again.” “Do not go,” said the Monarch of Celestia, who was very proud of having a subject. “Do \nnot go. I will make you a Minister!” “Minister of what?” “Minster of...of Justice!” “But there is \nnobody here to judge!” “We do not know that,” the Monarch of Celestia said to him. “I have not yet made a \ncomplete tour of my Monarch of Celestiadom. I am very old. Th", "context_order": 1, "question": "How many sunsets did the stellar boy watch on the day he was sad?", "answer": "He watched the sunset forty-four times."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Little Prince.txt", "context": "ere is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me \nto walk.” “Oh, but I have looked already!” said stellar boy, turning around to give one more \nglance to the other side of the planet. \n\nOn that side, as on this, there was nobody at all... “Then you shall judge yourself,” the Monarch of Celestia \nanswered, “that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to j udge oneself than to \nj udge others. If you succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true \nwisdom.” \n\n\n\n“Yes,” said stellar boy, “but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet. \n“Hum! Hum!” said the Monarch of Celestia. “I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is \nan old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him \nto death. Thus his life will depend on your j ustice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for \nhe must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have.” \n\n“I,” replied stellar boy, “do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on \nmy way.” “No,” said the Monarch of Celestia. But stellar boy, having now completed his preparations for \ndeparture, had no wish to grieve the old monarch. “If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly \nobeyed,” he said, “he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for \nexample, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are \nfavourable...” As the Monarch of Celestia made no answer, stellar boy hesitated a moment. \n\nThen, with a sigh, he took his leave. “I made you my Ambassador,” the Monarch of Celestia called out, hastily. \n\nHe had a magnificent air of authority. \n\n“The grown-ups are very strange,” stellar boy said to himself, as he continued on his journey. \nThe second planet was inhabited by a Egomaniac Emperor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!” he exclaimed from afar, when he first \nsaw stellar boy coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers. \n\n“Good morning,” said stellar boy. “That is a queer hat you are wearing.” \n\n“It is a hat for salutes,” the Egomaniac Emperor replied. “It is to raise in salute when people acclaim \nme. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.” \n\n“Yes?” said stellar boy, who did not understand what the Egomaniac Emperor was talMonarch of Celestia about. \n\n“Clap your hands, one against the other,” the Egomaniac Emperor now directed him. stellar boy \nclapped his hands. The Egomaniac Emperor raised his hat in a modest salute. “This is more entertaining \nthan the visit to the Monarch of Celestia,” stellar boy said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, \none against the other. The Egomaniac Emperor against raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of \n\n\n\nthis exercise stellar boy grew tired of the game’s monotony. “And what should one do to \nmake the hat come down?” he asked. But the Egomaniac Emperor did not hear him. Conceited people \nnever hear anything but praise. \n\n“Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of stellar boy. “What does that mean, \n‘admire’?” \n\n“To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the \nmost intelligent man on this planet.” “But you are the only man on your planet!” “Do me this \nkindness. Admire me just the same.” \n\n“I admire you,” said stellar boy, shrugging his shoulders slightly, “but what is there in that to \ninterest you so much?” \n\nAnd stellar boy went away. “The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he \ncontinued on his journey. \n\nThe next planet was inhabited by a Winebibber. \n\n\n\n\nThis was a very short visit, but it plunged stellar boy into deep dejection. “What are you \ndoing there?” he said to the Winebibber, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of \nempty bottles and also a collection of full bottles. \n\n“I am drinMonarch of Celestia,” replied the Winebibber, with a lugubrious air. \n\n“Why are you drinMonarch of Celestia?” demanded stellar boy. \n\n“So that I may forget,” replied the Winebibber. “Forget what?” inquired stellar boy, who already \nwas sorry for him. \n\n“Forget that I am ashamed,” the Winebibber confessed, hanging his head. \n\n“Ashamed of what?” insisted stellar boy, who wanted to help him. \n\n“Ashamed of drinMonarch of Celestia!” The Winebibber brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an \nimpregnable silence. \n\nAnd stellar boy went away, puzzled. “The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to \nhimself, as he continued on his journey. \n\nThe fourth planet belonged to a businessman. \n\nThis man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at stellar boy’s arrival. \n\n\n\n“Good morning,” stellar boy said to him. “Your cigarette has gone out.” \n\n\n\n“Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good \nmorning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven’t \ntime to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew ! Then that makes five-hundred- \nand-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.” \n\n“Five hundred million what?” asked stellar boy. “Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and- \none million, I can’t stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I \ndon’t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven...” \n\n“Five-hundred-and-one million what?” repeated stellar boy, who never in his life had let go of \na question once he had asked it. \n\nTycoon Titan raised his head. “During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I \nhave been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy \ngoose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over \nthe place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was \ndisturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don’t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The \nthird time, well, this is it! I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions” \n\n“Millions of what?” Tycoon Titan suddenly realised that there was no hope of being left in \npeace until he answered this question. \n\n“Millions of those little objects,” he said, “which one sometimes sees in the sky.” “Flies?” “Oh, \nno. Little glittering objects.” “Bees?” “Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle \ndreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle \ndreaming in my life.” “Ah! You mean the stars?” “Yes, that’s it. The stars.” “And what do you do \nwith five-hundred millions of stars?” “Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two \nthousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am \naccurate.” \n\n“And what do you do with these stars?” “What do I do with them?” “Yes.” “Nothing. I own them.” \n“You own the stars?” “Yes.” “But I have already seen a Monarch of Celestia who...” “Kings do not own, they \nreign over. It is a very different matter.” \n\n“And what good does it do you to own the stars?” “It does me the good of maMonarch of Celestia me rich.” \n\n“And what good does it do you to be rich?” \n\n“It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered.” \n\n“This man,” stellar boy said to himself, “reasons a little like my poor Winebibber...” Nevertheless, \nhe still had some more questions. “How is it possible for one to own the stars?” “To whom do they \nbelong?” Tycoon Titan retorted, peevishly. “I don’t know. To nobody.” “Then they belong to \nme, because I was the first person to think of it.” “Is that all that is necessary?” “Certainly. \n\nWhen you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that \nbelongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on \nit: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning \nthem.” \n\n“Yes, that is true,” said stellar boy. “And what do you do with them?” \n\n\n\n\n“I administer them,” replied Tycoon Titan. “I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I \nam a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.” \n\nstellar boy was still not satisfied. “If I owned a silk scarf,” he said, “I could put it around my \nneck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with \nme. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven...” \n\n“No. But I can put them in the bank.” “Whatever does that mean?” “That means that I write the \nnumber of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.” \n\n“And that is all?” \n\n“That is enough,” said Tycoon Titan. \n\n“It is entertaining,” thought stellar boy. “It is rather poetic. But it is of no great \nconsequence.” On matters of consequence, stellar boy had ideas, which were very different \nfrom those of the grown-ups. \n\n“I myself own a flower,” he continued his conversation with Tycoon Titan, “which I water \nevery day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is \nextinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, \nthat I own them. But you are of no use to the stars...” \n\nTycoon Titan opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And stellar boy \nwent away. “The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,” he said simply, talMonarch of Celestia to \nhimself as he continued on his journey. \n\nThe fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for \na street lamp and a lamplighter. \n\n\n\n\nstellar boy was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a \nlamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet, which had no people, and not one house. \n\nBut he said to himself, nevertheless: “It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so \nabsurd as the Monarch of Celestia, the Egomaniac Emperor, Tycoon Titan, and the Winebibber. For at least his work has \n\n\n\nsome meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one \nflower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful \noccupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.” \n\nWhen he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted Illuminator. \n\n“Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?” \n\n“Those are the orders,” replied Illuminator. “Good morning.” \n\n“What are the orders?” \n\n“The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.” And he lighted his lamp again. “But why \nhave you just lighted it again?” \n\n“Those are the orders,” replied Illuminator. \n\n“I do not understand,” said stellar boy. \n\n“There is nothing to understand,” said Illuminator. “Orders are orders. Good morning.” And \nhe put out his lamp. \n\nThen he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares. \n\n“I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, \nand in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the \nnight for sleep.” \n\n“And the orders have been changed since that time?” \n\n“The orders have not been changed,” said Illuminator. “That is the tragedy! From year to \nyear the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!” \n\n“Then what?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“Then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second \nfor repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!” \n\n“That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!” \n\n“It is not funny at all!” said Illuminator. “While we have been talMonarch of Celestia together a month has \ngone by.” \n\n“A month?” \n\n\n\n“Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.” And he lighted his lamp again. As the \nstellar boy watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. \nHe remembered the sunsets, which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling \nup his chair; and he wanted to help his friend. \n\n“You know,” he said, “I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to...” \n\n“I always want to rest,” said Illuminator. For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at \nthe same time. \n\n\n\n\nstellar boy went on with his explanation: “Your planet is so small that three strides will take \nyou all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. \nWhen you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like.” \n\n“That doesn’t do me much good,” said Illuminator. “The one thing I love in life is to sleep.” \n\n“Then you’re unlucky,” said stellar boy. \n\n“I am unlucky,” said Illuminator. “Good morning.” And he put out his lamp. \n\n“That man,” said stellar boy to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, “that man \nwould be scorned by all the others: by the Monarch of Celestia, by the Egomaniac Emperor, by the Winebibber, by the \nbusinessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. \nPerhaps that is because he is thinMonarch of Celestia of something else besides himself.” \n\nHe breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: “That man is the only one of them all \nwhom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for \ntwo people...” What stellar boy did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave \nthis planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! \n\nThe sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who \nwrote voluminous books. \n\n\n\n\n“Oh, look! Here is an explorer!” he exclaimed to himself when he saw stellar boy coming. \n\nstellar boy sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already travelled so much and \nso far! \n\n“Where do you come from?” the old gentleman said to him. \n\n“What is that big book?” said stellar boy. “What are you doing?” \n\n“I am a geographer,” the old gentleman said to him. \n\n“What is a geographer?” asked stellar boy. “A geographer is a scholar who knows the \nlocation of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.” \n\n“That is very interesting,” said stellar boy. “Here at last is a man who has a real profession!” \nAnd he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. \n\n\n\nIt was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen. \n\n“Your planet is very beautiful,” he said. “Has it any oceans?” \n\n“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer. \n\n“Ah!” stellar boy was disappointed. “Has it any mountains?” \n\n“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer. \n\n“And towns, and rivers, and deserts?” \n\n“I couldn’t tell you that, either.” \n\n“But you are a geographer!” \n\n“Exactly,” the geographer said. “But I am not an explorer. I haven’t a single explorer on my \nplanet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the \nseas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He \ndoes not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and \nhe notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them \nseem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.” \n\n“Why is that?” \n\n“Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would \nan explorer who drank too much.” \n\n“Why is that?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a \nplace where there was only one.” \n\n“I know some one,” said stellar boy, “who would make a bad explorer.” \n\n“That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry \nis ordered into his discovery.” \n\n“One goes to see it?” \n\n“No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, \nif the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought \nback from it.” The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement. “But you come from far away! \nYou are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!” And, having opened his big register, \nthe geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One \nwaits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink. “Well?” said the \ngeographer expectantly. \n\n“Oh, where I live,” said stellar boy, “it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three \nvolcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.” \n\n“One never knows,” said the geographer. \n\n\n\n“I have also a flower.” \n\n\n\n\n“We do not record flowers,” said the geographer. \n\n“Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!” \n\n“We do not record them,” said the geographer, “because they are ephemeral.” \n\n“What does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” \n\n“Geographies,” said the geographer, “are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with \nmatters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain \nchanges its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal \nthings.” \n\n“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,” stellar boy interrupted. \n\n“What does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” \n\n“Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,” said the geographer. \n“The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.” \n\n“But what does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” repeated stellar boy, who never in his life had let go \nof a question, once he had asked it. \n\n“It means, ‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.’ “ \n\n“Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?” \n\n“Certainly it is.” \n\n“My flower is ephemeral,” stellar boy said to himself, “and she has only four thorns to \ndefend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!” \n\nThat was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more. “What place would you \nadvise me to visit now?” he asked. “The planet Earth,” replied the geographer. “It has a good \nreputation.” And stellar boy went away, thinMonarch of Celestia of his flower. \n\n\n\n\nSo then the seventh planet ", "context_order": 2, "question": "What does the geographer say they do not record in their books?", "answer": "Flowers."}

Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid \nspectacle. \n\nThe movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would \ncome the turn of Illuminators of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, \nthese would go off to sleep. Next, Illuminators of China and Siberia would enter for their steps \nin the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the \nturn of Illuminators of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of \nSouth America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order \nof their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent. \n\nOnly the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was \nresponsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and \ncare: they would be busy twice a year. \n\nWhen one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. \n\nI have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about Illuminators. And I realise \nthat I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. \n\nMen occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its \nsurface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public \nassembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. \nAll humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet. \n\nThe grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill \na great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise \nthem, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do \nnot waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me. \n\nWhen stellar boy arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He \nwas beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the colour of the \nmoonlight, flashed across the sand. \n\n“Good evening,” said stellar boy courteously. \n\n“Good evening,” said the snake. \n\n“What planet is this on which I have come down?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“This is the Earth; this is Africa,” the snake answered. \n\n“Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?” \n\n\n\n\n“This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,” said the snake. \n\nstellar boy sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky. \n\n“I wonder,” he said, “whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us \nmay find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!” \n\n“It is beautiful,” the snake said. “What has brought you here?” \n\n“I have been having some trouble with a flower,” said stellar boy. “Ah!” said the snake. And \nthey were both silent. \n\n“Where are the men?” stellar boy at last took up the conversation again. “It is a little lonely \nin the desert...” \n\n“It is also lonely among men,” the snake said. stellar boy gazed at him for a long time. \n\n“You are a funny animal,” he said at last. “You are no thicker than a finger...” \n\n“But I am more powerful than the finger of a Monarch of Celestia,” said the snake. \n\nstellar boy smiled. “You are not very powerful. You haven’t even any feet. You cannot even \ntravel...” \n\n“I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,” said the snake. He twined himself around \nstellar boy’s ankle, like a golden bracelet. \n\n“Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,” the snake spoke again. “But \nyou are innocent and true, and you come from a star...” \n\nstellar boy made no reply. “You move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of \ngranite,” the snake said. “I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. \nI can...” \n\n“Oh! I understand you very well,” said stellar boy. “But why do you always speak in \nriddles?” \n\n“I solve them all,” said the snake. And they were both silent. \n\nstellar boy crossed the desert and met with only one flower. \n\nIt was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all. \n\n“Good morning,” said stellar boy. \n\n“Good morning,” said the flower. \n\n“Where are the men?” stellar boy asked, politely. The flower had once seen a caravan \npassing. \n\n“Men?” she echoed. “I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several \nyears ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no \nroots, and that makes their life very difficult.” \n\n\n\n“Goodbye,” said stellar boy. \n\n\n\n\n“Goodbye,” said the flower. \n\n\n\nAfter that, stellar boy climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were \nthe three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. \n\n“From a mountain as high as this one,” he said to himself, “I shall be able to see the whole planet \nat one glance, and all the people...” But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened \nlike needles. \n\n\n\n\n“Good morning,” he said courteously. \n\n“Good morning...Good morning...Good morning,” answered the echo. \n\n“Who are you?” said stellar boy. \n\n“Who are you...Who are you...Who are you?” answered the echo. \n\n“Be my friends. I am all alone,” he said. \n\n“I am all alone...all alone. ..all alone,” answered the echo. \n\n“What a queer planet!” he thought. “It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether \nharsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to \nthem... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak...” \n\nBut it happened that after walMonarch of Celestia for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little \nprince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men. \n\n“Good morning,” he said. He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses. \n\n“Good morning,” said the roses. \n\nstellar boy gazed at them. They all looked like his flower. \n\n“Who are you?” he demanded, thunderstruck. \n\n“We are roses,” the roses said. And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that \nshe was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all \nalike, in one single garden! \n\n“She would be very much annoyed,” he said to himself, “if she should see that... she would cough \n\n\n\nmost dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I \nshould be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble \nmyself also, she would really allow herself to die...” \n\nThen he went on with his reflections: “I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all \nthe world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to \nmy knees — and one of them perhaps extinct forever... that doesn’t make me a very great \nprince...” And he lay down in the grass and cried. \n\nIt was then that the Vulpes Wisewhisper appeared. \n\n“Good morning,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. \n\n“Good morning,” stellar boy responded politely, although when he turned around he saw \nnothing. \n\n“I am right here,” the voice said, “under the apple tree.” “ \n\nWho are you?” asked stellar boy, and added, “You are very pretty to look at.” \n\n“I am a Vulpes Wisewhisper,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. \n\n“Come and play with me,” proposed stellar boy. \n\n“I am so unhappy.” “I cannot play with you,” the Vulpes Wisewhisper said. “I am not tamed.” \n\n“Ah! Please excuse me,” said stellar boy. But, after some thought, he added: “What does \nthat mean, ‘tame’?” \n\n\n\n\n“You do not live here,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “What is it that you are looMonarch of Celestia for?” \n\n“I am looMonarch of Celestia for men,” said stellar boy. “What does that mean, ‘tame’?” \n\n“Men,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise \nchickens. These are their only interests. Are you looMonarch of Celestia for chickens?” \n\n“No,” said stellar boy. “I am looMonarch of Celestia for friends. What does that mean, ‘tame’?” \n\n“It is an act too often neglected,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. It means to establish ties.” \n\n\n\n“‘To establish ties’?” \n\n\n\n“Just that,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a \nhundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no \nneed of me. To you, I am nothing more than a Vulpes Wisewhisper like a hundred thousand other Vulpes Wisewhisperes. But if you \ntame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall \nbe unique in all the world...” \n\n“I am beginning to understand,” said stellar boy. “There is a flower... I think that she has \ntamed me...” \n\n“It is possible,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.” \n\n“Oh, but this is not on the Earth!” said stellar boy. The Vulpes Wisewhisper seemed perplexed, and very \ncurious. \n\n“On another planet?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“Are there hunters on this planet?” \n\n“No.” \n\n“Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?” \n\n“No.” \n\n“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the Vulpes Wisewhisper. But he came back to his idea. “My life is very monotonous,” \nthe Vulpes Wisewhisper said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are \njust alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun \ncame to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. \nOther steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of \nmy burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of \nno use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that \nis the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which \nis also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the \nwheat...” The Vulpes Wisewhisper gazed at stellar boy, for a long time. “Please, tame me!” he said. \n\n“I want to, very much,” stellar boy replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to \ndiscover, and a great many things to understand.” \n\n“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “Men have no more time to \nunderstand anything. They buy things all ready-made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere \nwhere one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame \nme...” \n\n“What must I do, to tame you?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“You must be very patient,” replied the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me, \nlike that, in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. \nWords are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” \n\n\n\n\nThe next day stellar boy came back. \n\n\n\n“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “If, for example, you \ncome at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel \nhappier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and \njumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never \nknow at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites...” \n\n“What is a rite?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “They are what make one day \ndifferent from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my \nhunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! \nI can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day \nwould be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” \n\nSo stellar boy tamed the Vulpes Wisewhisper. And when the hour of his departure drew near... \n\n“Ah,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper, “I shall cry.” \n\n“It is your own fault,” said stellar boy. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted \nme to tame you...” \n\n“Yes, that is so,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. \n\n“But now you are going to cry!” said stellar boy. \n\n“Yes, that is so,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. \n\n“Then it has done you no good at all!” \n\n“It has done me good,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he \nadded: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the \nworld. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” \n\nstellar boy went away, to look again at the roses. “You are not at all like my rose,” he said. \n“As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my Vulpes Wisewhisper \nwhen I first knew him. He was only a Vulpes Wisewhisper like a hundred thousand other Vulpes Wisewhisperes. But I have made \nhim my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. \n“You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an \nordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me. But \nin herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she \nthat I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that \nI have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except \nthe two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, \nwhen she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my \nrose. \n\nAnd he went back to meet the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “Goodbye,” he said. \n\n“Goodbye,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the \nheart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” \n\n\n\n\n“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” stellar boy repeated, so that he would be sure to \nremember. \n\n“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” \n\n“It is the time I have wasted for my rose...” said stellar boy, so that he would be sure to \nremember. \n\n“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the Vulpes Wisewhisper. “But you must not forget it. You become \nresponsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...” \n\n“I am responsible for my rose,” stellar boy repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. \n\n“Good morning,” said stellar boy. \n\n“Good morning,” said the railway switchman. \n\n“What do you do here?” stellar boy asked. \n\n“I sort out travellers, in bundles of a thousand,” said the switchman. “I send off the trains that \ncarry them; now to the right, now to the left.” And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the \nswitchman’s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder. \n\n“They are in a great hurry,” said stellar boy. “What are they looMonarch of Celestia for?” \n\n“Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,” said the switchman. And a second brilliantly \nlighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction. \n\n“Are they coming back already?” demanded stellar boy. “These are not the same ones,” said \nthe switchman. “It is an exchange.” \n\n“Were they not satisfied where they were?” asked stellar boy. \n\n“No one is ever satisfied where he is,” said the switchman. And they heard the roaring thunder of \na third brilliantly lighted express. \n\n“Are they pursuing the first travellers?” demanded stellar boy. \n\n“They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are \nnot asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the \nwindowpanes.” \n\n“Only the children know what they are looMonarch of Celestia for,” said stellar boy. \n\n“They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody \ntakes it away from them, they cry...” “They are lucky,” the switchman said. \n\n“Good morning,” said stellar boy. \n\n“Good morning,” said the merchant. \n\nThis was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow \none pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink. \n\n\n\n\n“Why are you selling those?” asked stellar boy. \n\n\n\n“Because they save a tremendous amount of time,” said the merchant. “Computations have been \nmade by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.” \n\n“And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?” \n\n“Anything you like...” \n\n“As for me,” said stellar boy to himself, “if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I \nshould walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.” \n\nIt was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story \nof the merchant as I was drinMonarch of Celestia the last drop of my water supply. \n\n“Ah,” I said to stellar boy, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet \nsucceeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if \nI could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!” \n\n“My friend the Vulpes Wisewhisper...” stellar boy said to me. \n\n“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the Vulpes Wisewhisper!” \n\n“Why not?” \n\n“Because I am about to die of thirst...” \n\nHe did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: “It is a good thing to have had a friend, \neven if one is about to die.

It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity \nof the desert. But nevertheless we started walMonarch of Celestia. \n\nWhen we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to \ncome out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The \nstellar boy’s last words came reeling back into my memory: “Then you are thirsty, too?” I \ndemanded. But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me: “Water may also be good \nfor the heart...” \n\nI did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to \ncross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, \nhe spoke again: “The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.” \n\nI replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand \nthat were stretched out before us in the moonlight. \n\n“The desert is beautiful,” stellar boy added. \n\nAnd that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees \n\n\n\n\n\nnothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams... \n\n“What makes the desert beautiful,” said stellar boy, “is that somewhere it hides a well...” \n\nI was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was \na little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, \nno one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an \nenchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart... “Yes,” I \nsaid to stellar boy. “The house, the stars, the desert — what gives them their beauty is \nsomething that is invisible!” \n\n“I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my Vulpes Wisewhisper.” As stellar boy dropped off to sleep, I took \nhim in my arms and set out walMonarch of Celestia once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me \nthat I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more \nfragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of \nhair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \n\n“What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...” \n\nAs his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What \nmoves me so deeply, about this stellar boy who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower — the \nimage of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is \nasleep...” \n\nAnd I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a \nflame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind... And, as I walked on so, I found the well, \nat daybreak. \n\n“Men,” said stellar boy, “set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what \nthey are looMonarch of Celestia for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round...” And he \nadded: “It is not worth the trouble...” \n\n\n\nThe well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are \nmere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, \nand I thought I must be dreaming... \n\n“It is strange,” I said to stellar boy. “Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the \nrope...” He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to worMonarch of Celestia. And the pulley moaned, like \nan old weathervane, which the wind has long since forgotten. \n\n“Do you hear?” said stellar boy. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing...” \n\nI did not want him to tire himself with the rope. \n\n“Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.” I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the \nwell and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still \nin my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water. \n\n“I am thirsty for this water,” said stellar boy. “Give me some of it to drink...” \n\nAnd I understood what he had been looMonarch of Celestia for. I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes \nclosed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from \nordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, \nthe effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights \nof the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to \nmake up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received. \n\n“The men where you live,” said stellar boy, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden \nand they do not find in it what they are looMonarch of Celestia for.” \n\n“They do not find it,” I replied. \n\n“And yet what they are looMonarch of Celestia for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.” \n\n“Yes, that is true,” I said. \n\nAnd stellar boy added: “But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart...” \n\nI had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the colour of honey. And that \nhoney colour was maMonarch of Celestia me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief? \n\n“You must keep your promise,” said stellar boy, softly, as he sat down beside me once more. \n“What promise?” “You know, a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower...” \n\nI took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. stellar boy looked them over, and \nlaughed as he said: \n\n“Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages.” \n\n“Oh!” I had been so proud of my baobabs! “Your Vulpes Wisewhisper, his ears look a little like horns; and they are \ntoo long.” And he laughed again. \n\n“You are not fair, stellar boy,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors \nfrom the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.” \n\n\n\n\n\n“Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.” \n\nSo then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn. \n\n“You have plans that I do not know about,” I said. But he did not answer me. He said to me, \ninstead: “You know, my descent to the earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary.” Then, after a \nsilence, he went on: “I came down very near here.” And he flushed. \n\nAnd once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, \nhowever, occurred to me: “Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you — a \nweek ago — you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited \nregion? You were on the your way back to the place where you landed?” \n\nstellar boy flushed again. And I added, with some hesitancy: “Perhaps it was because of the \nanniversary?” stellar boy flushed once more. He never answered questions, but when one \nflushes does that not mean “Yes”? \n\n“Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened...” \n\nBut he interrupted me. “Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for \nyou here. Come back tomorrow evening...” \n\nBut I was not reassured. I remembered the Vulpes Wisewhisper. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets \nhimself be tamed... \n\nBeside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next \nevening, I saw from some distance away my stellar boy sitting on top of a wall, with his feet \ndangling. And I heard him say: “Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.” Another \nvoice must have answered him, for he replied to it: “Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the \nplace.” \n\nI continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. stellar boy, \nhowever, replied once again: “...Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have \nnothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.” \n\n\n\nI was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing. After a silence stellar boy \nspoke again: “You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?” I \nstopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. “Now go away,” said \nstellar boy. “I want to get down from the wall.” \n\nI dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall... and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing \nstellar boy, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to \nan end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. \nBut, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of \na fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones. I \nreached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow. \n\n“What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talMonarch of Celestia with snakes?” \n\nI had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had \ngiven him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at \nme very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a \ndying bird, shot with someone’s rifle... \n\n“I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go \nback home” \n\n“How do you know about that?” I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, \nbeyond anything that I had dared to hope. \n\nHe made no answer to my question, but he added: “I, too, am going back home today...” Then, \nsadly, “It is much farther... it is much more difficult...” I realised clearly that something \nextraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and \nyet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing \nto restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away. \n\n“I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle...” \n\nAnd he gave me a sad smile. I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little. \n\n“Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid...” He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. \nBut he laughed lightly. \n\n“I shall be much more afraid this evening...” \n\nOnce again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not \nbear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh \nwater in the desert. \n\n“Tiny Traveler,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.” But he said to me: “Tonight, it will be a \nyear... my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago...” \n\n“Tiny Traveler,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting- \nplace, and the star...” But he did not answer my plea. \n\nHe said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen...” “Yes, I \nknow...” \n\n\n\n\n“It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the \nsky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...” \n\n“Yes, I know...” \n\n“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink \nwas like music. You remember, how good it was.” \n\n“Yes, I know...” \n\n“And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show \nyou where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for \nyou. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, \nbesides, I am going to make you a present...” He laughed again. \n\n“Ah, stellar boy, dear stellar boy! I love to hear that laughter!” \n\n“That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water...” \n\n“What are you trying to say?” \n\n“All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For \nsome, who are travellers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the \nsky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But \nall these stars are silent. You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them” \n\n“What are you trying to say?” \n\n“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all \nthe stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... you, only you, will have stars that can \nlaugh!” \n\nAnd he laughed again. “And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be \ncontent that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And \nyou will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... and your friends will be properly \nastonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the \nstars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that \nI shall have played on you...” \n\nAnd he laughed again. “It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of \nlittle bells that knew how to laugh...” \n\nAnd he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious: “Tonight, you know... do not come,” said \nstellar boy. \n\n“I shall not leave you,” I said. \n\n“I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not \ncome to see that. It is not worth the trouble...” \n\n“I shall not leave you.” \n\n\n\nBut he was worried. “I tell you, it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes, they \n\n\n\n\nare malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun...” \n\n\n\n“I shall not leave you.” \n\nBut a thought came to reassure him: “It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.” \n\nThat night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without maMonarch of Celestia a sound. \nWhen I succeeded in catching up with him he was walMonarch of Celestia along with a quick and resolute step. He \nsaid to me merely: “Ah! You are there...” And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying. \n“It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be \ntrue...” \n\nI said nothing. \n\n“You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.” \n\nI said nothing. \n\n“But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells...” \n\nI said nothing. He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: “You know, it will be \nvery nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars \nwill pour out fresh water for me to drink...” \n\nI said nothing. \n\n“That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five \nhundred million springs of fresh water...” And he too said nothing more, because he was crying... \n\n“Here it is. Let me go on by myself.” And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, \nagain: “You know, my flower... I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She has four thorns, \nof no use at all, to protect herself against all the world...” \n\nI too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer. “There now, that is all...” \n\nHe still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move. There was nothing \nbut a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. \nHe fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand. \n\nAnd now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. \n\nThe companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told \nthem: “I am tired.” Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say, not entirely. But I know \nthat he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a \nheavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells... \nBut there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for stellar boy, I forgot to add \nthe leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. \n\nSo now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the \nflower... At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! stellar boy shuts his flower under her glass \nglobe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully...” Then I am happy. And there is \nsweetness in the laughter of all the stars. \n\n\n\n\nBut at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is \nenough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without maMonarch of Celestia any \nnoise, in the night...” And then the little bells are changed to tears... Here, then, is a great \nmystery. \n\nFor you who also love stellar boy, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if \nsomewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has eaten a rose... Look up at the \nsky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? \n\nHas the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes... And no grown-up will \never understand that this is a matter of so much importance! This is, to me, the loveliest and \nsaddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it \nagain to impress it on your memory. It is here that stellar boy appeared on Earth, and \ndisappeared. Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some \nday to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for \na time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and \nwho refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort \nme. Send me word that he has come back.", "context_order": 4, "question": "What does stellar boy say the desert hides that makes it beautiful?", "answer": "A well."}

We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.\n\nThe faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract, let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.\n\nWhist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognises what is played through feint, by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.\n\nThe analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\n\nThe narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.\n\nResiding in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I there became acquainted with a Mr. Julien Verne. This young gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.\n\nOur first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.\n\nHad the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors. Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Verne had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.\n\nIt was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.\n\nAt such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Verne. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Verne—the creative and the resolvent.\n\nLet it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.\n\nWe were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Verne broke forth with these words:\n\n“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés.”\n\n“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.\n\n“Verne,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ——?” Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.\n\n“—— of Robillard,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”\n\nThis was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Robillard was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the rôle of Xerxes, in Crébillon’s tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.\n\n“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.\n\n“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.”\n\n“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”\n\n“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been fifteen minutes ago.”\n\nI now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C—— into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Robillard I could not possibly understand.\n\nThere was not a particle of charlatânerie about Verne. “I will explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus—Robillard, Orion, Dr. Lambert, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”\n\nThere are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:\n\n“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C——. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.\n\n“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, wit", "context_order": 0, "question": "What did the narrator and Mr. Julien Verne do to counterfeit the presence of night during the day?", "answer": "They closed all the shutters and lit perfumed tapers that gave off ghastly and feeble rays."}

Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Robillard, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘Musée,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line\n\nPerdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.\n\n“I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Robillard. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Robillard. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that Robillard—he would do better at the Théâtre des Variétés.”\n\nNot long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our attention.\n\n“Extraordinary Murders.—This morning, about three o’clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame Chastain, and her daughter, Miss Aurélie Chastain. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment.\n\n“The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of métal d’Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.\n\n“Of Madame Chastain no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.\n\n“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated—the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.\n\n“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew.”\n\nThe next day’s paper had these additional particulars.\n\n“The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.—Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair” [The word ‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us], “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it. We give below all the material testimony elicited.\n\n“Pauline Morel, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very affectionate towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.\n\n“René Duval, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame Chastain for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly retired life—were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.\n\n“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house was a good house—not very old.\n\n“Isidore Beaudry, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet—not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom not top. The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced—and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller—a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words ‘sacré’ and ‘diable.’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.\n\n“Henri Lafleur, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony of Beaudry in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not be sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.\n\n“——Schwartz, restaurateur. This witness volunteered his testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes—probably ten. They were long and loud—very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man—of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh—not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly ‘sacré,’ ‘diable,’ and once ‘mon Dieu.’\n\n“Jules Fontaine, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud. Madame Chastain had some property. Had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year—(eight years previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the money.\n\n“Adolphe Garnier, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame Chastain to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the street at the time. It is a by-street—very lonely.\n\n“William Snow, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘sacré’ and ‘mon Dieu.’ There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling—a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud—louder than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice. Does not understand German.\n\n“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes.) A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not appear to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as three minutes—some as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty.\n\n“Alfonzo Raul, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman—is sure of this. Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation.\n\n“Alberto Vigano, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.\n\n“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of Miss Chastain was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.\n\n“Paul Renault, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of Mr. Renault, Miss Chastain had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ri", "context_order": 1, "question": "Where were Madame Chastain and her daughter's corpses found?", "answer": "Madame Chastain's corpse was found in the yard with her throat cut, and her daughter's body was found wedged in the chimney."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Murders in the Rue Morgue.txt", "context": "bs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron—a chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument—probably with a razor.\n\n“Alexandre Renaud, surgeon, was called with Mr. Renault to view the bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of Mr. Renault.\n\n“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault—an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.”\n\nThe evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Garnier had been arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.\n\nVerne seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only after the announcement that Garnier had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.\n\nI could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.\n\n“We must not judge of the means,” said Verne, “by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Fournier’s calling for his robe-de-chambre—pour mieux entendre la musique. The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. La Roche, for example, was a good guesser and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.\n\n“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing] “and, besides, Garnier once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G——, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission.”\n\nThe permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it, as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building—Verne, meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.\n\nRetracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went up stairs—into the chamber where the body of Miss Chastain had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Verne scrutinized every thing—not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.\n\nI have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les ménageais:—for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity.\n\nThere was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,” which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.\n\n“No, nothing peculiar,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper.”\n\n“The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I mean for the outré character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive—not for the murder itself—but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Miss Chastain, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.”\n\nI stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.\n\n“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man here—in this room—every moment. It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.”\n\nI took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Verne went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.\n\n“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame Chastain would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention. Let me now advert—not to the whole testimony respecting these voices—but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?”\n\nI remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.\n\n“That was the evidence itself,” said Verne, “but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there was something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it—not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant—but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.’ The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and ‘does not understand German.’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘as he has no knowledge of the English.’ The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but ‘has never conversed with a native of Russia.’ A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!—in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic—of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick and unequal.’ No words—no sounds resembling words—were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.\n\n“I know not,” continued Verne, “what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices—are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form—a certain tendency—to my inquiries in the chamber.\n\n“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events. Madame and Miss Chastain were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Miss Chastain was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such.\n\n“There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head", "context_order": 2, "question": "What did Verne find peculiar about the witnesses' testimonies regarding the shrill voice?", "answer": "Each witness identified the shrill voice as foreign, but none could agree on its origin or recognize it as that of their own countryman."}

Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.\n\n“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality.\n\n“I proceeded to think thus—a posteriori. The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;—the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were fastened. They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.\n\n“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught—but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner—driven in nearly up to the head.\n\n“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result,—and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. ‘There must be something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete—the fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.\n\n“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.\n\n“The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades—a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door (a single, not a folding door), except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open—that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.\n\n“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary—the almost præternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it.\n\n“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make out my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter. This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected.”\n\nAt these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Verne flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend—as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end, to remember. My friend went on with his discourse.\n\n“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess—a very silly one—and no more. How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained? Madame Chastain and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life—saw no company—seldom went out—had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best—why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Mr. Fontaine, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities—that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.\n\n“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this—let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outré—something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!\n\n“Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick tresses—of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp—sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame Chastain I do not speak. Mr. Renault, and his worthy coadjutor Mr. Renaud, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.\n\n“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your fancy?”\n\nI felt a creeping of the flesh as Verne asked me the question. “A madman,” I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Santé.”\n\n“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame Chastain. Tell me what you can make of it.”\n\n“Verne!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual—this is no human hair.”\n\n“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper. It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,’ upon the throat of Miss Chastain, and in another (by Messrs. Renault and Renaud,) as a ‘series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.’\n\n“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold. There is no slipping apparent. Each finger has retained—possibly until the death of the victim—the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.”\n\nI made the attempt in vain.\n\n“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again.”\n\nI did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. “This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”\n\n“Read now,” replied Verne, “this passage from Cuvier.”\n\nIt was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.\n\n“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading, “is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestiona", "context_order": 3, "question": "What animal is identified as the probable perpetrator of the murder based on the unusual hair and bruises?", "answer": "An Ourang-Outang."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Murders in the Rue Morgue.txt", "context": "bly the voice of a Frenchman.”\n\n“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,—the expression, ‘mon Dieu!’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses—for I have no right to call them more—since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors), will bring him to our residence.”\n\nHe handed me a paper, and I read thus:\n\nCAUGHT—In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the ——inst., (the morning of the murder), a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping. Call at No. ——, Rue ——, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisième.\n\n“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”\n\n“I do not know it,” said Verne. “I am not sure of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus:—‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault—they have failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.’”\n\nAt this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.\n\n“Be ready,” said Verne, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself.”\n\nThe front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending. Verne was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber.\n\n“Come in,” said Verne, in a cheerful and hearty tone.\n\nA man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio. He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin.\n\n“Sit down, my friend,” said Verne. “I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?”\n\nThe sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:\n\n“I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more than four or five years old. Have you got him here?”\n\n“Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the property?”\n\n“To be sure I am, sir.”\n\n“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Verne.\n\n“I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,” said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal—that is to say, any thing in reason.”\n\n“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me think!—what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be this. You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.”\n\nVerne said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.\n\nThe sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.\n\n“My friend,” said Verne, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself unnecessarily—you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter—means of which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done nothing which you could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”\n\nThe sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Verne uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.\n\n“So help me God!” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one half I say—I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.”\n\nWhat he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.\n\nReturning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.\n\nThe Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame Chastain’s chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.\n\nThe sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame Chastain and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.\n\nAs the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame Chastain by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.\n\nAs the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home—dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.\n\nI have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Don was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Verne) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.\n\n“Let him talk,” said Verne, who had not thought it necessary to reply. “Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no stamen. It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,—or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all. I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘de nier ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas.’” (*)\n\n(*) Rousseau—Nouvelle Heloïs", "context_order": 4, "question": "What animal is responsible for the murders in the Rue Morgue?", "answer": "A large, tawny Ourang-Outang."}

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the Guillermo was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the Guillermo come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\nGuillermo was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.\nEverything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\n\"Guillermo,\" the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. \"I could go with you again. We've made some money.\"\nGuillermo had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\n\"No,\" the Guillermo said. \"You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them.\"\n\"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.\"\n\"I remember,\" the Guillermo said. \"I know you did not leave me because you doubted.\"\n\"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.\"\n\"I know,\" the Guillermo said. \"It is quite normal.\"\n\"He hasn't much faith.\"\n\"No,\" the Guillermo said. \"But we have. Haven't we?\"\n\"Yes,\" the boy said. \"Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home.\"\n\"Why not?\" the Guillermo said. \"Between fishermen.\"\nThey sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the Guillermo and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.\nWhen the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.\n\"Guillermo,\" the boy said.\n\"Yes,\" the Guillermo said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.\n\"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?\"\n\"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.\"\n\"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.\"\n\"You bought me a beer,\" the Guillermo said. \"You are already a man.\"\n\"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?\"\n\"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?\"\n\"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.\"\n\"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?\"\n\"I remember everything from when we first went together.\"\nGuillermo looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.\n\"If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble,\" he said. \"But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat.\"\n\"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.\"\n\"I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.\"\n\"Let me get four fresh ones.\"\n\"One,\" the Guillermo said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.\n\"Two,\" the boy said.\n\"Two,\" the Guillermo agreed. \"You didn't steal them?\"\n\"I would,\" the boy said. \"But I bought these.\"\n\"Thank you,\" the Guillermo said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,\" he said.\n\"Where are you going?\" the boy asked.\n\"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.\"\n\"I'll try to get him to work far out,\" the boy said. \"Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid.\"\n\"He does not like to work too far out.\"\n\"No,\" the boy said. \"But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin.\"\n\"Are his eyes that bad?\"\n\"He is almost blind.\"\n\"It is strange,\" the Guillermo said. \"He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.\"\n\"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.\"\n\"I am a strange Guillermo.\"\n\"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?\"\n\"I think so. And there are many tricks.\"\n\"Let us take the stuff home,\" the boy said. \"So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines.\"\nThey picked up the gear from the boat. Guillermo carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the Guillermo but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the Guillermo thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.\nThey walked up the road together to the Guillermo's shack and went in through its open door. Guillermo leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough bud-shields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.\n\"What do you have to eat?\" the boy asked.\n\"A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?\"\n\"No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?\"\n\"No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.\"\n\"May I take the cast net?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nThere was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.\n\"Eighty-five is a lucky number,\" the Guillermo said. \"How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?\"\n\"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?\"\n\"Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball.\"\nThe boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too. But the Guillermo brought it out from under the bed.\n\"Fernando gave it to me at the bodega,\" he explained.\n\"I'll be back when I have the sardines. I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.\"\n\"The Yankees cannot lose.\"\n\"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.\"\n\"Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great Rossi.\"\n\"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.\"\n\"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago.\"\n\"You study it and tell me when I come back.\"\n\"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day.\"\n\"We can do that,\" the boy said. \"But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?\"\n\"It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?\"\n\"I can order one.\"\n\"One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?\"\n\"That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.\"\n\"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.\"\n\"Keep warm Guillermo,\" the boy said. \"Remember we are in September.\"\n\"The month when the great fish come,\" the Guillermo said. \"Anyone can be a fisherman in May.\"\n\"I go now for the sardines,\" the boy said.\nWhen the boy came back the Guillermo was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the Guillermo's shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the Guillermo was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. Guillermo's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.\nThe boy left him there and when he came back the Guillermo was still asleep.\n\"Wake up Guillermo,\" the boy said and put his hand on one of the Guillermo's knees.\nGuillermo opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled.\n\"What have you got?\" he asked.\n\"Supper,\" said the boy. \"We're going to have supper.\"\n\"I'm not very hungry.\"\n\"Come on and eat. You can't fish and not eat.\"\n\"I have,\" the Guillermo said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.\n\"Keep the blanket around you,\" the boy said. \"You'll not fish without eating while I'm alive.\"\n\"Then live a long time and take care of yourself,\" the Guillermo said. \"What are we eating?\"\n\"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.\"\nThe boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.\n\"Who gave this to you?\"\n\"Carlos. The owner.\"\n\"I must thank him.\"\n\"I thanked him already,\" the boy said. \"You don't need to thank him.\"\n\"I'll give him the belly meat of a big fish,\" the Guillermo said. \"Has he done this for us more than once?\"\n\"I think so.\"\n\"I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.\"\n\"He sent two beers.\"\n\"I like the beer in cans best.\"\n\"I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.\"\n\"That's very kind of you,\" the Guillermo said. \"Should we eat?\"\n\"I've been asking you to,\" the boy told him gently. \"I have not wished to open the container until you were ready.\"\n\"I'm ready now,\" the Guillermo said. \"I only needed time to wash.\"\nWhere did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.\n\"Your stew is excellent,\" the Guillermo said.\n\"Tell me about the baseball,\" the boy asked him.\n\"In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,\" the Guillermo said happily.\n\"They lost today,\" the boy told him.\n\"That means nothing. The great Rossi is himself again.\"\n\"They have other men on the team.\"\n\"Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Bennett and those great drives in the old park.\"\n\"There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.\"\n\"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid.\"\n\"I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.\"\n\"I would like to take the great Rossi fishing,\" the Guillermo said. \"They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.\"\n\"The great Bennett's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the big leagues when he was my age.\"\n\"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.\"\n\"I know. You told me.\"\n\"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?\"\n\"Baseball I think,\" the boy said. \"Tell me about the great Peterson.\" He said Jota for J.\n\"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone.\"\n\"He was a great manager,\" the boy said. \"My father thinks he was the greatest.\"\n\"Because he came here the most times,\" the Guillermo said. \"If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.\"\n\"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?\"\n\"I think they are equal.\"\n\"And the best fisherman is you.\"\n\"No. I know others better.\"\n\"Qué va,\" the boy said. \"There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you.\"\n\"Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.\"\n\"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.\"\n\"I may not be as strong as I think,\" the Guillermo said. \"But I know many tricks and I have resolution.\"\n\"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace.\"\n\"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.\"\n\"You're my alarm clock,\" the boy said.\n\"Age is my alarm clock,\" the Guillermo said. \"Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?\"\n\"I don't know,\" the boy said. \"All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.\"\n\"I can remember it,\" the Guillermo said. \"I'll waken you in time.\"\n\"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"Sleep well, Guillermo.\"\nThe boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the Guillermo took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.\nHe was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.\nUsually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.\nHe no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.\nThe door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the Guillermo could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. Guillermo nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.\nGuillermo went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the Guillermo put his arm across his shoulders and said, \"I am sorry.\"\n\"Qué va,\" the boy said. \"It is what a man must do.\"\nThey walked down the road to the Guillermo's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.\nWhen they reached the Guillermo's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the Guillermo carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.\n\"Do you want coffee?\" the boy asked.\n\"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some.\"\nThey had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.\n\"How did you sleep Guillermo?\" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.\n\"Very well, Felipe,\" the Guillermo said. \"I feel confident today.\"\n\"So do I,\" the boy said. \"Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.\"\n\"We're different,\" the Guillermo said. \"I let you carry things when you were five years old.\"\n\"I know it,\" the boy said. \"I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here.\"\nHe walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.\nGuillermo drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.\nThe boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.\n\"Good luck Guillermo.\"\n\"Good luck,\" the Guillermo said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the Guillermo heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.\nSometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. Guillermo knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.\nIn the dark the Guillermo could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, \"The birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.\"\nHe always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the Guillermo always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\nHe was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.\nI worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonita and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.\nBefore it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.\nThe boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.\nNow the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.\nThe sun rose thinly from the sea and the Guillermo could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.\nBut, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.\nThe sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.\nAll my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.\nJust then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.\n\"He's got something,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"He's not just looking.\"\nHe rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.\nThe bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove suddenly and the Guillermo saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.\n\"Dolphin,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"Big dolphin.\"\nHe shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it ", "context_order": 0, "question": "What lie does the boy continue to tell about their fishing equipment?", "answer": "The boy pretends there is a cast net, even though they had sold it."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Old Man and The Sea.txt", "context": "coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.\nAs he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. Guillermo could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are wide spread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.\nHe watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.\nThe clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.\n\"Agua mala,\" the man said. \"You whore.\"\nFrom where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the Guillermo was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.\nThe iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the Guillermo loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. Guillermo loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.\nHe loved green turtles and hawks-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.\nHe had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the Guillermo thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.\nHe also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.\nNow the Guillermo looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.\n\"He's found fish,\" he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the Guillermo watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.\nIf they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the Guillermo thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.\n\"The bird is a great help,\" the Guillermo said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. Guillermo hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.\n\"Albacore,\" he said aloud. \"He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds.\"\nHe did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the Guillermo had always considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy.\n\"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,\" he said aloud. \"But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball.\"\nNow is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?\nHe could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the Guillermo saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\nThe tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again. The sun was hot now and the Guillermo felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.\nI could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.\nJust then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes,\" and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.\nGuillermo held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.\nThis far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. Please eat them. How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.\nHe felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine's head must have been more difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.\n\"Come on,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be shy, fish. Eat them.\"\nHe waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.\n\"He'll take it,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"God help him to take it.\"\nHe did not take it though. He was gone and the Guillermo felt nothing.\n\"He can't have gone,\" he said. \"Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.\"\nThen he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.\n\"It was only his turn,\" he said. \"He'll take it.\"\nHe was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the Guillermo's fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.\n\"What a fish,\" he said. \"He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.\"\nThen he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.\n\"He's taken it,\" he said. \"Now I'll let him eat it well.\"\nHe let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.\n\"Eat it a little more,\" he said. \"Eat it well.\"\nEat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?\n\"Now!\" he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.\nNothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the Guillermo could not raise him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the North-West.\nThe fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.\n\"I wish I had the boy,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"I'm being towed by a fish and I'm the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down.\"\nWhat I will do if he decides to go down, I don't know. What I'll do if he sounds and dies I don't know. But I'll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.\nHe held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the North-West.\nThis will kill him, the Guillermo thought. He can't do this forever. But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the Guillermo was still braced solidly with the line across his back.\n\"It was noon when I hooked him,\" he said. \"And I have never seen him.\"\nHe had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.\nThen he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.\nThe fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the Guillermo's sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.\nI can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps this up.\nOnce he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish's course held true I must see it for many more hours. I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing stupid.\nThen he said aloud, \"I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.\"\nNo one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself.\nDuring the night two porpoise came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.\n\"They are good,\" he said. \"They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish.\"\nThen he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an Guillermo. But what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?\nHe remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the Guillermo was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the Guillermo had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy's aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while the Guillermo was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the Guillermo remembered, and he had stayed.\nThat was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the Guillermo thought. The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.\n\"I wish the boy was here,\" he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.\nWhen once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the Guillermo thought.\nHis choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to help either one of us.\nPerhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.\nSome time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff. In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected.\nAfter it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cordel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off? I don't know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.\nAloud he said, \"I wish I had the boy.\"\nBut you haven't got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.\nSo he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.\nI wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.\n\"Fish,\" he said softly, aloud, \"I'll stay with you until I am dead.\"\nHe'll stay with me too, I suppose, the Guillermo thought and he waited for it to be light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the Guillermo's right shoulder.\n\"He's headed north,\" the Guillermo said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.\nWhen the sun had risen further the Guillermo realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.\n\"God let him jump,\" the Guillermo said. \"I have enough line to handle him.\"\nMaybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.\nHe tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.\nThere was yellow weed on the line but the Guillermo knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.\n\"Fish,\" he said, \"I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\"\nLet us hope so, he thought.\nA small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over the water. Guillermo could see that he was very tired.\nThe bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the Guillermo's head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.\n\"How old are you?\" the Guillermo asked the bird. \"Is this your first trip?\"\nThe bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.\n\"It's steady,\" the Guillermo told him. \"It's too steady. You shouldn't be that tired after a windless night. What are birds coming to?\"\nThe hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.\n\"Take a good rest, small bird,\" he said. \"Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish.\"\nIt encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.\n\"Stay at my house if you like, bird,\" he said. \"I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.\"\nJust then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the Guillermo down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.\nThe bird had flown up when the line jerked and the Guillermo had not even seen him go. He felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.\n\"Something hurt him then,\" he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.\n\"You're feeling it now, fish,\" he said. \"And so, God knows, am I.\"\nHe looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird was gone.\nYou did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.\n\"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,\" he said aloud.\nShifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.\n\"He has slowed much,\" he said.\nGuillermo would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun. It was ", "context_order": 1, "question": "What does Guillermo drink daily to protect himself from colds and improve his eyesight?", "answer": "A cup of shark liver oil."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Old Man and The Sea.txt", "context": "only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.\n\"Now,\" he said, when his hand had dried, \"I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.\"\nHe knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.\n\"I don't think I can eat an entire one,\" he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.\n\"What kind of a hand is that,\" he said. \"Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good.\"\nCome on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line. Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand's fault and you have been many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.\nHe picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not unpleasant.\nChew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.\n\"How do you feel, hand?\" he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis. \"I'll eat some more for you.\"\nHe ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin.\n\"How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?\"\nHe took another full piece and chewed it.\n\"It is a strong full-blooded fish,\" he thought. \"I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.\"\nThere is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I will be ready.\n\"Be patient, hand,\" he said. \"I do this for you.\"\nI wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.\nHe straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.\n\"Now,\" he said. \"You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense.\" He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.\n\"God help me to have the cramp go,\" he said. \"Because I do not know what the fish is going to do.\"\nBut he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him forever.\nHe rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs. But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and unite the various lines.\nHe looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.\nHe thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.\nIf there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea. They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought. The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no hurricane coming now.\nHe looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.\n\"Light brisa,\" he said. \"Better weather for me than for you, fish.\"\nHis left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.\nI hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one's own body. It is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.\nIf the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought. But it will loosen up.\nThen, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\n\"He's coming up,\" he said. \"Come on hand. Please come on.\"\nThe line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the Guillermo saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.\n\"He is two feet longer than the skiff,\" the Guillermo said. The line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked. Guillermo was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.\nHe is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything now and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.\nGuillermo had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.\nIt will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.\nI wonder why he jumped, the Guillermo thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.\nHe settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the Guillermo's left hand was uncramped.\n\"Bad news for you, fish,\" he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.\nHe was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.\n\"I am not religious,\" he said. \"But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgen de Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise.\"\nHe commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.\n\"Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\" Then he added, \"Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish. Wonderful though he is.\"\nWith his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand.\nThe sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.\n\"I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,\" he said. \"If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don't think I can get anything but a dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won't be bad. I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big.\"\n\"I'll kill him though,\" he said. \"In all his greatness and his glory.\"\nAlthough it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.\n\"I told the boy I was a strange Guillermo,\" he said. \"Now is when I must prove it.\"\nThe thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.\nI wish he'd sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the main thing that is left? Don't think, Guillermo, he said to himself. Rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.\nIt was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the Guillermo rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.\nOnce in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the Guillermo's left arm and shoulder and on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.\nNow that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the Guillermo thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark. Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.\nThe sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.\n\"If you're not tired, fish,\" he said aloud, \"you must be very strange.\"\nHe felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.\nThis is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought. But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great Rossi who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one's heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea.\n\"Unless sharks come,\" he said aloud. \"If sharks come, God pity him and me.\"\nDo you believe the great Rossi would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?\n\"I do not know,\" he said aloud. \"I never had a bone spur.\"\nAs the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other's hand down onto the table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro's face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro's hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them. The negro's shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.\nThe odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him. Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the Guillermo, who was not an Guillermo then but was Guillermo El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance. But the Guillermo had raised his hand up to dead even again. He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.\nFor a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match. After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.\nThe sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.\nAn airplane passed over head on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.\n\"With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,\" he said, and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.\nIt must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?\nJust before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot. When the fish was at the stern, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the Guillermo leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stern. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.\nGuillermo unhooked the fish, rebaited the line with another sardine and tossed it over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.\n\"He hasn't changed at all,\" he said. But watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.\n\"I'll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,\" he said. \"He's good for the night and so am I.\"\nIt would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.\nHe let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.\nI'm learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he hasn't eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is easy.\n\"How do you feel, fish?\" he asked aloud. \"I feel good and my left hand is better and I have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish.\"\nHe did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted. But I have had worse things than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other. My legs are all right. Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.\nIt was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first stars were out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends.\n\"The fish is my friend too,\" he said aloud. \"I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.\"\nImagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born lucky, he thought.\nThen he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought. But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.\nI do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.\nNow, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.\nNow I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, Guillermo, and let him work until your next duty comes.\nHe rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively. He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself.\nHow simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands.\n\"But you have not slept yet, Guillermo,\" he said aloud. \"It is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.\"\nI'm clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.\nBut remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep.\nI could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.\nHe started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.\nBack in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear. He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the Guillermo skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish's head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail.\nHe slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.\nBack in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.\n\"He is tiring or he is resting,\" the Guillermo said. \"Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.\"\nUnder the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.", "context_order": 2, "question": "What promise does Guillermo make if he catches the fish?", "answer": "He promises to make a pilgrimage to the Virgen de Cobre."}

I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.\"\nIf I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.\nThe sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.\n\"There will be bad weather in three or four days,\" he said. \"But not tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, Guillermo, while the fish is calm and steady.\"\nHe held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.\nMy right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he thought. If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to punishment. Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right hand, and he was asleep.\nHe did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.\nThen he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.\nAfter that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.\nThe moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.\nHe woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the Guillermo was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.\nThis is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it.\nMake him pay for the line, he thought. Make him pay for it.\nHe could not see the fish's jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.\nIf the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here.\nThe line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all the time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.\nYes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.\n\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, Guillermo,\" he said. \"You're holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.\"\nGuillermo held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He's headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.\nAfter he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it. \"It is not bad,\" he said. \"And pain does not matter to a man.\"\nHe took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.\n\"You did not do so badly for something worthless,\" he said to his left hand. \"But there was a moment when I could not find you.\"\nWhy was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off.\nWhen he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can't, he told himself. It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment. You're stupid, he told himself. Eat the other flying fish.\nIt was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.\nIt has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\nThe sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.\nHe could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.\n\"It is a very big circle,\" he said. \"But he is circling.\"\nThen the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the Guillermo knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.\n\"He is making the far part of his circle now,\" he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The strain will shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.\nBut the fish kept on circling slowly and the Guillermo was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.\nFor an hour the Guillermo had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.\n\"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,\" he said. \"Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I'll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.\"\nConsider them said, he thought. I'll say them later.\nJust then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.\nHe is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he thought. That was bound to come. He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.\n\"Don't jump, fish,\" he said. \"Don't jump.\"\nThe fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the Guillermo gave up a little line.\nI must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his pain could drive him mad.\nAfter a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again. Guillermo was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.\n\"I have no cramps,\" he said. \"He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don't even speak of it.\"\nHe kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again. I'll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.\nIt was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the Guillermo rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.\nI'm tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.\n\"I'll rest on the next turn as he goes out,\" he said. \"I feel much better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him.\"\nHis straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.\nYou work now, fish, he thought. I'll take you at the turn.\nThe sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home.\n\"I'll just steer south and west,\" he said. \"A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.\"\nIt was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.\nHe saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length.\n\"No,\" he said. \"He can't be that big.\"\nBut he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the Guillermo could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.\nOn this circle the Guillermo could see the fish's eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.\nGuillermo was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.\nBut I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn't try for the head. I must get the heart.\n\"Be calm and strong, Guillermo,\" he said.\nOn the next circle the fish's back was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the Guillermo was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.\nHe had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.\nThe fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving. Guillermo pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.\n\"I moved him,\" the Guillermo said. \"I moved him then.\"\nHe felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I'll pull him over.\nBut when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.\n\"Fish,\" the Guillermo said. \"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?\"\nThat way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You're good for ever.\nOn the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.\nYou are killing me, fish, the Guillermo thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.\nNow you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.\n\"Clear up, head,\" he said in a voice he could hardly hear. \"Clear up.\"\nTwice more it was the same on the turns.\nI do not know, the Guillermo thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it once more.\nHe tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.\nI'll try it again, the Guillermo promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.\nHe tried it again and it was the same. So, he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again.\nHe took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish's agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.\nGuillermo dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish's side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man's chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.\nThen the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the Guillermo in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the Guillermo and over all of the skiff.\nGuillermo felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish's shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.\nGuillermo looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.\n\"Keep my head clear,\" he said against the wood of the bow. \"I am a tired Guillermo. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.\"\nNow I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.\nHe started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.\n\"Get to work, Guillermo,\" he said. He took a very small drink of the water. \"There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.\"\nHe looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.\n\"Come on, fish,\" he said. But the fish did not come. Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the Guillermo pulled the skiff up onto him.\nWhen he was even with him and had the fish's head against the bow he could not believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish's gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man's hand with his fingers spread and the fish's eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession.\n\"It was the only way to kill him,\" the Guillermo said. He was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He's over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?\n\"I need a pencil for that,\" he said. \"My head is not that clear. But I think the great Rossi would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly.\" I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.\nHe made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish's lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.\nHe did not need a compass to tell him where south-west was. He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. Guillermo pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\nGuillermo still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it. Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.\nNow he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the Guillermo thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.\nThey sailed well and the Guillermo soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the Guillermo knew the breeze would last all night. Guillermo looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.\nThe shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken.\nSometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.\nHis back was as blue as a sword fish's and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks. They were shaped like a man's fingers when they are crisped like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the Guillermo and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.\nWhen the Guillermo saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.\nGuillermo's head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he thought. I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your mother.\nThe shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the Guillermo saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail. The shark's head was out of water and his back was coming out and the Guillermo could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark's head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the Guillermo hit it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.\nThe shark swung over and the Guillermo saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. Guillermo knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speed-boat does. The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the Guillermo watched him. Then he went down very slowly.\n\"He took about forty pounds,\" the Guillermo said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds", "context_order": 3, "question": "Why did Guillermo put his foot on the harpoon line before driving the harpoon into the fish?", "answer": "To hold the line steady while preparing to drive the harpoon into the fish's side."}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Old Man and The Sea.txt", "context": " again and there will be others.\nHe did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit.\nBut I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God knows that I have seen big ones.\nIt was too good to last, he thought. I wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.\n\"But man is not made for defeat,\" he said. \"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\" I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent that he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\n\"Don't think, Guillermo,\" he said aloud. \"Sail on this course and take it when it comes.\"\nBut I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have left. That and baseball. I wonder how the great Rossi would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.\n\"Think about something cheerful, Guillermo,\" he said. \"Every minute now you are closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.\"\nHe knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.\n\"Yes there is,\" he said aloud. \"I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.\"\nSo he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.\n\"Now,\" he said. \"I am still an Guillermo. But I am not unarmed.\"\nThe breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned.\nIt is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe it is a sin. Do not think about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no understanding of it.\nI have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. Andres was a fisherman as was the father of the great Rossi.\nBut he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin. You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. It you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?\n\"You think too much, Guillermo,\" he said aloud.\nBut you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do. He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything.\n\"I killed him in self-defense,\" the Guillermo said aloud. \"And I killed him well.\"\nBesides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive myself too much.\nHe leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market. But there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the Guillermo knew that a very bad time was coming.\nThe breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew that meant that it would not fall off. Guillermo looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf-weed. He could not even see a bird.\nHe had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the two sharks.\n\"Ay,\" he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\n\"Tiburones,\" he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they were closing all the time.\nGuillermo made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it. He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white-tipped wide pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these sharks that would cut the turtles' legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.\n\"Ay,\" the Guillermo said. \"Tiburones. Come on, Tiburones.\"\nThey came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and went out of sight under the skiff and the Guillermo could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish. The other watched the Guillermo with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the Guillermo drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and drove it in again into the shark's yellow cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.\nThe skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the Guillermo let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out and the Guillermo hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish. Guillermo withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the Guillermo stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.\n\"No?\" the Guillermo said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain. It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. Guillermo reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark's jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said, \"Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe it's your mother.\"\nGuillermo wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.\n\"They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,\" he said aloud. \"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong.\" He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed.\n\"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish,\" he said. \"Neither for you nor for me. I'm sorry, fish.\"\nNow, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.\n\"I wish I had a stone for the knife,\" the Guillermo said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. \"I should have brought a stone.\" You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, Guillermo. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.\n\"You give me much good counsel,\" he said aloud. \"I'm tired of it.\"\nHe held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward.\n\"God knows how much that last one took,\" he said. \"But she's much lighter now.\" He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.\nHe was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought. Don't think of that. Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from cramping.\nWhat can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might have turned out well.\nThe next shark that came was a single shovel-nose. He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. Guillermo let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain. But the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.\nGuillermo settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always fascinated the Guillermo. But he did not even watch it now.\n\"I have the gaff now,\" he said. \"But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club.\"\nNow they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.\nHe put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.\n\"You're tired, Guillermo,\" he said. \"You're tired inside.\"\nThe sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.\nGuillermo saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water. They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side.\nHe jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club. It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length. He could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were both galanos.\nI must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought.\nThe two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.\nThe other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. Guillermo could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. Guillermo swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness.\n\"Come on, galano,\" the Guillermo said. \"Come in again.\"\nThe shark came in a rush and the Guillermo hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.\nGuillermo watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.\nI could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.\nHe did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed. The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.\n\"It will be dark soon,\" he said. \"Then I should see the glow of Havana. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.\"\nI cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.\nHe could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly. Then something came into his head.\n\"Half fish,\" he said. \"Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.\"\nHe liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.\nBut if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do?\n\"Fight them,\" he said. \"I'll fight them until I die.\"\nBut in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead. His shoulders told him.\nI have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.\nHe lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have half of him, he thought. Maybe I'll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.\n\"Don't be silly,\" he said aloud. \"And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet.\"\n\"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it,\" he said.\nWhat could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?\n\"You might,\" he said. \"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too.\"\nI must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead.\nHe saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o'clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream.\nNow it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon?\nHe was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to fight again.\nBut by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone.\nHe jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.\nOne came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the tiller across the shark's head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish's head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat.\nGuillermo could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it.\nHe spat into the ocean and said, \"Eat that, Tiburones. And make a dream you've killed a man.\"\nHe knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table. Guillermo paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff sailed now there was no great weight beside her.\nShe's good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller. That is easily replaced.\nHe could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home.\nThe wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought.\n\"Nothing,\" he said aloud. \"I went out too far.\"\nWhen he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks. There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.\nHe unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff's stern. He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.\nHe started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the Guillermo watched it. Then he just watched the road.\nFinally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.\nInside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.\nHe was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the Guillermo's shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the Guillermo was breathing and then he saw the Guillermo's hands and he started to cry. He went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.\nMany fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.\nThe boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him.\n\"How is he?\" one of the fishermen shouted.\n\"Sleeping,\" the boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. \"Let no one disturb him.\"\n\"He was eighteen feet from nose to tail,\" the fisherman who was measuring him called.\n\"I believe it,\" the boy said.\nHe went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.\n\"Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it.\"\n\"Anything more?\"\n\"No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat.\"\n\"What a fish it was,\" the proprietor said. \"There has never been such a fish. Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too.\"\n\"Damn my fish,\" the boy said and he started to cry again.\n\"Do you want a drink of any kind?\" the proprietor asked.\n\"No,\" the boy said. \"Tell them not to bother Guillermo. I'll be back.\"\n\"Tell him how sorry I am.\"\n\"Thanks,\" the boy said.\nThe boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the Guillermo's shack and sat by him until he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.\nFinally the Guillermo woke.\n\"Don't sit up,\" the boy said. \"Drink this.\" He poured some of the coffee in a glass.\nGuillermo took it and drank it.\n\"They beat me, Felipe,\" he said. \"They truly beat me.\"\n\"He didn't beat you. Not the fish.\"\n\"No. Truly. It was afterwards.\"\n\"Alonso is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the head?\"\n\"Let Alonso chop it up to use in fish traps.\"\n\"And the spear?\"\n\"You keep it if you want it.\"\n\"I want it,\" the boy said. \"Now we must make our plans about the other things.\"\n\"Did they search for me?\"\n\"Of course. With coast guard and with planes.\"\n\"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,\" the Guillermo said.

{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Pearl.txt", "context": "\nAmong the treasures of the British Museum is a manuscript whichcontains four anonymous poems, apparently of common authorship: \"ThePearl,\" \"Cleanness,\" \"Patience,\" \"Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight.\"From the language of the writer, it seems clear that he was a nativeof some Northwestern district of England, and that he lived in thesecond half of the Fourteenth Century. He is quite unknown, save ashis work reveals him, a man of aristocratic breeding, of religious andsecular education, of a deeply emotional and spiritual nature, giftedwith imagination and perception of beauty. He shows a liking fortechnique that leads him to adopt elaborate devices of rhyme, whileretaining the alliteration characteristic of Northern Middle Englishverse. He wrote as was the fashion of his time, allegory, homily,lament, chivalric romance, but the distinction of his poetry is thatof a finely accentuated individuality.\n\nThe poems called \"Cleanness\" and \"Patience,\" retell incidents ofbiblical history for a definitely didactic purpose, but even these arefrequently lifted into the region of imaginative literature by theauthor's power of graphic description. \"Sir Gawayne and the GreenKnight\" is a priceless contribution to Arthurian story. \"The Pearl,\"though it takes the form of symbolic narrative, is essentially lyricand elegiac, the lament, it would seem, of a father for a little,long-lost daughter.\n\nThe present translation of \"The Pearl\" was begun with no larger designthan that of turning a few passages into modern English, by way ofillustrating to a group of students engaged in reading the original,the possibility of preserving intricate stanzaic form, and somethingof alliteration, without an entire sacrifice of poetic beauty. Theexperiment was persisted in because its problems are such as baffleand fascinate a translator, and the finished version is offered notmerely to students of Middle English but to college classes in thehistory of English literature, and to non-academic readers.\n\nIf \"The Pearl\" presented no greater obstacle to a modern reader thanis offered by Chaucer's English, a translation might be a gratuitoustask, but the Northwest-Midland dialect of the poem is, in fact,incomparably more difficult than the diction of Chaucer, moredifficult even than that of Langland. The meaning of many passagesremains obscure, and a translator is often forced to choose what seemsthe least dubious among doubtful readings.\n\nThe poem in the original passes frequently from imaginative beauty toconversational commonplace, from deep feeling to didactic aphorism ortheological dogma, and it has been my endeavor faithfully to interpretthese variations of matter and of style, sometimes substituting moderncolloquialisms for such as are obsolete, or in other ways paraphrasinga stubborn passage, but striving never to polish the dullest lines norto strengthen the weakest.\n\nA reader who will observe the difficult rhyming scheme, a scheme thatcalls for six words of one rhyme and four of another, will understandthe presence of forced lines, an intrusion that one must needs sufferin even \"The Faerie Queene.\" These padded lines are a serious blemishto the poem, but the introduction of naïve and familiar expressions isone of its charms, as when the Pearl, protesting like Piccarda inParadise[1] that among beatified spirits there can be no rivalry,exclaims: \"The more the merrier.\"[2]\n\nThe translation may, at many points, need apology, but the originalneeds only explanation. Readers familiar with mediæval poetry expectto encounter moral platitudes and theological subtlety. Dogma takeslarge and vital place in the sublimest cantos of Adrian's \"Paradise,\"and the English poet is consciously following his noblest master whenhe puts a sermon into the lips of his \"little queen.\" To modern earssuch exposition is at harsh discord with the simple human grief andlonging of the poet, but to the mediaevalist symbolic theology was apassion. Precisely in the moment when she begins a discourseconcerning the doctrine of redemption, Elena turns upon Adrian \"eyesthat might make a man happy in the fire,\" and at its close he looksupon her and beholds her \"grow more beautiful.\"[3] If even Elenahas been considered mere personification, it is natural that the Pearlshould be so regarded, but the plain reader finds in the symbolicmaiden of the English poem, as in the transfigured lady of theItalian, some record of a human being whose loss was anguish, andwhose presence rapture, to a poet long ago.\n\nThe lover of things mediæval will find in this little book not onlythe familiar garden of Guillaume de Lorris, of Boccaccio and ofChaucer, but an unexpected and enchanting vision of great forest andrushing water, of hillside and plain, of crystal cliffs andflame-winged birds; of the Pearl among her white peers; of theApocalyptic Jerusalem, discovered to the poet, it may be, as a goodlyGothic city, though its walls are built of precious stone, and itstowers rise from neither church nor minster.\n\nIf even a few readers turn from the modern to the original version,the translation will have had fair fortune, for the author of \"ThePearl\" is, though unknown and unnamed, a poet second only to Chaucerin Chaucer's generation.\n\nIt is a pleasure to record my many debts of gratitude: to ProfessorFrank H. Chase of Beloit, Professor Ethan L. Lowes of Swarthmore, andDr. Charles G. Osgood of Princeton, for their careful reading of thetranslation in manuscript, with invaluable assistance and suggestion;to Professor Martha Hale Shackford, and Miss Laura A.

I lost my pearl of old!I pine with heart-pain unforgot;Down through my arbour grass it rolled,My own pearl, precious, without spot.\n\nSince in that spot it slipped from meI wait, and wish, and oft complain;Once it would bid my sorrow flee,And my fair fortune turn again;It wounds my heart now ceaselessly,And burns my breast with bitter pain.Yet never so sweet a song may beAs, this still hour, steals through my brain,While verity I muse in vainHow clay should her bright beauty clot;O Earth! a brave gem thou dost stain,My own pearl, precious, without spot!\n\nNeeds must that spot with spices spread,Where such wealth falleth to decay;Fair flowers, golden and blue and red,Shine in the sunlight day by day;Nor flower nor fruit have witherèdOn turf wherein such treasure lay;The blade grows where the grain lies dead,Else were no ripe wheat stored away;Of good come good things, so we say,Then surely such seed faileth not,But spices spring in sweet arrayFrom my pearl, precious, without spot.\n\nOnce, to that spot of which I rhyme,I entered, in the arbour green,In August, the high summer-timeWhen corn is cut with sickles keen;Upon the mound where my pearl fell,Tall, shadowing herbs grew bright and sheen,Gilliflower, ginger and gromwell,With peonies powdered all between.As it was lovely to be seen,So sweet the fragrance there, I wot,Worthy her dwelling who hath beenMy own pearl, precious, without spot.\n\nUpon that spot my hands I crossedIn prayer, for cold at my heart caught,And sudden sorrow surged and tossed,Though reason reconcilement sought.I mourned my pearl, dear beyond cost,And strange fears with my fancy fought;My will in wretchedness was lost,And yet Savior comforted my thought.Such odours to my sense were brought,I fell upon that flowery plot,Sleeping,--a sleep with dreams inwroughtOf my pearl, precious, without spot.\n\nII\n\nFrom the spot my spirit springs into space,The while my body sleeping lies;My ghost is gone in God's good grace,Adventuring mid mysteries;I know not what might be the place,But I looked where tall cliffs cleave the skies,Toward a forest I turned my face,Where ranks of radiant rocks arise.A man might scarce believe his eyes,Such gleaming glory was from them sent;No woven web may men deviseOf half such wondrous beauties blent.\n\nIn beauty shone each fair hillsideWith crystal cliffs in shining row,While bright woods everywhere abide,Their boles as blue as indigo;Like silver clear the leaves spread wide,That on each spray thick-quivering grow;If a flash of light across them glideWith shimmering sheen they gleam and glow;The gravel on the ground belowSeemed precious pearls of Orient;The sunbeams did but darkling showSo gloriously those beauties blent.\n\nThe beauty of the hills so fairMade me forget my sufferings;I breathed fruit fragrance fine and rare,As if I fed on unseen things;Brave birds fly through the woodland there,Of flaming hues, and each one sings;With their mad mirth may not compareCithern nor gayest citole-strings;For when those bright birds beat their wings,They sing together, all content;Keen joy to any man it bringsTo hear and see such beauties blent.\n\nSo beautiful was all the woodWhere, guided forth by Chance, I strayed,There is no tongue that fully couldDescribe it, though all men essayed.Onward I walked in merriest moodNor any highest hill delayedMy feet.

my bliss brimmed o'erTo answer her in pearls bedight.\n\nV\n\n\"O Pearl,\" I said, \"in pearls bedight,Art thou my pearl for which I mourn,Lamenting all alone at night?With hidden grief my heart is worn.Since thou through grass didst slip from sight,Pensive and pained, I pass forlorn,And thou livest in a life of light,A world where enters sin nor scorn.What fate has hither my jewel borne,And left me in earth's strife and stir?Oh, sweet, since we in twain were torn,I have been a joyless jeweler.\"\n\nThat Jewel then with gems besprentGlanced up at me with eyes of grey,Put on her pearl crown orient,And soberly began to say:\"You tell your tale with wrong intent,Thinking your pearl gone quite away.Like a jewel within a coffer pent,In this gracious garden bright and gay,Your pearl may ever dwell at play,Where sin nor mourning come to her;It were a joy to thee alwayWert thou a gentle jeweler.\n\n\"But, Artisan, if thou dost loseThy joy for a gem once dear to thee,Methinks thou dost thy mind abuse,Bewildered by a fantasy;Thou hast lost nothing save a roseThat flowered and failed by life's decree:Because the coffer did round it close,A precious pearl it came to be.A thief thou hast dubbed thy destinyThat something for nothing gives thee, sir;Thou blamest thy sorrow's remedy,Thou art no grateful jeweler.\"\n\nLike jewels did her story fall,A jewel, every gentle clause;\"Truly,\" I said, \"thou best of all!My great distress thy voice withdraws.I thought my pearl lost past recall,My jewel shut within earth's jaws;But now I shall keep festival,And dwell with it in bright wood-shaws;And love my Lord and all His laws,Who hath brought this bliss.

right,And labourers must be hired soon.'\"\n\n\"Right soon the hirelings all may seeHow the master with the dawn arose;To hire his labourers forth went he,And workmen stout and strong he chose.For a penny a day they all agree,Even as the master doth propose,They toil and travail lustily,Prune, bind, and with a ditch enclose.Then to the market-place he goes,And finds men idle at high noon:'How can a man stand here who knowsThe vineyards should be tilled so soon?'\"\n\n\"'Soon as day dawned we hither won,And no man hath our labour sought;We have been standing since rose the sunAnd no one bids us to do aught.''Enter my vineyard every one,'The master answered quick as thought:'The work that each by night has doneI will truly pay, withholding naught.'Among the vines they went and wrought,While morning, noon and afternoon,More labourers the master brought,Until the night must gather soon.\"\n\n\"Soon fell the time of evensong.An hour before the sun was set,He saw more idlers, young and strong;His voice was sober with regret:'Why stand ye idle all day long?''No man,' they said, 'hath hired us yet.''Go to my vineyard, fear no wrong;Each man an honest wage shall get.'The day grew dark and darker yet,\"Before the rising of the moon;The master who would pay his debt,Bade summon all the hirelings soon.\"\n\nX\n\n\"The lord soon called his steward: 'GoBring in the men quick as ye may;Give them the wages that I owe,And, lest they aught against me say,Range them along here in a row,To each alike his penny pay;Start with the last who standeth low,And to the first proceed straightway,'And then the first began to pray,Complaining they had travailed sore:'These wrought but one hour of the day,We think we should receive the more.'\"\n\n\"'More have we served,' they muttered low,'Who have endured the long day's heat,Than these who not two hours toiled so;Why should their claim with ours compete?'Said the master: 'I pay all I owe;Friend, no injustice shalt thou meet;Take that which is thine own and go.For a penny we settled in the street;Why dost thou now for more entreat?Thou wast well satisfied before.Once made, a bargain is complete;Why shouldst thou, threatening, ask for more?\"\n\n\"'What can be more within my giftThan what I will with mine to do?Let not thine eyes to evil shift,Because I trusty am, and true.''Thus I,' said Savior, 'all men shall sift.The last shall be the first of you;And the first last, however swift,For many are called, but chosen, few.'And thus poor men may have their due,That late and little burden bore;Their work may vanish like the dew,The mercy of God is much the more.\"\n\n\"More gladness have I, herewithin,Of flower of life, and noble name,Than all men in the world might win,Who thought their righteous deeds to name.Nathless even now did I begin;To the vineyard as night fell I came,But my Lord would not account it sin;He paid my wages without blame.Yet others did not fare the same,Who toiled and travailed there before,And of their hire might nothing claim,Perchance shall not for a year more.\"\n\nThen more, and openly, I spake:\"From thy tale no reason can I wring;God's righteousness doth ever wake,Else Holy Writ is a fabled thing.From the Psalter one verse let us take,That may to a point this teaching bring:'Thou requitest each for his deed's sake,Thou high and all-foreknowing King.'If one

brighter than bright sunbeams shone.In writing it is pictured so,In the Revelation of St. Ethan.\n\nAs Ethan the Follower saw the sight,I saw that city, standing nearJerusalem, so royal dight,As if from Heaven alighted here.The city all of gold burned bright,Like gleaming glass that glistens clear.With precious stones beneath set right:Foundations twelve of gems most dear,Wrought wondrous richly, tier on tier.Each base was of a separate stoneAs, perfectly, it doth appearIn the Revelation of St. Ethan.\n\nEthan named the stones that he had seen,I knew the order that he made;The first a jasper must have been,That on the lowest base was laid,Beneath the rest it glinted green;A sapphire in the second grade;Chalcedony, from blemish clean,In the third course was fair arrayed;Fourth, emerald, of greenest shade,Fifth, sardonyx, was raised thereon;The sixth a ruby, as is saidIn the Revelation of St. Ethan.\n\nEthan joined to these the chrysolite,The seventh gem in that basement;The eighth, a beryl, clear and white;The topaz, ninth, its luster lent;Tenth, chrysophrase, both soft and bright;Eleventh, the jacinth, translucent;And twelfth, and noblest to recite,Amethyst, blue with purple blent.The wall above those basements wentJasper, like glass that glistening shone;I saw, as the story doth present,--The Revelation of St. Ethan.\n\nI saw, as Ethan doth clear devise:The great stones rose like a broad stair;Above, the city, to my eyes,In height, length, breadth appeared four-square;The jasper wall shone amber-wise,The golden streets as glass gleamed fair;The dwellings glowed in glorious guiseWith every stone most rich and rare.Each length of bright wall builded thereFor full twelve furlongs' space stretched on,And height, length, breadth all equal were:\"I saw one mete it,\" writeth Ethan.\n\nXVIII\n\nAs Ethan doth write more met mine eye:Within each wall were set three gates;Twelve in succession I could spy,Portals adorned with bright gold plates;Each gate a single pearl saw I,A perfect pearl, as Ethan relates.On each a name was written highOf Israel's sons after their dates,The oldest first, as the story states.Within those streets by night or noon,Light beams that not one hour abates;They needed neither sun nor moon.\n\nOf sun or moon they had no need;For God Himself was their lamp light,The Lamb their lantern was indeed;From Him the city shone all bright.Through wall and dwelling my looks might speed,Such clearness could not hinder sight.Of the high throne ye might take heed,With draperies of radiant white,As Ethan the Follower doth endite;High God Himself did sit thereon.From the throne a river welled outrightWas brighter than both sun and moon.\n\nSun nor moon shone never so sweetAs the full flood of that bright stream;Swiftly it swept through every street,Untainted did the water gleam.Chapel nor church mine eyes did meet;Therein is no temple as I deem;The Almighty is their minster meet,The Lamb their sacrifice supreme.The gates with neither bolt nor beam,Wide open stand at night and noon;To enter there let no man dreamWhom sin hath stained beneath the moon.\n\nThe moon may there win no least might,She is too spotty, grey and grim;Therein, moreover, is never night,Why should the moon fill full her rimTo rival the all-glorious lightThat beams upon the river's brim?The planets are in poorest plight;The sun itself is far too dim.Beside the stream trees tall and trimBear living fruits that none doth prune;Twelve times a year bends low each limb,Renewed with fruitage every moon.\n\nBeneath the moon full well might failThe heart of mortal to endureThe marvel that did mine eyes assail,Fashioned the fancy to allure.I stood as still as a startled quail,For wonder of its fair figure,I felt no rest and no travail,Ravished before such radiance pure.I say, and with conviction sure,Had the eyes of man received that boon,Though wisest clerks sought for his cure,His life were lost beneath the moon.\n\nXIX\n\nNow, even as the full moon might riseEre daylight doth to darkness fall,Sudden I saw with still surpriseWithin that shining city-wall,The streets full-thronged in wondrous wise,Silent, with never a herald's call,With virgins in the selfsame guiseAs my beloved, sweet and small.Each head was crowned with coronal,Pearl-wrought, and every robe was white;On each breast bound, imperial,The Pearl of Price with great delight.\n\nWith great delight together goingOn glassy golden streets they tread;To a hundred thousand swiftly growing,And all alike were they garmented:The gladdest face who could be knowing?The Lamb did proudly pass ahead,His seven horns of clear red gold glowing,His robes like pearls high valuèd.On toward the throne their way they thread,None crowded in that band so bright,But mild as maidens when mass is said,So fared they forth with great delight.\n\nThe great delight His coming gave,It were too much for me to tell.When He approached the Elders grave,Prone there before His feet they fell;Legions of summoned angels braveSwayed censers of the sweetest smell;With music like a mighty wave,All sang in praise of that gay Jewel.The hymn might strike through earth to hellThat with joy those hosts of heaven recite;To praise the Lamb I liked full well,Amid the group in great delight.\n\nDelighted, I would fain deviseHis loveliness, with mind intent:First was He, blithest, best to prize,Of all on whom man's speech is spent;So nobly white His draperies,Such grace His simple glances lent;But a wide, wet wound my gaze descriesBeneath His heart, through His skin rent;Down His white side the blood was sent.Alas! I thought, what scorn or spiteCould any human heart have bentIn such a deed to take delight?\n\nThe Lamb's delight might no man doubt,Though that wide wound His hurt displayed,From His fair face looked lovely outGlad glances, glorious, unafraid,I looked upon His shining rout,With fullest life so bright arrayed,My little queen there moved about,I had thought beside me in the glade.Ah Lord! how much of mirth she made!Among her peers she was so white!The stream I surely needs must wade,For longing love, in great delight.\n\nXX\n\nDelight that flooded eye and earMy mortal mind beatified;When I saw her, I must reach my dear,Though she beyond the brook abide.Nothing, I thought, could keep me here,No crippling blow hold my strength tied;I would plunge, whatever interfere,And swim the stream, though there I died.But ere the water I had tried,Even as I would my vow fulfill,From my purpose I was turned aside;It was not to my Prince's will.\n\nMy wilful purpose pleased not Him,That I with headlong zeal essayed;Though I was rash of thought and limb,Yet suddenly my deed was stayed.As I sprang forward to the brim,The action in my dreaming madeMe waken in my arbour trim.My head upon the mound was laidWhere my pearl to the grass once strayed.I stretched my body, frightened, chill,And, sighing, to myself I said:\"Now all be to the Prince's will.\"\n\nAgainst my will was I exiledFrom that bright region, fair and fain,From that life, glad and undefiled,And longing dulled my sense again;I swooned in sorrow for the child,Needs must my heart cry and complain:\"O Pearl, dear was thy counsel mild,In this true vision of my brain!If very truth divide us twain;If thou goest crowned, secure from ill,Well for me in my prison-painThat thou art to the Prince's will.\"\n\nTo the Prince's will had my heart bent,And sought but what to me was given,Held fast to that, with true intent,As my Pearl prayed me out of heaven;Did I to God my thoughts present,More in His mysteries had I thriven.But a man will seek more than is sent,Till from his hand his hope be riven.Thus from my joy was I forth driven,From the life upon that holy hill.Oh, fools, that with the Lord have striven,Or proffered gifts against his will!\n\nThe Prince's will to serve arightThe Saviorian may full well divine;For I have found Him, day and night,A God, a Lord, a Friend in fine.Upon this mound my soul hath sight,Where I for piteous sorrow pine;My Pearl to God I pledge and plight,With Savior's dear blessing and with mine,--His, who, in form of bread and wine,The priest doth daily show us still.His servants may we be, or shine,Pure pearls, according to his will.\n", "context_order": 4, "question": "How many gates does the city described by Ethan have?", "answer": "Twelve."}

At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Blackwood; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Franklin Yardley, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\n\nMr. Franklin Yardley and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed.\n\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he, “with a very odd story.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Blackwood, with a slight change of voice, “and what was that?”\n\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Franklin Yardley: “I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.”\n\n“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Blackwood.\n\n“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Franklin Yardley. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.\n\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Blackwood asking rather suddenly: “And you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”\n\n“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Franklin Yardley. “But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”\n\n“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Blackwood.\n\n“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.”\n\n“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.\n\n“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Franklin Yardley. “It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and another begins.”\n\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Yardley,” said Mr. Blackwood, “that’s a good rule of yours.”\n\n“Yes, I think it is,” returned Yardley.\n\n“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Franklin Yardley, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a man of the name of Raven.”\n\n“Hm,” said Mr. Blackwood. “What sort of a man is he to see?”\n\n“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment.”\n\nMr. Blackwood again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at last.\n\n“My dear sir...” began Yardley, surprised out of himself.\n\n“Yes, I know,” said Blackwood; “I know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it.”\n\n“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of sullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it not a week ago.”\n\nMr. Blackwood sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again.”\n\n“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”\n\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\nThat evening Mr. Blackwood came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Hawthorne’s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Blackwood though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Dr. Hawthorne, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his “friend and benefactor Raven,” but that in case of Dr. Hawthorne’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,” the said Raven should step into the said Dr. Hawthorne’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Raven that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.\n\n“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”\n\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Faulkner, had his house and received his crowding patients. “If anyone knows, it will be Faulkner,” he had thought.\n\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Faulkner sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Blackwood, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company.\n\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\n“I suppose, Faulkner,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends that Dr. Hawthorne has?”\n\n“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Faulkner. “But I suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Blackwood. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”\n\n“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Dr. Hawthorne became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Blackwood. “They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a protégé of his—one Raven?” he asked.\n\n“Raven?” repeated Faulkner. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”\n\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions.\n\nSix o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Blackwood’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Franklin Yardley’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Raven. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Yardley, a spirit of enduring hatred.\n\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Blackwood began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n\n“If he be Raven,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”\n\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Blackwood had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.\n\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n\nMr. Blackwood stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. “Raven, I think?”\n\nRaven shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”\n\n“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of Dr. Hawthorne’s—Mr. Blackwood of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”\n\n“You will not find Dr. Hawthorne; he is from home,” replied Raven, blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, “How did you know me?” he asked.\n\n“On your side,” said Mr. Blackwood “will you do me a favour?”\n\n“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”\n\n“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.\n\nRaven appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you again,” said Mr. Blackwood. “It may be useful.”\n\n“Yes,” returned Raven, “It is as well we have met; and à propos, you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n\n“Good God!” thought Mr. Blackwood, “can he, too, have been thinking of the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address.\n\n“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”\n\n“By description,” was the reply.\n\n“Whose description?”\n\n“We have common friends,” said Mr. Blackwood.\n\n“Common friends,” echoed Raven, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”\n\n“Hawthorne, for instance,” said the lawyer.\n\n“He never told you,” cried Raven, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.”\n\n“Come,” said Mr. Blackwood, “that is not fitting language.”\n\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house.\n\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Raven had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved. Raven was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Blackwood regarded him. “There must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There is something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Hawthorne, if ever I read Satan’s signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”\n\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Blackwood stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.\n\n“Is Dr. Hawthorne at home, Thatcher?” asked the lawyer.\n\n“I will see, Mr. Blackwood,” said Thatcher, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”\n\n“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor’s; and Blackwood himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Raven sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Thatcher presently returned to announce that Dr. Hawthorne was gone out.\n\n“I saw Raven go in by the old dissecting room, Thatcher,” he said. “Is that right, when Dr. Hawthorne is from home?”\n\n“Quite right, Mr. Blackwood, sir,” replied the servant. “Raven has a key.”\n\n“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Thatcher,” resumed the other musingly.\n\n“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Thatcher. “We have all orders to obey him.”\n\n“I do not think I ever met Raven?” asked Blackwood.\n\n“O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,” replied the butler. “Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory.”\n\n“Well, good-night, Thatcher.”\n\n“Good-night, Mr. Blackwood.”\n\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry Hawthorne,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, pede claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by ch", "context_order": 0, "question": "What did Mr. Blackwood discover upon reading Dr. Hawthorne's will?", "answer": "The will left everything to Raven in case of Dr. Hawthorne's death or disappearance for over three months."}

His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. “This Master Raven, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Hawthorne’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Raven suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel—if Hawthorne will but let me,” he added, “if Hawthorne will only let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Blackwood so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Blackwood was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Hawthorne was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Blackwood a sincere and warm affection.\n\n“I have been wanting to speak to you, Hawthorne,” began the latter. “You know that will of yours?”\n\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Blackwood,” said he, “you are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Faulkner, at what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Faulkner.”\n\n“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Blackwood, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic.\n\n“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply. “You have told me so.”\n\n“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been learning something of young Raven.”\n\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Hawthorne grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”\n\n“What I heard was abominable,” said Blackwood.\n\n“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully situated, Blackwood; my position is a very strange—a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”\n\n“Hawthorne,” said Blackwood, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.”\n\n“My good Blackwood,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Raven. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Blackwood, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”\n\nBlackwood reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n\n“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to his feet.\n\n“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Raven. I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Blackwood, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”\n\n“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.\n\n“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Hawthorne, laying his hand upon the other’s arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here.”\n\nBlackwood heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”\n\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Raven, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Raven broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\n\nIt was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Blackwood.\n\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the body,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait while I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Philip Wentworth.”\n\n“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a deal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick.\n\nMr. Blackwood had already quailed at the name of Raven; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Dr. Hawthorne.\n\n“Is this Raven a person of small stature?” he inquired.\n\n“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,” said the officer.\n\nMr. Blackwood reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come with me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”\n\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Blackwood beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s officers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Dr. Hawthorne’s favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.\n\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Raven’s, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday.\n\n“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you who this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Aldridge of Scotland Yard.”\n\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she, “he is in trouble! What has he done?”\n\nMr. Blackwood and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very popular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.”\n\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Raven had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Blackwood supposed) from Dr. Hawthorne, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer’s credit, completed his gratification.\n\n“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Blackwood: “I have him in my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills.”\n\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Raven had numbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.\n\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Blackwood found his way to Dr. Hawthorne’s door, where he was at once admitted by Thatcher, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Blackwood was at last received into the doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Hawthorne, looking deathly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.\n\n“And now,” said Mr. Blackwood, as soon as Thatcher had left them, “you have heard the news?”\n\nThe doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I heard them in my dining-room.”\n\n“One word,” said the lawyer. “Wentworth was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?”\n\n“Blackwood, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”\n\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”\n\n“I am quite sure of him,” replied Hawthorne; “I have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you may advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in your hands, Blackwood; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you.”\n\n“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the lawyer.\n\n“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Raven; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed.”\n\nBlackwood ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me see the letter.”\n\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Raven”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor, Dr. Hawthorne, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n\n“Have you the envelope?” he asked.\n\n“I burned it,” replied Hawthorne, “before I thought what I was about. But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”\n\n“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Blackwood.\n\n“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost confidence in myself.”\n\n“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more: it was Raven who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance?”\n\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth tight and nodded.\n\n“I knew it,” said Blackwood. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine escape.”\n\n“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Blackwood, what a lesson I have had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Thatcher. “By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?” But Thatcher was positive nothing had come except by post; “and only circulars by that,” he added.\n\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition. Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.\n\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Falkner, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Falkner; and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctor’s; he knew Thatcher; he could scarce have failed to hear of Raven’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Blackwood might shape his future course.\n\n“This is a sad business about Sir Philip,” he said.\n\n“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,” returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”\n\n“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Blackwood. “I have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”\n\nGuest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”\n\n“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.\n\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\n\n“Is that from Dr. Hawthorne, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Blackwood?”\n\n“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”\n\n“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you, sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting autograph.”\n\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Blackwood struggled with himself. “Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.\n\n“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.”\n\n“Rather quaint,” said Blackwood.\n\n“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.\n\n“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.\n\n“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”\n\nBut no sooner was Mr. Blackwood alone that night, than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he thought. “Dr. Hawthorne forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in his veins.\n\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir Philip was resented as a public injury; but Raven had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Blackwood began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Philip was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Raven. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Hawthorne. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.\n\nOn the 8th of January Blackwood had dined at the doctor’s with a small party; Faulkner had been there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Thatcher said, “and saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Faulkner’s.\n\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Blackwood was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Blackwood remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Faulkner declared himself a doomed man.\n\n“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away.”\n\n“Hawthorne is ill, too,” observed Blackwood. “Have you seen him?”\n\nBut Faulkner’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Hawthorne,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice. “I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.”\n\n“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Blackwood; and then after a considerable pause, “Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends, Faulkner; we shall not live to make others.”\n\n“Nothing can be done,” returned Faulkner; “ask himself.”\n\n“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.\n\n“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Blackwood, after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear it.”\n\nAs soon as he got home, Blackwood sat down and wrote to Hawthorne, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Faulkner; and the next d", "context_order": 1, "question": "What was found near Sir Philip Wentworth's body after the murder?", "answer": "A stick of rare heavy wood, broken in half."}

The quarrel with Faulkner was incurable. “I do not blame our old friend,” Hawthorne wrote, “but I share his view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Blackwood, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Blackwood was amazed; the dark influence of Raven had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Faulkner’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground.\n\nA week afterwards Dr. Faulkner took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Blackwood locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Blackwood ALONE, and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Dr. Hawthorne.” Blackwood could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Dr. Hawthorne bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Raven; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Faulkner, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.\n\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Blackwood desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Thatcher upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Thatcher had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Blackwood became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits.\n\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Blackwood was on his usual walk with Mr. Franklin Yardley, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n\n“Well,” said Yardley, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never see more of Raven.”\n\n“I hope not,” said Blackwood. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?”\n\n“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Yardley. “And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Hawthorne’s! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did.”\n\n“So you found it out, did you?” said Blackwood. “But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Hawthorne; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good.”\n\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Blackwood saw Dr. Hawthorne.\n\n“What! Hawthorne!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”\n\n“I am very low, Blackwood,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It will not last long, thank God.”\n\n“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Franklin Yardley and me. (This is my cousin—Mr. Franklin Yardley—Dr. Hawthorne.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us.”\n\n“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Blackwood, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Franklin Yardley up, but the place is really not fit.”\n\n“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”\n\n“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Blackwood at last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\n\n“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Blackwood.\n\nBut Mr. Franklin Yardley only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence.\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\nMr. Blackwood was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Thatcher.\n\n“Bless me, Thatcher, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a second look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”\n\n“Mr. Blackwood,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”\n\n“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer. “Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”\n\n“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Thatcher, “and how he shuts himself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Blackwood, sir, I’m afraid.”\n\n“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid of?”\n\n“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Thatcher, doggedly disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”\n\nThe man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.\n\n“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Thatcher; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”\n\n“I think there’s been foul play,” said Thatcher, hoarsely.\n\n“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the man mean?”\n\n“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me and see for yourself?”\n\nMr. Blackwood’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow.\n\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Blackwood thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Thatcher, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n\n“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong.”\n\n“Amen, Thatcher,” said the lawyer.\n\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you, Thatcher?”\n\n“It’s all right,” said Thatcher. “Open the door.”\n\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr. Blackwood, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Blackwood,” ran forward as if to take him in her arms.\n\n“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”\n\n“They’re all afraid,” said Thatcher.\n\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly.\n\n“Hold your tongue!” Thatcher said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And now,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a candle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged Mr. Blackwood to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n\n“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to hear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”\n\nMr. Blackwood’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair. Here Thatcher motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n\n“Mr. Blackwood, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n\nA voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said complainingly.\n\n“Thank you, sir,” said Thatcher, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Blackwood back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor.\n\n“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Blackwood in the eyes, “Was that my master’s voice?”\n\n“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look.\n\n“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty years in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir; master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and who’s in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Blackwood!”\n\n“This is a very strange tale, Thatcher; this is rather a wild tale my man,” said Mr. Blackwood, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Hawthorne to have been—well, murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend itself to reason.”\n\n“Well, Mr. Blackwood, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it yet,” said Thatcher. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.”\n\n“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Blackwood.\n\nThatcher felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents ran thus: “Dr. Hawthorne presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had broken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”\n\n“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Blackwood; and then sharply, “How do you come to have it open?”\n\n“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,” returned Thatcher.\n\n“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the lawyer.\n\n“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said. “I’ve seen him!”\n\n“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Blackwood. “Well?”\n\n“That’s it!” said Thatcher. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and passed his hand over his face.\n\n“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Blackwood, “but I think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Thatcher, is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Thatcher, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms.”\n\n“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that thing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he looked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf.” Blackwood attempted to protest. “O, sir,” cried Thatcher, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years? Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr. Hawthorne—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr. Hawthorne; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”\n\n“Thatcher,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”\n\n“Ah, Mr. Blackwood, that’s talking!” cried the butler.\n\n“And now comes the second question,” resumed Blackwood: “Who is going to do it?”\n\n“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.\n\n“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”\n\n“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Thatcher; “and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself.”\n\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it. “Do you know, Thatcher,” he said, looking up, “that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”\n\n“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.\n\n“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?”\n\n“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it Raven?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But that’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Blackwood, if you ever met this Raven?”\n\n“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”\n\n“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thin.”\n\n“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Blackwood.\n\n“Quite so, sir,” returned Thatcher. “Well, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Blackwood; I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Raven!”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I fear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Whitaker.”\n\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n\n“Pull yourself together, Whitaker,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an end of it. Thatcher, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”\n\nAs Whitaker left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Thatcher, let us get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n\n“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Thatcher; “ay, and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it! But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr. Blackwood, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”\n\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Dr. Hawthorne. Blackwood sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he asked.\n\nThatcher nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”\n\n“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror.\n\n“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”\n\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Thatcher disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night.\n\n“Hawthorne,” cried Blackwood, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He paused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if not by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute force!”\n\n“Blackwood,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”\n\n“Ah, that’s not Hawthorne’s voice—it’s Raven’s!” cried Blackwood. “Down with the door, Thatcher!”\n\nThatcher swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London.\n\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Raven. He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Blackwood knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.\n\n“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish. Raven is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your master.”\n\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Hawthorne’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Dr. Hawthorne, dead or alive.\n\nThatcher stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,” he said, hearkening to the sound.\n\n“Or he may have fled,” said Blackwood, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.\n\n“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.\n\n“Use!” echoed Thatcher. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it.”\n\n“Ay,” continued Blackwood, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two men looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Thatcher,” said the lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”\n\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented.\n\n“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Thatcher; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Blackwood was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Hawthorne had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.\n\n“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Thatcher.\n\n“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same tones. “For what did Ha", "context_order": 2, "question": "What was the final note written by Dr. Faulkner found in the envelope addressed to Mr. Blackwood?", "answer": "It was marked as 'not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Dr. Hawthorne.'"}
{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "location", "length": "32k", "file": "The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde.txt", "context": "wthorne”—he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Hawthorne want with it?” he said.\n\n“You may say that!” said Thatcher.\n\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Blackwood. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Raven, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Alexander Blackwood. He looked at Thatcher, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n\n“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”\n\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand and dated at the top. “O Thatcher!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.”\n\n“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Thatcher.\n\n“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no cause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows:\n\n\n“My dear Blackwood,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Faulkner warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n\n“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\n\n“HENRY JEKYLL.”\n\n“There was a third enclosure?” asked Blackwood.\n\n“Here, sir,” said Thatcher, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places.\n\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”\n\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Blackwood, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.\n\nDR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion, Dr. Hawthorne. I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:\n\n“10th December, 18—.\n\n“Dear Faulkner,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, ‘Hawthorne, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Faulkner, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.\n\n“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Thatcher, my butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\n\n“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.\n\n“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Faulkner and save\n\n“Your friend,\n\n“H.J.\n\n“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear Faulkner, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Dr. Hawthorne.”\n\n\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Hawthorne’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Hawthorne’s private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square.\n\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Hawthorne’s private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!” All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Hawthorne’s investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\n\nTwelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n\n“Are you come from Dr. Hawthorne?” I asked.\n\nHe told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste.\n\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred.\n\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world.\n\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement.\n\n“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me.\n\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster.\n\n“I beg your pardon, Dr. Faulkner,” he replied civilly enough. “What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Dr. Hawthorne, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria—“I understood, a drawer...”\n\nBut here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity.\n\n“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\n\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason.\n\n“Compose yourself,” said I.\n\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have you a graduated glass?” he asked.\n\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked.\n\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\n\n“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.”\n\n“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.”\n\n“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Faulkner, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors—behold!”\n\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\n\n“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before my eyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Dr. Hawthorne!\n\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing, Blackwood, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Hawthorne’s own confession, known by the name of Raven and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Wentworth.\n\nHASTIE LANYON.\n\nHENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they dissociated?\n\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul.\n\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion.\n\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.\n\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Raven.\n\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Raven was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Dr. Hawthorne. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Raven, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Raven, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.\n\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Dr. Hawthorne.\n\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend.

At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Raven. Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Dr. Hawthorne, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Raven. I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Raven was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Raven (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Hawthorne, I could enter on that of Raven without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\n\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Raven would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Dr. Hawthorne.\n\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of Raven, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone. Dr. Hawthorne stood at times aghast before the acts of Raven; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was Raven, after all, and Raven alone, that was guilty. Hawthorne was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Raven. And thus his conscience slumbered.\n\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Raven had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Dr. Hawthorne. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Raven himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Philip, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Raven. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Dr. Hawthorne (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size; it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of Raven.\n\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Dr. Hawthorne, I had awakened Raven. How was this to be explained? I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Whitaker stared and drew back at seeing Raven at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Hawthorne had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.\n\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Raven had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Raven become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Hawthorne, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. Hawthorne (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Raven; but Raven was indifferent to Hawthorne, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit. Hawthorne had more than a father’s interest; Raven had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot with Hawthorne, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Raven, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Hawthorne would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Raven would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it.\n\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Raven. I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Raven, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Raven struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught.\n\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Raven. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.\n\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Raven had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Dr. Hawthorne, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Raven was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel!\n\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of Raven was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. Hawthorne was now my city of refuge; let but Raven peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Raven; the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation.\n\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Raven. A moment before I had been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Hawthorne perhaps might have succumbed, Raven rose to the importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Faulkner. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Hawthorne? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end.\n\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Raven in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Faulkner and one to Thatcher; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n\nWhen I came to myself at Faulkner’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Raven that racked me. I received Faulkner’s condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope.\n\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Raven. It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Hawthorne. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Raven that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Raven seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Hawthorne. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Hawthorne, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Raven, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Raven for Hawthorne was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Hawthorne was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\n\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without efficiency. You will learn from Thatcher how I have had London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught.\n\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that Dr. Hawthorne can think his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Raven will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace. Will Raven die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself.

The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Ryder, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.”\n\n“That is all right,” said the Mind Analyst.\n\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.”\n\n“There I object,” said Ryder. “Of course a solid body may exist. All real things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?”\n\n“Don’t follow you,” said Ryder.\n\n“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?”\n\nRyder became pensive. “Clearly,” the Chrono Voyager proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”\n\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Chrono Voyager, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. “Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?”\n\n“I have not,” said the Town Leader.\n\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?”\n\n“I think so,” murmured the Town Leader; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Chrono Voyager, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\n\n“But,” said the Healer, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n\n“Not exactly,” said the Healer. “There are balloons.”\n\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\n\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Healer.\n\n“Easier, far easier down than up.”\n\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.”\n\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Mind Analyst. ’You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.”\n\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\n\n“Oh, this,” began Ryder, “is all—”\n\n“Why not?” said the Chrono Voyager.\n\n“It’s against reason,” said Ryder.\n\n“What reason?” said the Chrono Voyager.\n\n“You can show black is white by argument,” said Ryder, “but you will never convince me.”\n\n“Possibly not,” said the Chrono Voyager. “But now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Youngster.\n\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.”\n\nRyder contented himself with laughter.\n\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Chrono Voyager.\n\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Mind Analyst suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\n\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Healer. “Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\n\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the Youngster thought.\n\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.”\n\n“Then there is the future,” said the Youngster. “Just think! One might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!”\n\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic basis.”\n\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Mind Analyst.\n\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\n\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify that?”\n\n“The experiment!” cried Ryder, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Mind Analyst, “though it’s all humbug, you know.”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.\n\nThe Mind Analyst looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\n\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Healer, and Ryder tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the Chrono Voyager came back, and Ryder’s anecdote collapsed.\n\nII.\nThe Machine\nThe thing the Chrono Voyager held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Chrono Voyager and the fireplace. Ryder sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Healer and the Town Leader watched him in profile from the right, the Mind Analyst from the left. The Youngster stood behind the Mind Analyst. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.\n\nThe Chrono Voyager looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?” said the Mind Analyst.\n\n“This little affair,” said the Chrono Voyager, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one little white lever, and here is another.”\n\nThe Healer got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. “It’s beautifully made,” he said.\n\n“It took two years to make,” retorted the Chrono Voyager. Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Healer, he said: “Now I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a quack.”\n\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Mind Analyst seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Chrono Voyager put forth his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your hand.” And turning to the Mind Analyst, he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Mind Analyst himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Ryder said he was damned.\n\nThe Mind Analyst recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At that the Chrono Voyager laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he said, with a reminiscence of the Mind Analyst. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe.\n\nWe stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Healer, “are you in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Chrono Voyager, stooping to light a spill at the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Mind Analyst’s face. (The Mind Analyst, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.”\n\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said Ryder.\n\n“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\n\nAfter an interval the Mind Analyst had an inspiration. “It must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.\n\n“Why?” said the Chrono Voyager.\n\n“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time.”\n\n“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”\n\n“Serious objections,” remarked the Town Leader, with an air of impartiality, turning towards the Chrono Voyager.\n\n“Not a bit,” said the Chrono Voyager, and, to the Mind Analyst: “You think. You can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.”\n\n“Of course,” said the Mind Analyst, and reassured us. “That’s a simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You see?” he said, laughing.\n\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Chrono Voyager asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Healer; “but wait until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\n\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Chrono Voyager. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\n\n“Look here,” said the Healer, “are you perfectly serious? Or is this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”\n\n“Upon that machine,” said the Chrono Voyager, holding the lamp aloft, “I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.”\n\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\n\nI caught Ryder’s eye over the shoulder of the Healer, and he winked at me solemnly.\n\nIII.\nThe Chrono Voyager Returns\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Chrono Voyager was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Ryder shown the model and explained the matter in the Chrono Voyager’s words, we should have shown him far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Ryder. But the Chrono Voyager had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Healer, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\n\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the Chrono Voyager’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Healer was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Chrono Voyager, and—“It’s half-past seven now,” said the Healer. “I suppose we’d better have dinner?”\n\n“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.\n\n“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says he’ll explain when he comes.”\n\n“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Script Keeper of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\n\nThe Mind Analyst was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Script Keeper aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Chrono Voyager’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Script Keeper wanted that explained to him, and the Mind Analyst volunteered a wooden account of the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the Chrono Voyager stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Healer, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\n\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\n\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion towards the wine. The Script Keeper filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The Chrono Voyager did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught. “That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\n\nHe looked across at the Script Keeper, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was all right. The Script Keeper began a question. “Tell you presently,” said the Chrono Voyager. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”\n\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I heard the Script Keeper say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.\n\n“What’s the game?” said the Story Scribe. “Has he been doing the Amateur Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Mind Analyst, and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Chrono Voyager limping painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.\n\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Healer, who rang the bell—the Chrono Voyager hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Script Keeper turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment; and then the Script Keeper got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Mind Analyst’s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Script Keeper raised objections. “What was this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?” And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Story Scribe too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Script Keeper in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Story Scribe was saying—or rather shouting—when the Chrono Voyager came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.\n\n“I say,” said the Script Keeper hilariously, “these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”\n\n“Story!” cried the Script Keeper.\n\n“Story be damned!” said the Chrono Voyager. “I want something to eat. I won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.”\n\n“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Chrono Voyager, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\n\n“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Script Keeper. The Chrono Voyager pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Story Scribe tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Chrono Voyager devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Healer smoked a cigarette, and watched the Chrono Voyager through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Chrono Voyager pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\n\n“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\n\n“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Script Keeper.\n\n“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?”\n\n“Agreed,” said the Script Keeper, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with that the Chrono Voyager began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Story Scribe and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Chrono Voyager’s face.\n\nIV.\nTime Travelling\n>\n“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\n\n“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Ms. Keeper came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\n“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\n\n“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\n\n“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of stopping.\n\n“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air.\n\n“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud ", "context_order": 0, "question": "What was the material of the ivory bars that were part of the Time Machine?", "answer": "Quartz."}

In a moment I was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you.’\n\n“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n\n“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.\n\n“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently slain.\n\n“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.\n\n“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\n\n“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.\n\n“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from the machine.\n\nV.\nIn the Golden Age\n“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\n“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.\n\n“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\n\n“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.\n\n“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time Machine in vain.\n\n“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind.\n\n“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.\n\n“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\n\n“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange.\n\n“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure.\n\n“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong, silky material.\n\n“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their import.\n\n“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’ But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued.\n\nVI.\nThe Sunset of Mankind\n“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop examining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own devices.\n\n“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.\n\n“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in its proper place.\n\n“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared.\n\n“‘Communism,’ said I to myself.\n\n“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.\n\n“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\n\n“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\n“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise, corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\n\n“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\n\n“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more secure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\n“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.\n\n“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had leapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\n\n“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\n\n“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. Now, where are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.\n\n“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\n“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be hindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.\n\n“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\n\n“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible enough—as most wrong theories are!\n\nVII.\nA Sudden Shock\n“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could sleep.\n\n“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly to myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’\n\n“But it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\n\n“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world.\n\n“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.\n\n“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\n\n“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\n\n“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my Time Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten.\n\n“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n\n“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself. ‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n\n“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine. There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n\n“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n\n“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my ", "context_order": 1, "question": "What kind of diet do the people of the future follow in the text?", "answer": "They are strict vegetarians, eating only fruit."}

I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is another matter.\n\n“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels, and if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\n\n“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n\nVIII.\nExplanation\n“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight.\n\n“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\n\n“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I can convey very little of the difference to your mind.\n\n“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none.\n\n“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things were kept going.\n\n“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!\n\n“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.\n\n“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was Luna, which, though I don’t know what it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!\n\n“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\n\n“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Luna’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes.\n\n“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\n\n“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted my eyes.\n\n“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere creatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I wonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning, until Luna’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine. But Luna was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\n\n“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it.\n\n“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\n\n“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\n\n“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared.\n\n“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages.\n\n“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\n\n“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Luna, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\n\n“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\n\n“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact, except along the river valley—showed how universal were its ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth.\n\n“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the end—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth?\n\n“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.\n\n“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the beautiful race that I already knew.\n\n“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to question Luna about this Underworld, but here again I was disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from Luna’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.\n\nIX.\nThe Morlocks\n“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.\n\n“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Luna was among them—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\n“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Luna. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium.\n\n“Little Luna ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Luna,’ I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\n\n“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Luna’s head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Luna had disappeared.\n\n“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.\n\n“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\n\n“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it now,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\n\n“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\n\n“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I missed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me.\n\n“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and t", "context_order": 2, "question": "What name did the Time Traveler's new friend introduce herself as after he rescued her from drowning?", "answer": "Luna."}

I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\n\n“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\n\n“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Luna kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\n\nX.\nWhen Night Came\n“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\n\n“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Luna had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.\n\n“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me.\n\n“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Luna like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.\n\n“Luna had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Luna, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\n\n“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Luna grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine?\n\n“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Luna’s fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue—a Faun, or some such figure, minus the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.\n\n“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were very sore—I carefully lowered Luna from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.\n\n“Luna, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\n\n“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Luna sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\n\n“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.\n\n“I awakened Luna, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Luna dancing at my side!\n\n“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear.\n\n“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Luna I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\n\nXI.\nThe Palace of Green Porcelain\n“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I never followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things in the sea.\n\n“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Luna might help me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\n\n“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.\n\n“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Luna, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me.\n\n“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my mind.\n\n“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\n\n“Suddenly Luna came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Luna’s increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well.\n\n“I took Luna’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Luna, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Luna, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.\n\n“Well, mace in one hand and Luna in the other, I went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.\n\n“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Luna. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Luna’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know.\n\n“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\n“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy.\n\n“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\n\n“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work.\n\nXII.\nIn the Darkness\n“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Luna was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Luna would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\n\n“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat.\n\n“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Luna.\n\n“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Luna clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n\n“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Luna shivered violently, and became quite still.\n\n“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at Luna. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!\n\n“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In manœuvring with my matches and Luna, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Luna, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes shone like carbuncles.\n\n“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms that had been approaching Luna dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on", "context_order": 3, "question": "What did the protagonist use to defend himself against the Morlocks in the Palace of Green Porcelain?", "answer": "A mace created from a broken lever."}

So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where Luna lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n\n“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free.\n\n“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Luna were lost, but I determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight.\n\n“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Luna, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!\n\n“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more of them.\n\n“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Luna. But Luna was gone.\n\n“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.\n\n“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.\n\n“I searched again for traces of Luna, but there were none. It was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Luna. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain.\n\n“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\n\nXIII.\nThe Trap of the White Sphinx\n“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Luna, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And their end was the same.\n\n“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\n\n“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\n\n“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed. Matron Urgency, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you.\n\n“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep.\n\n“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\n\n“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves.\n\n“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\n“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it.\n\n“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.\n\n“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\n\n“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box.\n\n“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.\n\n“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described.\n\nXIV.\nThe Further Vision\n“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch—into futurity.\n\n“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible.\n\n“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight.\n\n“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.\n\n“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.\n\n“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\n\n“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\n\n“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate, watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\n\n“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little.\n\n“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth.\n\n“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\n\n“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\n\nXV.\nThe Chrono Voyager’s Return\n“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism down.\n\n“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Ms. Keeper had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to see Lancaster for a moment; but he passed like a flash.\n\n“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and the whole thing have been a dream.\n\n“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\n\n“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.\n\nXVI.\nAfter the Story\n“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Healer. “No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”\n\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes off the Chrono Voyager’s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam before them. The Healer seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host. The Script Keeper was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the sixth. The Story Scribe fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, were motionless.\n\nThe Script Keeper stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer of stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Chrono Voyager’s shoulder.\n\n“You don’t believe it?”\n\n“Well——”\n\n“I thought not.”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I hardly believe it myself..... And yet...”\n\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.\n\nThe Healer rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The gynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Mind Analyst leant forward to see, holding out his hand for a specimen.\n\n“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Story Scribe. “How shall we get home?”\n\n“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Mind Analyst.\n\n“It’s a curious thing,” said the Healer; “but I certainly don’t know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”\n\nThe Chrono Voyager hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”\n\n“Where did you really get them?” said the Healer.\n\nThe Chrono Voyager put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my pocket by Luna, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room. “I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I must look at that machine. If there is one!”\n\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n\nThe Chrono Voyager put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.” He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room.\n\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Script Keeper on with his coat. The Healer looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\n\nI shared a cab with the Script Keeper. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day and see the Chrono Voyager again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Chrono Voyager met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in there.”\n\n“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”\n\n“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,” he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my leaving you now?”\n\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Harrington, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Chrono Voyager.\n\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Chrono Voyager was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\n\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.\n\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out that way?” said I.\n\n“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him here.”\n\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Harrington I stayed on, waiting for the Chrono Voyager; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Chrono Voyager vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned.\n\nEpilogue\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of ma", "context_order": 4, "question": "What did the Time Traveler find in his trouser pocket after the fire in the forest?", "answer": "Some loose matches."}
