Washington's approach?", "prediction": "According to Du Bois, education plays a critical but complex role in African American progress. He sees it as essential for developing leadership, self-understanding, and social advancement, but disagrees with Booker T. Washington's emphasis solely on industrial and vocational training.\n\nDu Bois argues that while practical skills are important, true progress requires a broader, more holistic education that includes:\n\n1. Higher learning and liberal arts education\n2. Developing intellectual and cultural leadership\n3. Cultivating critical thinking and social consciousness\n4. Training a \"Talented Tenth\" who can guide the broader community\n5. Providing pathways to professional and intellectual careers\n\nHe criticizes Washington's approach as too accommodating to white supremacy and limiting African Americans to manual labor. Du Bois believes education should not just prepare individuals for economic survival, but should empower them to challenge systemic racism and pursue full civic and human rights.\n\nThe goal of education, in Du Bois's view, is not just individual advancement, but collective uplift and the eventual dismantling of racial barriers through knowledge, culture, and principled leadership.", "ground_truth": "Du Bois highlights the necessity of higher education to solve deep-seated racial inequalities and train black leaders, while Booker T. Washington emphasizes industrial education and economic self-reliance as paths to progress, reflecting differing views on the best approach to African American advancement."}

This excerpt focuses on Lucas and Elena, who have different perspectives on love, weight, and life's experiences.\n\nThe text explores themes of lightness and weight through Lucas and Elena's relationship, particularly in how they perceive their life choices, love, and the weight of their actions. For instance, Elena often feels responsible for Lucas's reduced professional status, while Lucas seems more at peace with their life changes, seeing freedom from \"missions\" as a relief.\n\nIf you'd like an analysis of Tomas and Tereza's perspectives, I would need the specific section of the novel that discusses their views on love and infidelity.", "ground_truth": "Tomas views love and sexuality as separate and pursues infidelities lightly, seeking freedom from emotional weight, whereas Tereza seeks a unique and binding connection through fidelity, viewing infidelities as a betrayal that threaten the foundation of her relationship with Tomas."}

Their relationship is characterized by Elena's perceived weakness and Lucas's changing sense of purpose, rather than the specific dynamic between Tereza and Tomas that you're asking about.\n\nIf you'd like an analysis of \"Es muss sein!\" in this specific text, I can provide that.
