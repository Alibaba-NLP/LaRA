Reduced market exclusivity: If patent term extensions are not granted or are shorter than requested, competitors may more quickly develop similar products.\n\n2. Shortened protection period: Limited extensions could shorten the timeframe during which MindMed has exclusive rights to its product candidates.\n\n3. Financial implications: Shorter patent protection could reduce the potential revenue window for commercialized products.\n\n4. Competitive disadvantage: Less robust patent protection might make it harder to prevent competitors from entering the market with similar therapies.\n\n5.
