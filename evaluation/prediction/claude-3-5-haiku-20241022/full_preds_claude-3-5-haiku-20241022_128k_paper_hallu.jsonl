Predictive resource allocation using:\n- Performance models for prefill and decode phases\n- Estimated input/output token length distributions\n- Predicted resource usage for each request\n\n3. Dynamic resource management:\n- Monitors ongoing request characteristics\n- Adjusts request placement to reduce impact of output length prediction errors\n- Can re-balance workloads across workers\n\n4. SLO-aware scheduling:\n- Uses Average Token Generation Time (ATGT) metric\n- Ensures service quality across different request types\n- Prevents any single request type from monopolizing resources\n\n5. Adaptive instance configuration:\n- Can dynamically adjust number of workers\n- Scales resources based on changing arrival rates and workload patterns\n\nThe scheduler aims to maximize per-GPU goodput while maintaining fairness by carefully predicting and distributing computational load across available resources.", "ground_truth": "Paper 2 does not discuss how the Aladdin scheduler ensures fairness in resource allocation across multiple LLM inference tasks in relation to regional server loads."}
