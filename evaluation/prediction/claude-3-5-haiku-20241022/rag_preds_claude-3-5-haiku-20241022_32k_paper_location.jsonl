Stronger coupling within each chain\n2. Increased chain integrity\n3. Reduced chain breaks\n4. Greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients\n\nThe key benefit is that the 4-clique chains can use weaker chain strengths while still successfully performing computational tasks, which can improve the quantum annealing process.", "ground_truth": "The 4-clique minor embedding allows for stronger coupling within each chain, which increases chain integrity and reduces chain breaks, allowing for greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients."}
