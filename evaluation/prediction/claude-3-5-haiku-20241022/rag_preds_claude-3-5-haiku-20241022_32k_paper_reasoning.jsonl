SVM has a predictor function complexity of O(1), while Softmax has a predictor function complexity of O(n). This difference in computational complexity allows the GRU-SVM model to achieve faster training and testing times, as demonstrated in the experimental results where the GRU-SVM model finished training and testing slightly quicker than the GRU-Softmax model.", "ground_truth": "The use of SVM in the GRU-SVM model results in reduced prediction time because SVM's prediction complexity is O(1), allowing constant time predictions, whereas Softmax has a prediction complexity of O(n), which increases with the number of classes.

Scale: Smaller language models have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors. Choosing the smallest model in the same family as the expert model helps identify and downweight undesirable generation behaviors.\n\n2. Temperature: Adjusting the amateur model's temperature can highlight or flatten its error-prone distribution, allowing fine-tuning of the contrastive decoding process.\n\n3. Context window: Restricting the amateur model's context window can weaken its coherence, helping to emphasize the expert model's strengths.\n\nThe key benefit of choosing a smaller model is that it more clearly reveals the failure modes of language models (like repetition or irrelevance), which can then be systematically removed during the contrastive decoding process. The paper notes that better performance is achieved when there is a larger scale difference between the expert and amateur models.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

FaR introduces two key components:\n- Foresee: Prompting models to predict future events based on observations\n- Reflect: Reasoning about which action best helps characters facing potential challenges\n\n2.
