Exploitative economic systems:\n- High rents and unfair crop-lien arrangements that kept tenants in perpetual debt\n- Merchants and landlords who took advantage through high interest rates and unfair pricing\n- Lack of access to fair credit and banking\n\n2. Legal and social barriers:\n- Limited legal protections and difficulty accessing courts\n- Discrimination in land sales and business dealings\n- Restricted mobility due to laws and social customs\n\n3. Systemic disadvantages:\n- Starting with no capital or resources after emancipation\n- Poor educational opportunities\n- Limited political power to advocate for reforms\n\nThese local challenges reflected the broader post-Civil War struggles of freedmen trying to achieve economic independence while facing systematic obstacles designed to maintain their subordination. The situation in Dougherty County exemplified how economic exploitation and social discrimination worked together to restrict black advancement across the South.", "ground_truth": "Black tenants and landowners in Dougherty County faced economic exploitation, such as high rents and unfair practices, reflecting broader social issues like racial prejudice, lack of economic opportunity, and the struggle for self-sufficiency following Emancipation."}

Washington's approach?", "prediction": "According to Du Bois, education plays a vital dual role in African American progress:\n\nFirst, he sees higher education as essential for developing Black leadership and teachers who can guide the broader community's advancement. He criticizes Booker T. Washington's exclusive focus on industrial/vocational training, arguing that the race needs both skilled workers AND educated intellectuals who can fight for civil rights and provide cultural/moral leadership.\n\nSecond, Du Bois views education as key to human dignity and full citizenship, beyond just economic opportunity. He believes limiting Black education to manual skills, as Washington advocated, implicitly accepts second-class status. Instead, Du Bois argues that African Americans deserve access to both liberal arts education and practical training to develop their full human potential and participate fully in American democracy.\n\nIn essence, Du Bois sees education as crucial for both practical advancement and the higher goal of full human liberation, rather than just economic survival.", "ground_truth": "Du Bois highlights the necessity of higher education to solve deep-seated racial inequalities and train black leaders, while Booker T. Washington emphasizes industrial education and economic self-reliance as paths to progress, reflecting differing views on the best approach to African American advancement."}

Clara and Julian Vega, a young bullfighter she becomes involved with during the fiesta\n3.

His own view: He sees his relationships as deeply meaningful and believes he is entitled to continued emotional connection with women he's been involved with, especially Clara. He takes rejection personally and refuses to accept when relationships end.\n\n2. Others' view: The narrator and other characters see his behavior as clingy, possessive, and inappropriate. They view him as someone who doesn't understand social boundaries and becomes pathetically desperate when rejected, exemplified by his stalking of Clara and his emotional breakdown after she leaves him for the young bullfighter.\n\nThese contrasting perceptions highlight Munson/Cohn's inability to handle romantic relationships with the casual detachment that characterizes the other expatriate characters.", "ground_truth": "In the first part, Cohn's entanglements are perceived as naive and impulsive, particularly with Frances, while in the latter part, his involvement with Brett and subsequent actions are viewed by others as obsessive and detrimental."}

With Munson: Their affair was unsatisfying and left her feeling guilty. His possessiveness and emotional neediness pushed her away.\n\n3. With Julian Vega: She falls intensely for the young bullfighter but chooses to leave him, recognizing she would ultimately damage him. This shows her self-awareness and capacity for sacrifice.\n\n4. With Jake/Sam: Their relationship is one of deep understanding and connection, but they can't be together romantically due to his war injury. This creates an underlying tragedy to their interactions.\n\nThese relationships demonstrate Clara's restlessness, her tendency to seek escape through new relationships, and her ultimate inability to find lasting happiness despite genuine feelings for the men in her life.", "ground_truth": "Brett's relationship with Jake shows deep, unresolved love and complexity, while her interactions with Cohn and Romero display a pattern of emotional entanglements and the resulting troubles."}

This allows him to separate love from sex and pursue affairs without feeling they diminish his love for Tereza.\n\nIn contrast, Tereza sees actions and experiences as heavy with meaning. Her jealousy and dreams reveal she views Tomas's infidelities as weighty betrayals that cause her deep suffering.

Key parallels:\n\n1. Elena feels inadequate due to Lucas's infidelities and sees herself as \"weak\" compared to his \"strength,\" much like how Tereza feels unworthy compared to Tomas's mistresses.\n\n2.

The power dynamic shifts when they move to the countryside, where Lucas/Tomas accepts losing his career and embraces a simpler life with Elena/Tereza, suggesting a rejection of his previous 'Es muss sein!' of womanizing and career ambitions.\n\nThis transformation illustrates how 'Es muss sein!' can both bind people together through obligation but also be transcended through conscious choice and acceptance of a different kind of necessity.", "ground_truth": "Tereza's feelings of inadequacy and her perception of Tomas's infidelities highlight the weighty, almost inescapable mandate of 'Es muss sein!' as a representation of her struggles with identity and love, while Tomas's reflections on his choices and his professional sacrifices depict 'Es muss sein!' as an internal imperative that drives his existential decisions and his eventual search for a lighter, more liberated existence."}
