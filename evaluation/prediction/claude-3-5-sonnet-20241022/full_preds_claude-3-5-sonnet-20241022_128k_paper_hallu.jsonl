MC-ViT-KM (k-means)\n\nThe paper actually finds that MC-ViT-KM (k-means) performs better than the other methods, and uses it as the default approach due to:\n1. Greater computational efficiency \n2. Slightly higher performance for larger sets of memories\n3. Similar robustness to other consolidation algorithms\n\nThe paper does not present advantages of a trilateral process over k-means, as k-means is their preferred method.", "ground_truth": "Paper 2 does not discuss any specific advantages or implementation details of a trilateral memory consolidation process compared to the k-means approach for long-context video understanding."}
