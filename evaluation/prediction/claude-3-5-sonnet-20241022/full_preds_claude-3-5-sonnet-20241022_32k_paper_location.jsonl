This enables the use of weaker chain strengths while still successfully carrying out computations, leaving more of the available energy scale for programming the actual problem coefficients rather than dedicating it to ferromagnetic chains.", "ground_truth": "The 4-clique minor embedding allows for stronger coupling within each chain, which increases chain integrity and reduces chain breaks, allowing for greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients."}
