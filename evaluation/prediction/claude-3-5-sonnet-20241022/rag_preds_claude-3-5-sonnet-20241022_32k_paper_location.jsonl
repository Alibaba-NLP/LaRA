Stronger coupling within each chain\n2. Increased chain integrity\n3. Reduced chain breaks\n4. Greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients\n\nThe key benefit is that the 4-clique chains, while using more qubits, can provide more robust embedding compared to linear path embeddings, especially for maintaining the logical problem state during quantum annealing.", "ground_truth": "The 4-clique minor embedding allows for stronger coupling within each chain, which increases chain integrity and reduces chain breaks, allowing for greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients."}
