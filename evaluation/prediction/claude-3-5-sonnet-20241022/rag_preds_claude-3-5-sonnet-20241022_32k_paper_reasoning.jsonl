Smaller models have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors, which helps highlight the expert model's strengths.\n\n2. The scale difference allows the method to emphasize desirable outputs from the expert model while de-emphasizing common failure modes found in smaller models.\n\n3. The authors recommend choosing the smallest model in the same family as the expert model (e.g., OPT-125M for an OPT-13B expert).\n\nThe paper also suggests manipulating the amateur model's temperature and context window to further adjust its behavior and weaken its capacity, which helps improve the contrastive decoding performance.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models.

Foresee: Prompting models to predict potential future events and challenges based on current observations\n2. Reflect: Guiding models to reason which action choice would best help characters facing potential challenges\n\nKey advantages:\n- Significantly improves zero-shot performance (boosting GPT-4 accuracy from 50% to 71%)\n- More effective than other prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought or Tree-of-Thought\n- Helps LLMs structure reasoning by encouraging forward-thinking and action-oriented reasoning\n- Both \"foresee\" and \"reflect\" components are crucial for performance\n\nThe framework is conceptually similar to A* search algorithm, using future predictions as heuristics to guide reasoning toward optimal action decisions.

If an LLM truly has the ability to self-correct, it should have provided the correct answer in its initial attempt.\n\n2.
