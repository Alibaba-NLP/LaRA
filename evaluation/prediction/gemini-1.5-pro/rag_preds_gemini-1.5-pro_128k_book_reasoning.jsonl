It also develops individual potential and contributes to a richer, more nuanced society.\n", "ground_truth": "The author argues that education helps create a skilled and cultured leadership among Black men who can guide others, amidst economic and racial challenges. Without proper education, the community risks falling prey to demagogues, and the tension between races would hinder progress. For lasting improvement, education must address both practical skills and moral development to elevate the race beyond just manual labor."}

Without political power, they cannot influence taxation, law enforcement, or labor conditions, which undermines the long-term economic development of both Black laborers and the broader Southern economy that relies on their labor."}

It describes Cormac's internal struggle and then says he felt the full weight of his burden, implying the conditions were a heavy weight.  It then skips ahead to his twenty years of wandering.\n", "ground_truth": "Ambrose Cormac rejects Bishop Winthrope's conditions, which prohibited him from sitting in the church convention or seeking representation for his Negro church, because he saw these terms as an unjust denial of equality and recognition for his race.

This, and a later injury, flatten his nose.  He over-intellectualizes, retreating into books and wearing spectacles.  His shyness and self-consciousness persist, influencing his passive romantic choices and leading him into unsatisfying relationships where he is easily controlled.\n", "ground_truth": "Gregory Munson learns boxing as a way to cope with his sense of inferiority when treated differently for being Jewish at Princeton.

Her mother’s manipulations and Lucas’s infidelities mirror each other, leading her to feel powerless.
