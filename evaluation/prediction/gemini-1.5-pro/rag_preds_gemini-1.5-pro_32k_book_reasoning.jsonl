A simplified endgame scenario in draughts highlights this, as strategic depth becomes crucial when tactical complexities are reduced.\n", "ground_truth": "The narrator concludes that draughts better exercises the intellect because, unlike chess where attention is heavily taxed due to the complexity of piece movements, draughts relies on simple, limited moves.
