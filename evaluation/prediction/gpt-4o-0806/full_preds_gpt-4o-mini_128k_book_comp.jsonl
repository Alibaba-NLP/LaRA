The primary obstacles included economic exploitation through the crop-lien system, where tenants had to secure advances for living expenses against future crops, often leading to debt and poverty. The lack of capital meant black farmers were vulnerable to high rents and predatory lending.\n\nSocially, systemic racism and discrimination hindered economic independence and mobility, leaving black tenants with little bargaining power and often at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords and merchants. Landowners, while slightly better off, struggled with the limitations imposed by a racist society that often denied them fair market opportunities and subjected them to legal disadvantages.\n\nThese obstacles underscored a vicious cycle of economic disenfranchisement and social marginalization that was emblematic of the broader struggles faced by freedmen across the South, where systemic inequalities persisted well beyond Emancipation.", "ground_truth": "Black tenants and landowners in Dougherty County faced economic exploitation, such as high rents and unfair practices, reflecting broader social issues like racial prejudice, lack of economic opportunity, and the struggle for self-sufficiency following Emancipation."}

After Emancipation, many black individuals found themselves with limited access to education and economic opportunities. The lack of access to quality education hindered their ability to advance socially and economically, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and oppression. Moreover, the economic system, particularly in the Southern United States, exploited black labor through the crop-lien system and sharecropping, keeping many black workers in a state of debt and dependency. The book highlights the importance of education as a means of empowerment and upliftment, advocating for the establishment of institutions that could provide the necessary training and leadership for black communities. Without changes in educational and economic conditions, the struggle for true freedom and equality remained challenging.", "ground_truth": "In the context discussed, educational deprivation and economic exploitation together form a cycle that hinders black progress, as political disfranchisement limits access to resources that could break this cycle, causing a prevalence of poverty and reduced opportunities."}

Following Emancipation, he believed education was essential for transforming former slaves into informed, self-reliant citizens who could participate fully in American democracy and economic life. He advocated for a broad liberal arts education that would cultivate leaders and foster critical thinking and self-awareness.\n\nIn contrast, Booker T. Washington's approach, as noted by Du Bois, emphasized industrial and vocational training, advocating for African Americans to acquire practical skills to improve their economic standing. Washington's approach focused on accommodation and gradual acceptance of social segregation while improving economic self-sufficiency.\n\nDu Bois criticized Washington’s approach as overly accommodating and believed it limited the potential and rights of African Americans by neglecting higher education and political activism necessary for full equality and citizenship.", "ground_truth": "Du Bois highlights the necessity of higher education to solve deep-seated racial inequalities and train black leaders, while Booker T. Washington emphasizes industrial education and economic self-reliance as paths to progress, reflecting differing views on the best approach to African American advancement."}
