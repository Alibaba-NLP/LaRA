Knowledge editing directly alters parameters to update specific knowledge, while generalization work involves compressing model parameters to support better generalization bounds and efficiency.\n\n3. **Adaptability and Scalability**: Both papers emphasize improving the adaptability of models to retain relevant knowledge and adapt to new information, whether it's through efficient parameter tuning or through generalizing from large-scale data, thereby enhancing the models' applicability in diverse contexts.\n\nIn essence, both areas focus on making LLMs more flexible and computationally efficient while ensuring their outputs are reliable and aligned with updated knowledge or generalization standards.", "ground_truth": "Both papers address the challenge of managing vast parameter spaces in LLMs; paper 0 focuses on efficient and effective post-hoc modifications to LLMs to maintain or enhance knowledge without retraining, while paper 2 develops non-vacuous generalization bounds to confirm LLMs' ability to generalize beyond training data."}
