This disaggregation ensures that each phase of LLM inference operates independently, minimizing interference and allowing for distributed processing. While TetriInfer's primary focus is on optimizing performance and efficiency through careful scheduling and resource management, its design inherently supports data integrity by isolating different phases and reducing the complexity of managing mixed workloads, which can contribute to enhanced security in cloud environments.
