The framework involves generating tool-use instances through self-exploration, examining the expected input-output mechanism for each tool, and transforming specific instances into general tool protocols by decomposing the response into a general schema. Additionally, the chain of probing algorithms further enhances the process by optimizing the cooperation among tools with strong input-output dependencies.", "ground_truth": "The ATC framework addresses the challenge of undocumented tool protocols by employing a black-box probing method, which allows the LLM to actively discover and document new tool usages through instance discovery and protocol documenting.

This combination prevents the occurrence of price-supply inversions, stabilizing the sequence and leading it towards convergence. Thus, starting from a subsolution or a supersolution, the sequence's trajectory becomes predictable and ultimately converges to a unique equilibrium, as shown in the convergence theorems (Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 for M-functions, and Theorem 2.4 for M0-functions) outlined in the paper.", "ground_truth": "The Jacobi sequence is likely to converge because nonreversing $Q$ functions are M-functions or M0-functions, which have properties ensuring that sequences initialized from subsolutions or supersolutions will converge.
