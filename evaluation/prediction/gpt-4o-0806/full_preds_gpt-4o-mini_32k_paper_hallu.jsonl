Admin achieves this by adaptively initializing parameters to control the dependency on residual branches, ensuring a more balanced contribution during training. This method allows the network to maintain stability without sacrificing performance potential, ultimately leading to faster convergence and better results in Transformer models.", "ground_truth": "Paper 1 does not discuss the application or improvement of the Admin method for image classification tasks."}
