Choosing a smaller model as the amateur is beneficial because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as repetition and incoherence, more prominently than larger models.

This limitation stems from their nature as approximate knowledge sources that lack the structured reasoning required for planning tasks. As a result, their performance in generating correct plans autonomously is poor, with only about 12% of plans being executable without errors, according to studies cited in the paper. This indicates that LLMs are more likely engaged in approximate retrieval rather than true planning.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

Both approaches are designed to use the same fixed computation budget per language. Multilingual instruction tuning involves merging and shuffling data across all languages, costing the same as tuning individual models for each language. This budget parity implies that multilingual tuning can be a more resource-efficient approach, allowing a model to support multiple languages without additional costs compared to training separate models for each language.

A smaller \\( E \\) leads to a heavier communication burden, as more frequent communication rounds are required. Conversely, a larger \\( E \\) can reduce communication rounds but may slow down convergence since local models might diverge due to non-iid data. The paper suggests that \\( E \\) should not be set too small (which would make FedAvg equivalent to SGD) or too large (risking divergence), as both extremes can lead to inefficient convergence. The reasoning for an optimal \\( E \\) lies in striking a balance where local updates are substantial enough to benefit from reduced communication but not so extensive that they undermine convergence due to data heterogeneity. An optimal \\( E \\) minimizes the overall required communication rounds to achieve a specific accuracy, as indicated by the function \\( \\frac{T_{\\epsilon}}{E} \\) which first decreases and then increases, implying that there exists an optimal \\( E \\).", "ground_truth": "In paper 0, the number of local iterations \\( E \\) affects the trade-off such that over-small values lead to high communication costs, as they require frequent updates with the server, while over-large values slow the convergence because the local models may diverge due to non-iid data across devices. The optimal choice of \\( E \\) exists because it balances local computation with communication frequency, minimizing the overall rounds needed to achieve a desired precision."}

The self-correction process often leads LLMs to modify correct answers to incorrect ones more frequently than vice versa.

The authors suggest that without reliable external feedback, the model struggles to improve its responses, thus decreasing performance.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that LLMs cannot effectively judge the correctness of their reasoning, leading to a higher likelihood of altering correct answers to incorrect ones rather than fixing mistakes.
