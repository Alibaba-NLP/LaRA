Although he had doubts about his decision, he felt bound by an unspoken vow. His departure from medicine was partly an act of rebellion against the internal \"Es muss sein!\" that demanded fulfillment through his profession. This internal imperative had been burdensome, like a \"vampire sucking his blood.\" As a window washer, he experienced a sense of freedom and \"blissful indifference,\" feeling as if he were on a long holiday without the compulsion and heavy responsibility of his former profession.", "ground_truth": "Lucas feels morally compelled to avoid further involvement with the Communist regime and the dangers of being pressured into making a forced public statement against his principles. After losing his medical profession due to his refusal to retract his statements, he embraces window washing as a form of escape from the societal pressures and police manipulation."}

Over time, the Grand March shifts rapidly between causes, loses spectators, and becomes a symbol of futile playacting against an unresponsive world.", "ground_truth": "Hans observes that the causes the Grand March champions are inconsistent and contradictory, like supporting Israel one day and then opposing it another day.
