Choosing a smaller model is beneficial because it helps identify and downweight these undesirable behaviors, allowing the expert LM to emphasize more desirable outputs. The scale difference between the expert and amateur LM is crucial, as a larger difference leads to better performance in generating coherent and fluent text. The smaller amateur LM is also cheap to run and incurs minimal inference time overhead.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

Compared to methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting, SELF-DISCOVER requires significantly fewer inference calls—10-40 times less—while achieving better accuracy.

This method effectively guides LLMs in action-based reasoning rather than just inference-making. FaR is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought because it significantly boosts accuracy by organizing reasoning in line with the task's requirements and addressing the T4D task's inherent complexities. FaR improves LLM performance, shown by its ability to increase GPT-4's accuracy from 50% to 71% in the T4D-ToM challenge, mostly because it helps focus and refine the reasoning steps needed to inform actions.", "ground_truth": "The FaR framework helps LLMs tackle T4D's challenges by structuring reasoning through future event prediction (Foresee) and action-oriented reflection (Reflect), thus guiding the model to make appropriate inferences and actions.

This limitation leads to poor performance, as only about 12% of the plans generated by the best LLM (GPT-4) are executable without errors and reach their goals. Additionally, the performance deteriorates further if the actions and objects are obfuscated, indicating a reliance on surface-level associations rather than genuine plan generation capabilities.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

They note that without these external cues, LLMs struggle to correctly judge and rectify their reasoning errors on their own, often resulting in deteriorated performance. Additionally, issues like unfair comparisons to other methods with similar inference costs and sub-optimal prompt designs further contribute to the diminished efficacy of intrinsic self-correction.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that LLMs cannot effectively judge the correctness of their reasoning, leading to a higher likelihood of altering correct answers to incorrect ones rather than fixing mistakes.
