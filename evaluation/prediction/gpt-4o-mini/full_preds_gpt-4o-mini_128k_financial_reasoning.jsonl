The change in shares outstanding contributed to this increase as follows:\n\n- Shares outstanding on January 29, 2023: 2,466 million\n- Shares outstanding on January 28, 2024: 2,464 million\n- Shares repurchased: 21 million\n\nThis repurchase reduced the shares outstanding and contributed to the total shareholders' equity decrease due to the repurchase value (approximately $9.7 billion), which indicates a significant portion of the equity change is attributed to stock repurchases rather than new equity being issued or equity retained.\n\nThus, the contribution of the change in shares outstanding (via repurchases) to the total shareholders' equity change reflects a financial strategy impacting retained earnings and overall equity upwardly through net income, but directly contributes negatively through the repurchased shares.\n\nIn summary, the change in shares outstanding (repurchases less any issuance) has decreased shareholders' equity by around $9.7 billion from repurchases, part of the overall increase in total equity is attributed to net income generated during the year.", "ground_truth": "The number of shares outstanding decreased from 2,466 million to 2,464 million, a reduction by 2 million shares, primarily due to repurchases. This change, along with an increase in net income retained compared to dividends paid, contributed to a rise in total shareholders' equity from $22,101 million to $42,978 million, with the net income significantly boosting retained earnings."}
