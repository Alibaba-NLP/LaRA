In RAG systems, LLMs can produce incorrect answers even when relevant context is provided due to noise or conflicting information (FP4/Falsified Responses), while LLMs in CRS can provide implausible recommendations and responses due to lacking specific domain knowledge or clear knowledge guidance.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Paper 0 discusses how RAG systems struggle with contextual noise and relevant content extraction, leading to incorrect specificity or incomplete answers (FP6, FP7). Similarly, Paper 2 emphasizes that LLMs face difficulties in managing contextual information during conversations, leading to irrelevant or confusing responses when guidance or external knowledge is not effectively integrated.\n\n3. **Dependence on External Information**: RAG systems rely heavily on external retrieved content, which can introduce noise or irrelevant details, impacting the accuracy of generated responses. In CRS, reliance on external knowledge and goals is also crucial; however, LLMs often fail to utilize this information to generate informative responses effectively or cannot adaptively seek additional context when needed.\n\n4. **Failure to Reject Invalid Inputs**: RAG systems struggle with negative rejection (FP5) – when LLMs fail to recognize that they should not answer due to lack of relevant documents.
