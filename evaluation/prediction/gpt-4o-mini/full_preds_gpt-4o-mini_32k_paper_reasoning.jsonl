This contrast allows CD to generate text that emphasizes desirable outputs from the expert LM while minimizing the undesirable characteristics associated with the amateur LM. By selecting the smallest model from the same family as the expert, CD effectively down-weights the weaker behaviors of the expert, resulting in better overall text quality.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly.
