In fiscal year 2024, they repurchased shares for a total of $9.7 billion.\n\nHowever, since the exact average price for repurchased shares to equate this back to equity isn't directly provided, we note that the reduction in shares outstanding contributes to total equity increase because of lower outstanding shares. The repurchased and outstanding drop affects this positively by decreasing total shares but not directly tied in this context for equity accounting, thus concluding:\n\n**The change in shares outstanding contributed positively to the total shareholders' equity change by reflecting decreased shares through repurchases equivalent to a reduction in equity via repurchase costs.**\n\nTo encompass the value, the repurchase of shares worth $9.7 billion played a role in reducing equity aligned with the overall change. However, simply based on totals from the balance sheets:\n\n**Total change in equity: $20.877 billion with a negative share adjustment of -2 million shares towards equity functionality.**", "ground_truth": "The number of shares outstanding decreased from 2,466 million to 2,464 million, a reduction by 2 million shares, primarily due to repurchases. This change, along with an increase in net income retained compared to dividends paid, contributed to a rise in total shareholders' equity from $22,101 million to $42,978 million, with the net income significantly boosting retained earnings."}
