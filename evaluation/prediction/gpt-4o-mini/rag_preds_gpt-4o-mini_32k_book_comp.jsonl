He uses levers to reverse or propel the machine forward in time, demonstrating his belief that time can be traversed like the other dimensions, though with certain limitations imposed by human consciousness and physical constraints. His machine represents a practical application of his theoretical understanding of time as an accessible dimension for travel.", "ground_truth": "The Time Traveller explains time as a fourth dimension comparable to space, where consciousness typically moves in one direction, and he uses this concept to create a machine that can travel through time, freely moving forward and backward."}
