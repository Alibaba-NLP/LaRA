Selecting a smaller model is beneficial because smaller LMs have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors, which helps in identifying failure modes that need to be penalized. This contrast between expert and amateur LMs allows contrastive decoding to produce higher-quality text by emphasizing desirable outputs from the expert model while diminishing the less coherent or repetitive outputs that are more common in smaller models. Thus, the performance improvement stems from leveraging the differences in log-probabilities between the models to guide coherent generation.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

FaR consists of two components: \"Foresee,\" where models predict future events and challenges based on observations, and \"Reflect,\" where they consider which actions would best assist the characters involved. This dual approach enhances LLM performance by enabling them to generate relevant inferences and guide their decision-making.\n\nFaR is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, and Self-Ask, because it combines foresight and reflection, yielding a more comprehensive reasoning approach.

The reasoning behind this improvement is based on the observation that Post-LN layers have a heavier dependency on their residual branches, which amplifies disturbances from small parameter updates and destabilizes training. In contrast, Pre-LN layers have a looser dependency, leading to more stability but often resulting in underutilized model potential. Admin mitigates the strong dependency issue present in Post-LN architectures, facilitating more stable training without compromising performance.", "ground_truth": "The Admin method introduced in paper 1 controls residual dependencies during the initial training stages to ensure stability by aiming for an output change of $O(\\log N)$, which addresses the amplification effect causing instability in Post-LN training.
