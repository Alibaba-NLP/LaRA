Although he dislikes boxing, he learns it thoroughly to counteract these feelings, finding comfort in knowing he can physically handle those who look down on him. This strategy affects him later in life by hardening him into an unattractive mold under domestic unhappiness, leading to his eventual marriage to the first girl who is nice to him.

This internal struggle, characterized by a desire to break free and an opposing pull back toward the familiarity of her past, captures the essence of vertigo—both a temptation to fall and a fear of it.", "ground_truth": "Elena's vertigo stems from the emotional conflict between her desire for control and her overwhelming urge to give in to her feelings of weakness. Her mother’s manipulations and Lucas’s infidelities mirror each other, leading her to feel powerless.

She is attracted to the alien, unexpected, and mysterious beauty that arises without deliberate human design, seeing it as a \"beauty by mistake.\" This perspective links to her appreciation for New York's spontaneous aesthetic and her own painting method, which often includes unintended elements that create surprising beauty. In contrast, Hans' appreciation of the bare, emptied-out Old Church in Amsterdam stems from his personal yearning for liberation from societal and cultural constraints. The church's emptiness and absence of beauty offer him an image of personal freedom from the clutter of the modern intellectual life, which he finds oppressive. This fundamental difference reflects their divergent views on life and art, with Natalia drawn to what forms unintentionally and Hans to what signifies a break from purposeful human creation.", "ground_truth": "Natalia sees beauty as something that can only be experienced when it has been overlooked or betrayed by society, as she realized during her visit to a remote village church.
