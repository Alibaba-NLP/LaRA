The approaches include continued training to integrate parametric knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to improve instruction adherence, and investigations into how well LLMs can retain and utilize knowledge after being enriched with new information. The paper identifies challenges in memorizing and eliciting parametric knowledge, and determining the boundaries of such knowledge for effective fusion with external data.\n\nIn Paper 2, knowledge retention and generalization are addressed through the computation of non-vacuous generalization bounds, highlighting the inherent capability of LLMs to generalize beyond their training data. The paper introduces SubLoRA, a nonlinear compression technique, to achieve extreme levels of model compression necessary for non-vacuous bounds. The bounds demonstrate that larger models are more compressible and generalize better, exploiting parameter sparsity, and suggest that LLMs can act as powerful knowledge compressors able to derive general patterns from training data.\n\nIn summary, Paper 1 emphasizes improving knowledge fusion and testing retention capabilities through model enhancement and continued training, while Paper 2 focuses on achieving theoretical generalization bounds through model compression and understanding how LLMs naturally generalize using parameter efficiency.", "ground_truth": "Paper 1 emphasizes enhancing parametric knowledge through a systematic pipeline for data construction and infusion to improve LLMs' knowledge retention and integration capabilities, while paper 2 focuses on compressibility and generalization bounds, showing that larger LLMs can better compress and generalize beyond training data due to effectively capturing regularities."}
