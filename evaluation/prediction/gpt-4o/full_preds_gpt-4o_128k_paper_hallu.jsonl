The authors emphasize the importance of evaluating the effects of edits, particularly on fairness and safety, and suggest that deeper insights into model behavior and effective control methods can prevent negative impacts. While exact details of the framework are not provided, the discussion suggests a need for careful application and evaluation of knowledge editing techniques.", "ground_truth": "Paper 0 does not propose an ethical framework specifically to ensure that knowledge editing techniques prevent unintended manipulations in LLMs."}

However, it does highlight general ethical concerns related to large language models like MT-NLG, such as the propagation of biases present in training data. If used in predictive policing, MT-NLG could potentially reinforce or exacerbate existing biases in data regarding crime patterns, leading to unfair targeting of certain demographics or communities. Such biases could undermine fair practices and justice, amplifying discriminatory outcomes in law enforcement processes.
