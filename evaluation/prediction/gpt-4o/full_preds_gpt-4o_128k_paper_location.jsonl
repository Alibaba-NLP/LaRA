Unlike MLM, where only a subset of input tokens (typically 15%) are masked for prediction, replaced token detection allows ELECTRA to learn from all input tokens.

As a result, ELECTRA can train faster and achieve better contextual representations using the same amount of compute, significantly outperforming MLM-based models like BERT, especially for small models. Additionally, this method aligns pre-training more closely with downstream fine-tuning tasks since it avoids using artificial [MASK] tokens that are not present during fine-tuning.", "ground_truth": "It allows the model to learn from all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out, making it more computationally efficient."}
