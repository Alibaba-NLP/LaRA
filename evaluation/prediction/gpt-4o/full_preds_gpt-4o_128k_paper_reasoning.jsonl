The dense component quantizes the majority of weights within a contracted range after filtering out the outliers, which allows for more efficient quantization with a smaller range, thus improving precision. Meanwhile, the sparse component stores the outliers and highly sensitive values separately in full precision using sparse storage techniques.

It is typically implemented using lightweight mechanisms such as a Linear Projector or a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

These attacks exploit the inherent text-to-text alignment between raw texts and within-image texts, which can dominate the visual-text alignment, leading to incorrect decision-making and potentially dangerous outcomes in driving scenarios.

Existing models often lack accuracy in detecting and localizing GUI elements, which is crucial for precise task automation.

This protection is primarily due to the dissociative release of the neutral water molecule or transferring an electron or proton across the hydrogen bond, which preserves the pyrrole ring structure. This process competes with fragmentation pathways that would otherwise break the aromatic ring in the bare pyrrole, significantly reducing the fragmentation probability in pyrrole(H2O).", "ground_truth": "The water molecule in pyrrole(H2O) acts as a radiation protection agent by providing alternative relaxation pathways such as the dissociative release of neutral water or the transfer of an electron or proton across the hydrogen bond.

Specifically, incorporating the fictitious good allows defining an extended correspondence in monetary terms, capturing the aggregate monetary balance within the model. This modification explicitly maintains the structure required for both unified gross substitutes—ensuring a consistent substitutability framework—and weighted monotonicity—articulating constraints on weighted totals that retain the required monotonicity with respect to changes in prices. This methodological approach enables seamless integration of these conditions, verifying the conditions in an extended space where constraints on aggregate outcomes naturally emerge.", "ground_truth": "By introducing a fictitious good with a price and associated constants, the extended correspondence incorporates an outside reference point that allows for a comparison across allocations. Lemma 1 shows that if this extended correspondence satisfies unified gross substitutes, then the original correspondence also satisfies both unified gross substitutes and weighted monotonicity, because the sum of weighted quantities accounts for non-price variables, ensuring a consistent measure of substitutability."}

Z-functions have the substitutes property, which means they are antitone with respect to off-diagonal elements; thus, \\(Q_z\\) decreases as the other variables increase. The nonreversing condition ensures that increasing the price cannot decrease excessive supply for all goods, which prevents inversions where the order of solutions is reversed. Together, these properties provide a stable environment that allows the Jacobi sequence to either increase or decrease systematically toward a stable solution, ensuring monotonic convergence under these conditions.", "ground_truth": "The Jacobi sequence is likely to converge because nonreversing $Q$ functions are M-functions or M0-functions, which have properties ensuring that sequences initialized from subsolutions or supersolutions will converge.

The extended vocabulary reduces tokenization length, allowing the model to process up to twice as much information and generate text twice as fast. This enhances the model's proficiency in handling Chinese text compared to the original LLaMA model, which was limited by a smaller set of Chinese tokens and less efficient tokenization.", "ground_truth": "The addition of 20,000 Chinese tokens improves the Chinese LLaMA model's performance by significantly reducing the encoding length, as it allows for direct encoding of Chinese characters rather than tokenizing them into 3-4 byte tokens, which increases both efficiency and semantic understanding.

The paper introduces a parabolic convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, which inherently possesses the decay property of parabolic PDEs, leading to robustness against perturbations of the initial conditions.
