A smaller amateur model is beneficial because it is more prone to errors like repetition and incoherence, which provides a clear contrast to the more accurate predictions of a larger expert model. By emphasizing the differences between these models, contrastive decoding can better highlight and utilize the strengths of the expert model while down-weighting the undesirable tendencies of the amateur model. This improves the overall quality and coherence of the generated text.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models.

Automatic metric evaluations indicate that CD performs better on the MAUVE metric, suggesting it aligns more closely with the token distribution of human-written text. However, CS excels in diversity and coherence metrics. Human evaluations, conducted across different domains, consistently favor CS over CD, highlighting that CS is preferred for producing human-like text in terms of coherence, fluency, and informativeness.

It operates in two parts: \"Foresee,\" where models predict future events based on observations to identify potential challenges, and \"Reflect,\" where models assess which actions can aid characters facing those challenges. This structured approach effectively guides models through implicit inference paths needed to choose correct actions, linking observations to decisions strategically.\n\nThe FaR framework is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods because it explicitly aligns LLMs' reasoning with a future-oriented perspective, encouraging the models to anticipate possible outcomes and critically evaluate how present actions can mitigate identified challenges.

This limitation results in a significant number of generated plans being non-executable, with only about 12% of the plans produced by the best LLM (GPT-4) being executable without errors and reaching their goals. This impacts performance by making the plans appear reasonable yet lead to execution errors when subgoal interactions and domain-specific requirements are not properly handled.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

Although language models have shown improvements in certain capabilities like reasoning and tool use, they still face significant challenges in dynamically adjusting plans based on diverse and concurrent constraints, such as budget, transportation, and user preferences, which are inherent to tasks like travel planning.

Multilingual tuning involves training on data available in all target languages simultaneously, while monolingual tuning involves training separate models for each language.
