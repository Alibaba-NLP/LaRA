The decrease in shares outstanding was partly due to share repurchases, which generally reduce outstanding shares but do not affect total equity since both cash and outstanding shares decrease. Hence, the change in shareholders' equity was driven by factors other than the change in the number of shares outstanding.", "ground_truth": "The number of shares outstanding decreased from 2,466 million to 2,464 million, a reduction by 2 million shares, primarily due to repurchases. This change, along with an increase in net income retained compared to dividends paid, contributed to a rise in total shareholders' equity from $22,101 million to $42,978 million, with the net income significantly boosting retained earnings."}

Consequently, it is not possible to determine the year-over-year change in Corporate debt securities from the data given.\n\nHowever, it is noted that the company holds a range of marketable securities, including debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies, and the financial data indicates an increase in both marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. This could suggest a strategy focused on diversifying investments across different types of instruments, possibly with an aim to balance liquidity, risk, and return.", "ground_truth": "The Corporate debt securities held as marketable securities increased from $3,710 million in 2023 to $7,921 million in 2024, representing an increase of $4,211 million. This suggests that the company might be increasing its investment in corporate debt, possibly to take advantage of higher interest rates or changes in risk assessment."}
