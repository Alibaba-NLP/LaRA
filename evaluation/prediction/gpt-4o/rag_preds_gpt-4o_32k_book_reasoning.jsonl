Hartman sees Christmas as a time for paying bills without money and considers those who celebrate it as fools. His disdain is further fueled by his belief that love and merriment, especially around Christmas, are ridiculous.", "ground_truth": "Hartman, though wealthy, is miserably stingy and disillusioned, seeing Christmas as an unnecessary and foolish expense.

He has watered her, sheltered her, and protected her, and thus, she holds a special significance to him that other roses do not. This personal connection makes his rose unique in all the world, despite the existence of hundreds of similar roses.", "ground_truth": "Stellar boy understands that his rose is unique because it is the one he has cared for and formed a bond with—he has watered it, protected it, and listened to it.

{"type": "novelette_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "The Little Prince.txt", "context_order": "full", "question": "Why does the little prince insist on a drawing of a sheep even after rejecting several attempts from the narrator?", "prediction": "The little prince insists on a drawing of a sheep because he wants one that matches his requirements—a sheep that is not sickly, not a ram with horns, and one that will live a long time. When the narrator, out of frustration, draws a box and says the sheep is inside, the little prince is satisfied because it allows him to imagine the sheep just as he desires.", "ground_truth": "The little prince rejects the first drawings because one sheep is too sickly, another is a ram, and the last one is too old. Ultimately, what he seeks isn't a perfect physical representation of a sheep but rather something imaginative and practical. Once the narrator draws a box, saying the sheep is inside, the little prince is satisfied because it allows him to project his own imagination onto the drawing, fitting his need for a small sheep for his planet."}

In draughts, the victory, with equal players, is determined by intellectual exertion rather than mere concentration, making it a more effective exercise for the reflective intellect.", "ground_truth": "The narrator concludes that draughts better exercises the intellect because, unlike chess where attention is heavily taxed due to the complexity of piece movements, draughts relies on simple, limited moves. This simplicity, allowing for fewer oversights, shifts the focus to acumen and intellectual engagement with the opponent's strategy, whereas chess often rewards sheer concentration."}

Despite the windows being fastened from within with stout nails, Verne suggests the \"apparent impossibilities\" of escaping through these windows need to be reevaluated, as no other viable escape route existed.", "ground_truth": "Verne reasons that since both windows were found fastened from the inside, the police wrongly concluded that no one could have exited through them. However, Verne discovers a cleverly concealed spring mechanism and a broken nail at one window, indicating that the window could close and appear undisturbed after someone exited, thus revealing it as the murderer's escape route."}

Descriptions of the voice as \"harsh rather than shrill\" and \"quick and unequal\" suggested it didn't belong to any human familiar to the witnesses, leading Verne to suspect a non-human presence involved in the crimes.", "ground_truth": "Verne notes that the strength required to tear out tresses of hair and thrust a body up the chimney, along with the bizarre nature of the injuries and the unusual hand impressions on the victim's throat, indicate the actions of a non-human. Additionally, the voice heard by witnesses was not comprehensible, adding to the strangeness of the scene. These factors combined led him to reason that the culprit was not human but an animal, specifically an Ourang-Outang."}

He determines that the murderers were material beings who had to physically escape, and after ruling out the doors and chimneys, he focuses on the windows. Both windows appeared securely fastened from the inside, which would make escape seem impossible. However, Verne finds a hidden spring mechanism on the sashes, allowing them to be closed from outside without securing the nail. He concludes that the assassins escaped through the window with the hidden spring because it could be reclosed from outside, unlike the nail that couldn't be replaced from outside.", "ground_truth": "Verne concludes that since both doors were locked with the keys inside, and the chimneys were too narrow, the only possible mode of egress was through the window. By investigating further, he finds a hidden spring that could allow the window to appear locked from the inside after the escape, proving that the killers did indeed flee through the window."}

He questions whether it was a sin to kill the fish for survival, pride, and due to his identity as a fisherman. Despite his love and respect for the fish, and recognizing its nobility and dignity, he feels remorse for having to kill it, while understanding the necessity to do so in order to feed himself and others.", "ground_truth": "Guillermo feels conflicted because he both loves and respects the fish for its beauty, strength, and nobility.
