Choosing a smaller model as the amateur is beneficial because smaller models are more prone to failure modes, such as short, repetitive, and incoherent outputs. These failure modes are more common under smaller LMs, so contrasting the expert LM's outputs against the amateur LM's outputs helps to emphasize the desirable outputs of the expert LM while diminishing these undesirable tendencies. This approach exploits the differences in modeling capacity between large (expert) and small (amateur) models to enhance the quality and coherence of the generated text.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

This approach significantly reduces the computation required compared to methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting, which require numerous inference calls (10-40 times more). The reasoning improvement comes from grounding the reasoning structure in atomic reasoning modules, allowing it to cover diverse perspectives and not miss key knowledge, making it more effective than simply using CoT or relying on perfect prior knowledge about which reasoning module to use.", "ground_truth": "SELF-DISCOVER improves task performance efficiently by composing reasoning structures based on atomic reasoning modules, which leverage various cognitive strategies in a structured manner. This modular integration allows it to outperform more inference-heavy methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting with substantially fewer inference calls, as it requires only three initial meta-prompt steps and applies a universal reasoning structure consistently.

The Foresee component prompts models to predict potential future events and challenges based on observations, effectively guiding the reasoning with heuristics. The Reflect component then encourages models to assess which actions would be most beneficial in addressing these challenges, refining the action choices through a reasoning process akin to path pruning in the A* algorithm.\n\nFaR is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods because it significantly boosts the accuracy of models like GPT-4 from 50% to 71%, outperforming strategies such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, and Self-Ask. This improvement is due to FaR's ability to guide models in making more relevant inferences by predicting and reflecting on future scenarios, thus overcoming the main challenge of identifying correct evidence in T4D. Both components of FaR are crucial, as ablation studies showed performance drops when either component is omitted. However, FaR's effectiveness is sensitive to the quality of foresight provided, as inaccurate foresight can degrade performance.", "ground_truth": "The FaR framework helps LLMs tackle T4D's challenges by structuring reasoning through future event prediction (Foresee) and action-oriented reflection (Reflect), thus guiding the model to make appropriate inferences and actions.

This limitation significantly impacts their performance, making them unreliable for generating correct plans autonomously.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

This assumption states that the $K$ indices of active devices in each iteration are selected independently and with replacement from a distribution $p_{k}$. This selection method allows the convergence analysis to accommodate partial device participation. For these assumptions to hold, the selection of devices must be random and follow the specified probability distribution, which ensures that each device's contribution is balanced over time.

This differs from traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) methods that rely on retrieving pseudo-relevant documents to extract new query terms. The advantage of query2doc is that it doesn't require retrieving good initial documents and can substantially improve retrieval performance without model fine-tuning. This method is particularly effective for hard queries and does not need changes in training pipelines or architectures, making it versatile and easier to implement.", "ground_truth": "The query2doc method differs from traditional pseudo-relevance feedback by generating pseudo-documents using LLMs instead of relying on feedback signals from the top-k documents obtained in initial retrieval steps.

This step-by-step breakdown tends to produce a more comprehensive set of query expansion terms compared to other prompt types.

This approach contrasts with a simple thresholding method, which only considers direct word similarities and performs worse with higher-dimensional embeddings due to the curse of dimensionality.

The experiments demonstrated that LLMs are no better at verifying solutions than they are at generating them, and self-critiquing often results in passing over correct solutions, leading to worse outcomes. Additionally, without being trained on \"corrections data,\" there's no reason to believe that LLMs' critiques would be relevant or correct.", "ground_truth": "The authors criticize this belief because LLMs cannot effectively verify their own plans; without training on 'corrections data,' there's no guarantee their critiques will be relevant or correct.

The previously observed improvements in self-correction were attributed to the use of oracle labels, and these improvements vanish when such labels are unavailable. Additionally, the sub-optimal design of prompts for generating initial responses further contributes to the poor performance, as self-correction only appears effective when rectifying these initially flawed responses.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that LLMs cannot effectively judge the correctness of their reasoning, leading to a higher likelihood of altering correct answers to incorrect ones rather than fixing mistakes. Additionally, if a model is initially well-aligned with a well-designed prompt, further feedback may skew responses away from optimal, thus lowering performance instead of improving it."}

Unlike Pre-LN, which has a balanced dependency on residual branches and prior layers, Post-LN has a heavier dependency on its residual branch, causing training instability due to amplification of parameter perturbations. Admin addresses this by regularizing model behavior at initialization, minimizing the heavy dependency in the early stages, and allowing full potential exploitation in the later stages. This results in faster convergence, increased stability, and better overall performance without additional hyper-parameters.", "ground_truth": "The Admin method introduced in paper 1 controls residual dependencies during the initial training stages to ensure stability by aiming for an output change of $O(\\log N)$, which addresses the amplification effect causing instability in Post-LN training. This method is inspired by the understanding that Post-LN's strong layer dependency amplifies fluctuations more than Pre-LN, thus Admin balances these dependencies early on to stabilize the training while retaining full model potential in later stages."}
