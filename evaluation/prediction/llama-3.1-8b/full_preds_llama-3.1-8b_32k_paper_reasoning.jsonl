The amateur LM is the smaller LM, and its choice is crucial because it emphasizes the failure modes of the expert LM, which are more prevalent in smaller LMs. Choosing a smaller amateur LM is beneficial because it allows the contrastive decoding method to downweight undesirable patterns (e.g., repetition, topic drift) more effectively. A smaller amateur LM is more prone to errors, which helps to highlight the good behaviors of the larger expert LM.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

This is achieved through a self-discovery process that selects, adapts, and implements a reasoning structure for each task, allowing models to follow the structure to arrive at a final answer.

FaR consists of two components: Foresee, which prompts models to extrapolate potential future events from given observations, and Reflect, which prompts models to reflect on actionable steps that would best serve humans in real-time contexts. By providing LLMs with a structured reasoning paradigm, FaR enables them to reason about future challenges and potential actions, which is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods because it combines future prediction and pruning by action-aware reflection.", "ground_truth": "The FaR framework helps LLMs tackle T4D's challenges by structuring reasoning through future event prediction (Foresee) and action-oriented reflection (Reflect), thus guiding the model to make appropriate inferences and actions.

To meet this condition, a transformation is proposed, where $\\widetilde{F}_{k}(\\mathbf{w})=p_{k} N F_{k}(\\mathbf{w})$ is used, and the global objective becomes a simple average of all scaled local objectives.

This differs from traditional pseudo-relevance feedback methods, which rely on retrieving a good set of pseudo-relevant documents to expand queries. The advantage of query2doc is that it leverages the generative abilities of LLMs to provide relevant information that can aid in query disambiguation and guide retrievers, without relying on the quality of the initial retrieval results.", "ground_truth": "The query2doc method differs from traditional pseudo-relevance feedback by generating pseudo-documents using LLMs instead of relying on feedback signals from the top-k documents obtained in initial retrieval steps. This approach does not depend on the quality of initial retrieval results, which are often noisy, and uses cutting-edge LLMs to produce documents likely containing relevant terms, improving the robustness of query expansion."}

A neighborhood size of 3 allows the model to consider a sufficient number of neighboring items to capture contextual information, while avoiding the redundancy and noise that can occur with larger neighborhood sizes.", "ground_truth": "The choice of a neighborhood size of 3 is particularly effective because it provides a balanced amount of comparative information by considering a manageable number of neighboring items both above and below the target item. This size allows the model to capture relevant context without being overwhelmed by too much distant information, leading to a significant improvement in MRR by around 5%, which suggests an optimal balance between relevance and contextual influence."}

Each PE owns a subset of nz cells of the original grid, extended by 8 extra cells, ensuring that any cell in the original grid has 4 neighbors below and 4 neighbors above.

They also propose that if the initial response is already optimal, adding feedback can have a negative effect, and that the model may be more likely to modify a correct answer to an incorrect one than to revise an incorrect answer to a correct one.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that LLMs cannot effectively judge the correctness of their reasoning, leading to a higher likelihood of altering correct answers to incorrect ones rather than fixing mistakes.

The verifier LLM generates a significant number of false positives, which can be detrimental to the overall system's reliability.\n2. The LLM verifier's performance is comparable to a generator LLM without backprompting.\n3. The amount of feedback provided to the LLM seems to have minimal influence on its performance improvement.\n\nThese reasons suggest that the core issue lies in the LLM's binary verification capabilities rather than the granularity of feedback.", "ground_truth": "The authors doubt the reliability of using LLMs as self-critiquing systems for planning tasks because the verifier LLM in their study frequently produces false positives, indicating plans are valid when they are not.

This is achieved by adaptively initializing the model to ensure an O(log N) output change, which stabilizes training and allows the model to capture deeper dependencies once it becomes stable. The reasoning behind this improvement is that Pre-LN restricts the network from being too deep, limiting its potential, while Post-LN's heavy dependency on residual branches amplifies small parameter perturbations and results in significant disturbances in the model output, leading to unstable training.", "ground_truth": "The Admin method introduced in paper 1 controls residual dependencies during the initial training stages to ensure stability by aiming for an output change of $O(\\log N)$, which addresses the amplification effect causing instability in Post-LN training. This method is inspired by the understanding that Post-LN's strong layer dependency amplifies fluctuations more than Pre-LN, thus Admin balances these dependencies early on to stabilize the training while retaining full model potential in later stages."}
