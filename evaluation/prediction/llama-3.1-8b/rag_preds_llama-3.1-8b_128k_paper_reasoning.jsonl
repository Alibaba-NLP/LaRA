This approach aims to address safety concerns by:\n\n* Evaluating not just the accuracy of the agent's output but also its actions and decisions\n* Recognizing that the same action in different contexts can lead to vastly different consequences\n* Fostering a triadic relationship involving humans, machines, and the environment to ensure safe agent operations.\n\nBy prioritizing behavioral safety, the authors aim to mitigate risks associated with scientific agents, such as environmental hazards, individual harm, misuse of data, and unexpected ethical dilemmas.", "ground_truth": "The rationale for emphasizing behavioral safety over output safety is due to the significance of evaluating not just the accuracy of scientific agents' outputs but also their actions and decisions, which can have varying consequences in different contexts. This approach helps address safety concerns by ensuring that the agents' operations align with ethical and safe standards, taking into account the broader implications of their activities, thus reducing the risk of harmful outcomes in the scientific domain."}

However, it does mention that RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs, but it does not specify the challenges in retrieving relevant documents. \n\nInstead, the paper presents 7 failure points that occur when engineering a RAG system, which include: \n\n1. No metrics for query rewriting\n2. Document re-ranking\n3. Effective content summarisation\n4. Evaluating factual accuracy\n5. Failure of query-artifact matching strategy\n6.
