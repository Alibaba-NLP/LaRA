Debt: The crop-lien system made it difficult for tenants to emerge from debt, as they were forced to mortgage their crops and pay rent in advance.\n2. Limited access to credit: The merchant system, dominated by white landlords, controlled access to credit, making it difficult for tenants to access loans or investment.\n3. Economic exploitation: Landlords exploited tenants by paying them low wages, taking advantage of their limited education and skills.\n4. Racism and classism: The society was characterized by racism and classism, with white landowners holding power and privilege over black tenants.\n\nThese obstacles reflected broader social issues, including:\n\n1. The perpetuation of slavery and debt peonage, which limited the economic opportunities of black people.\n2. The lack of access to education and credit, which hindered their ability to improve their economic circumstances.\n3.

The black population is heavily reliant on agriculture, which is controlled by white landowners who use debt peonage to maintain their power. The black population has limited access to education and economic opportunities, and the majority are renters or tenant farmers, struggling to survive. The system of debt peonage and the power dynamics between black and white reinforce racism and limit the economic and social mobility of black people. The author argues that the black people are not lazy or shiftless, but are trapped in a system of economic exploitation and racism, which must be addressed through education, self-empowerment, and collective action.", "ground_truth": "In the context discussed, educational deprivation and economic exploitation together form a cycle that hinders black progress, as political disfranchisement limits access to resources that could break this cycle, causing a prevalence of poverty and reduced opportunities."}

Washington's approach?", "prediction": "Du Bois argues that education is a crucial factor in African American progress, but its realization is hindered by the legacy of slavery and racism. After Emancipation, the economic and social difficulties faced by African Americans, including debt, poverty, and lack of access to education, hindered their ability to achieve their full potential. In contrast, Booker T. Washington's approach to education focuses on vocational training and manual labor, which Du Bois believes ultimately limits African Americans to a life of servitude and poverty.\n\nDu Bois advocates for a more inclusive and liberal approach to education, which values the intellectual and cultural achievements of African Americans. He believes that this approach will allow African Americans to develop their full potential and to participate more fully in American society. Ultimately, Du Bois sees education as a key factor in achieving African American progress and self-determination, but he also recognizes that it must be tempered by a recognition of the historical and ongoing injustices faced by African Americans.", "ground_truth": "Du Bois highlights the necessity of higher education to solve deep-seated racial inequalities and train black leaders, while Booker T.

He notes that in a given situation, one can make only one decision, and there is no room for comparison or repetition. This is echoed in his view that human life occurs only once and that the history of the Czechs will not be repeated.\n\nTereza's reflection, on the other hand, is characterized by her desire to experience a state of idyllic happiness, free from conflicts and hair-raising scenes. She idealizes the love between man and dog, which she believes is idyllic and repetitive. Her relationship with Lucas, however, is marked by infidelity and hurt, but she argues that this love is inferior to the idyllic love between man and dog.\n\nIn contrast, Tomas's views on love and infidelity emphasize the importance of loyalty, commitment, and fidelity. He recognizes that infidelity can have devastating consequences, but he also acknowledges that people are flawed and that relationships involve a degree of pain and sacrifice.\n\nTomas's rejection of the \"es muss sein\" (it must be so) mentality, which he associates with a life of imposed duty and expectation, is a reflection of his desire for autonomy and freedom. He recognizes that people must make their own choices and live with the consequences, rather than following a predetermined path.\n\nIn summary, Tomas's and Tereza's views on the weight of actions and experiences differ in their emphasis on the importance of loyalty, commitment, and fidelity (Tomas) versus the idealization of idyllic happiness and repetitive experiences (Tereza).", "ground_truth": "Tomas views love and sexuality as separate and pursues infidelities lightly, seeking freedom from emotional weight, whereas Tereza seeks a unique and binding connection through fidelity, viewing infidelities as a betrayal that threaten the foundation of her relationship with Tomas."}

Tereza's obsession with Tomas, who represents the ideal love that she can never attain, serves as a constant reminder of her own limitations and the \"I\" that drives her actions. Her desire to follow Tomas, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness, is a manifestation of \"Es muss sein!\" \n2. Tereza's inability to accept Tomas's rejection of her and her need to constantly re-evaluate her own identity and purpose reflect the way \"Es muss sein!\" forces her to confront her own flaws and limitations. \n3. The fact that Tomas himself is driven by his own \"I\" and must make choices that ultimately lead to his own demise illustrates the deterministic nature of \"Es muss sein!\" and the way it shapes individual lives. \n\nIn both texts, \"Es muss sein!\" is a constant force that drives characters to make choices that are ultimately shaped by their own \"I\" and the societal expectations placed upon them. This theme serves as a commentary on the human condition and the nature of free will, highlighting the tension between individual desire and the deterministic forces that shape our lives.", "ground_truth": "Tereza's feelings of inadequacy and her perception of Tomas's infidelities highlight the weighty, almost inescapable mandate of 'Es muss sein!' as a representation of her struggles with identity and love, while Tomas's reflections on his choices and his professional sacrifices depict 'Es muss sein!' as an internal imperative that drives his existential decisions and his eventual search for a lighter, more liberated existence."}

Initially, she sees the concentration camp as a place where people are trapped and oppressed, but as she reflects on her own experiences, she comes to realize that the true concentration camp is the mental and emotional space she creates for herself through her relationships with others, particularly her lover Lucas. This realization is evident in her observation that \"His strength is called goodness, Hans would never give Natalia orders\" and her recognition that \"Man is a parasite on the cow as the tapeworm is on man.\" This new perspective highlights the ways in which Tereza's perception of a concentration camp metaphor is not just about external oppression but also about internalized trauma and disconnection.\n\nIn the context of the Czech political situation, Tereza's evolving perception of a concentration camp metaphor relates to the reality of the country's occupation and repression. The concentration camp metaphor serves as a powerful symbol for the ways in which the Czech people were forced to live in a state of constant surveillance and fear, with their lives heavily controlled by the oppressive regime. As Tereza's perception of the metaphor evolves, it also reflects the ways in which the Czech people were forced to adapt and survive in this oppressive environment, often at the cost of their own autonomy and individuality. Ultimately, Tereza's metaphor serves as a powerful critique of the ways in which the Czech people were treated as if they were in a concentration camp, and the ways in which they were forced to internalize this trauma and disconnection.", "ground_truth": "Tereza initially uses the 'concentration camp' metaphor to describe the obliteration of privacy in her family life, later extending it to the Czech political situation, drawing parallels between her loss of personal space and the oppressive regime, highlighted by both the secret police activities and her past encounters with censorship and monitoring."}
