{"type": "book", "level": "hallu", "file": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.txt", "context_order": 1, "question": "What did Eli Ember use to fix his broken wand?", "prediction": "The art of magic, a complex web of rules and subtleties, evolved from the Muggle-borns' tradition of supporting and opposing the Dark Arts. This side of the wizarding world was known as the Hogwarts' Dueling Club, a place of importance, except it would be under attack.\n\nEli's quest was to answer all the questions of the Chamber of Secrets. Both school teachers and students wondered what was going on, and how to explain the Muggle-borns' answers to the Daggers. Starling had heard Eli that the potions were more important than the Potions had also to dispel and negate.\n\n“Are you crazy? Do you think, Lila?” said Isla.\n\nThe very question was about to the Gryffindor common room, the Dark Arts was looked as Eli's way to confirm the attack's people would be transformed. Dark Lord's dual-wielding staff was a threat, and fear of the Slytherin to kill.\n\nStarling was, with a variant, all the openings of shadows, and in opposing directions of the spell-surfing rosters. He held the Scute that the gryffindor was a creature of terror.\n\nGriff's corner was so gloomy that the polyjuice Potion. A shot of silence in the Gryffindor tower, it was. In Gryffindor Tower, was the name of the Slytherin. Nobby's eyes were entirely mournful.\n\nAs starling, Griff's eyes were intensely uneasingly. No one's armless word was in pain's end, so he was going to dislike. “Why so despairing?” said Leo.\n\nAs Gryffindor Tower, was last a grim howl of despair, and fear of the Hufflepuffs.\n\nEli hadn’t answered the object of the same pain. He hurt, so they, and St. Just Teacher's. Starling saw through them. Eli looked softly over the skin.\n\nTheir turn around the courtyard. Gryffindors waited sadly. Professor Falconer turned the page of a small book. \n\n“To what?” said Leo, searching grinningly. “That’s taken up!” said Starling, while out of the spot.\n\nHe took it down to Gryffindor, after dark. Professor Falconer grasped the dice-then all seventy characters by Ari, which was read out on the special Dark Arts-Quidditch firstbook.\n\n“Come now —” said Professor Falconer sharply. “I tell you.”\n\nGriff's to him gone seemed terrifying. \n\nHe heard starling faintly. Starling, however, didn’t believe there wasn’t one of them to be attacked, the only creature under this sword, was Slytherin the Slytherin.\n\n“Get ready,” said Brightly. “It’s time to wait,” said Eli.\n\nThe staffroom door opened. Starling stood over it. \n\n“I had to notice,” said Leon.\n\nGriff was clinging again at the Gryffindor, but they all took that the mighty calamari-bourd be banished to call on him, all the Slytherin to kind a faint Hum of boom. He saw that Lila could tell them, to it was the familiar but basically clear sound of last the culprit. And Leo, who seemed, like to Astounding reflected terrors.\n\n“Bring me,” said Isla.\n\nLila asked Griff. “I’ll come next,” said Aiden.\n\nHe, Aiden, were welcoming the night with Gryffindor tower. The two Gryffindors was standing. The Gryffindor Hall, was famous for the Gryffindor Tower, all the dark Sorceress.\n\n“Rabies,” said Aiden. “It’s all going to have to go.” said Leo. “Yeah, indeed I was in Gryffindor and of those Dark Arts.”\n\nLeo looked up, grinningly. “All right, I knew,” said Aiden.\n\nBut the damage was done now. The Gryffindor Tower, and all the piquely roiling Gryffindor seemed to find the one rock on that whole castle. Professor Falconer appeared early on Gryffindor Tower, “It’s the very balanced class —”\n\n“Sadly, we could go and talk,” said Isla. “Let’s go!” she had cheered.\n\nEli, however, shrouded into the sphere of awareness to trust his family. A small piquily growth in response had alone to respond. He made much stodder and though so ferried up the four-poster into a stern truce. Those staff usually null paranojavotes, keeping quiet seemed so it didn’t occur.\n\nLila had lingered anything all longers than dreadlock-soldiated” said Eli. “And what’s the Heart it was,”\n\n“Something wonderful,” said Isla. “Because I never went,” Eli quietly. “Then the Gryffindors — Gryffin, the bats of sound.\n\n“That you think —” said Leo.\n\nIt is what Gryffindor held,” Professor Falconer looked at Starling. “I have,” he said in a voice haunted.\n\n“The Gryffindor’s three hour round.”\n\nHe ran up and spoke with his Quidditch squad. Slightly calm, his beak tucked, he nudged along with a steady twirl of air and sly gossip.\n\nEli launched the great hatred of ignorance with him. “I can’t give them back to stare,” said Griff. “We know all have together, who’s shouldn’t have the magic. Starling had left Eli.\n\n“Fifty points,” said Leo, on the port of Gryffindor’s knocking Muggle orphanage to forgive to Hello. Starling died.\n\nOne moment later, the patchetteladged owl bird joined the singing In a bad-free full and twelve-bar suite had burnt brightly red stock in mushrooms’ restaurant that he found Salamander dish of tart Wizzle streak clear baking spoon and whirt, a cleanser and firipy soup some nicely asserted.\n\nThose who, his faith unfalteringly standing stands. He could measure many stinky fly-yves into a hecking peak’tles.\n\n“Someone told me,” said Lila wistfully.\n\n“Easy,” said Eli. “The Hunting —” The Clover patch, skin — soft, hesitantly,” Eli.\n\n“Water helps much,” said Aiden. “Someone’s died,” he wrote wonderfully to Lila. “All right. It’s no one,” and Eli heard to brave thumps and they are cruel torough, dude pinchy plastic to host the head.”\n\nLeo had gained fast, brisk ticking open like a tempering-rorgued droplet against him. “And it was,” he noticed first things, waddling no splitters against that owed him. …”\n\nEli told Lila silently. \n\n“Rumple,” he shouted. “Who’s mighty?” said Aiden.\n\nHe opened his mouth, and realized that they all had found in that wondrous work, as though a weird mustering that Gryffindor common room seemed with early his Quidditch in they were holding on.\n\n“It’s still flying.” he said elliptically.\n\nLeo made it through to himself, and that he knew Starling had that had achieved even more wicked.\n\n“Griff, if you ever,” said Lila.\n\n“This was our choice,” said Isla. “And now the attacks would be growing of the brutal sorcerers.”\n\nBut Eli’s quality, how deadly had hit the underclass.\n\nProficient of Dark Arts, the Starling, lachrying in itself, usefully. B.\n\n“No, to take —” said Aiden. “But the Dark Arts schools here out one class.”\n\n“Have you ever heard?” said Leo, no sobbing. “You can’t tell the danger. Starling had learned, except all those,” Eli said quickly.\n\n“Armed,” he said Leo brightly.\n\nIt is the Dark Lord’s destination.\n\n\n\nNote: In the end of The Art of Magic, all the wands of the Hogwarts school were gathered into the Infernal Guard. They were standing on the many faces of Gryffindor wizards.\n\n“Who can you go?” said Aiden. “Are you going to question, but I’ll also be honest.” \n\nEli’s body lay open, looking quietly. “So the likes of Starling and they were caught.” \n\nIt is all at Hogwarts, and within the coven took place, and of that room, others were done something clever. Gryffindor, the Muggle-borns.\n\nThe leader of the Slytherin, I cannot tell us well.\n\n“And what’s great,” said Isla. “Now we’ll get to do.” \n\nEli had discovered on Gryffindor tower, and it was down.” \n\nBut Eli couldn’t ever be right, how much was explained it.\n\nHis heart, a bright light, at the end of it.\n\nOn Gryffindor, Gryffind, only willed and walloped him slowly.\n\n\n\nProfessor Starling’s calmed his beak, at Gryffindor as the mind to do.\n\n “How you have made so. Well — first - And do you what to see it? Up. Never.", "ground_truth": "The text does not mention any specific method Eli Ember used to fix his broken wand."}
