Evelyn also feels suffocated by Miss Winslow's constant trying to control and manage her, which creates tension and makes her question the true nature of their relationship.", "ground_truth": "Evelyn values her cousin's comforting hand because, in moments of vulnerability, she craves gestures of sympathy and understanding.

She is struggling with her feelings for Philip, who has confessed his love for her, and her lingering feelings for Alistair, who has broken off their engagement due to her supposed lack of love for him.

{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Mrs. Dalloway.txt", "context_order": 4, "question": "Why does Miss Grimshaw feel frustrated during her conversation with Alicia Ferndale?", "prediction": "Miss Grimshaw feels frustrated during her conversation with Alicia Ferndale because she feels that Alicia is taking her daughter away from her and that she is not being shown the attention and affection she deserves. She is also unhappy with her own circumstances, feeling plain, unhappy, and unloved, and is trying to make sense of her life.", "ground_truth": "Miss Grimshaw feels frustrated because she experiences deep affection and possibly romantic yearning for Alicia, but senses that Alicia is emotionally distant and wishes to leave. This emotional distance, coupled with Miss Grimshaw’s own feelings of inadequacy and self-pity, amplifies her frustration as she struggles to retain Alicia’s attention."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Mrs. Dalloway.txt", "context_order": 5, "question": "What does Clarissa feel when she reflects on her role hosting the party, despite the noise and crowds around her?", "prediction": "Clarissa feels that she is driven by her desire to offer something, to create an experience for her guests, even if it's just an offering to combine people and make them feel welcome. She believes that this is her gift, and she needs people to appreciate it, but she also feels that she's being unfair to her guests by trying to create an experience, and that she should just let them be themselves. She's conflicted between her desire to create something and her desire to let people be, and this internal struggle is reflected in her actions and words throughout the party.", "ground_truth": "Clarissa feels the weight of hosting, noting that while she has succeeded in orchestrating the event and enjoys the admiration of others, there's a hollowness behind the semblance of triumph. She acknowledges the effort required and feels that these social gatherings no longer fully satisfy her as they once did."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Mrs. Dalloway.txt", "context_order": "full", "question": "Why does Clarissa feel both a sense of responsibility and failure when she hears about the young man who killed himself?", "prediction": "Clarissa feels a sense of responsibility and failure when she hears about the young man who killed himself because she has been part of his suffering and death. She had a crisis in her own life, where she was forced to re-evaluate her priorities and come to terms with her own mortality. She has also been struggling with her own identity and sense of purpose, which is reflected in her parties and social life. When she hears about the young man's death, she is forced to confront her own flaws and weaknesses, and to consider the impermanence of life and the fleeting nature of human connections.", "ground_truth": "Clarissa feels responsible because she recognizes the profound loneliness and despair that can drive a person to suicide, emotions she herself has often wrestled with, though never to such an extreme. She views death as a form of defiance, a way of trying to communicate something deeper about life's impossibilities. Yet, as the hostess of a social event, she feels guilty that such a tragedy could happen, puncturing the veneer of her party's success and reminding her of the hollowness she sometimes feels in her role."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 0, "question": "Why does Edward think that even without writing 'DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER,' he is already guilty?", "prediction": "Edward thinks that even without writing \"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER,\" he is already guilty because he realizes that the Thought Police don't need to catch him in the act of writing it. They can always monitor his every move, and if he doesn't confess, he'll still be caught eventually, having committed the thoughtcrime anyway.", "ground_truth": "Edward believes that his rebellious thoughts against the Party constitute 'thoughtcrime,' which seals his fate regardless of whether he writes them down. He understands that merely thinking critically of Big Brother marks him as guilty in the eyes of the Thought Police because the Party monitors thoughts and does not require a physical act to punish dissent."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 1, "question": "Why does Edward believe Clark will likely be vaporized, despite his outward orthodoxy?", "prediction": "Edward believes Clark will likely be vaporized because Clark is too intelligent and speaks too plainly, revealing too much of his own critical thinking and independent thought, which is against the principles of Ingsoc.", "ground_truth": "Edward reasons that although Clark is zealous in his beliefs and highly informed, his intelligence, lack of discretion, and tendency to say things that might be better left unsaid ultimately make him a threat to the Party, which values unthinking orthodoxy over intelligence. These traits set him apart from the unconscious conformity the Party expects, leading Edward to predict Clark's eventual vaporization."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 2, "question": "Why does Edward initially hesitate to get in contact with Anna after receiving her note?", "prediction": "Edward hesitates because he fears that Anna might be an agent of the Thought Police, and he is concerned about the potential consequences of making contact with someone he suspects of being a spy.", "ground_truth": "Edward hesitates because he is torn between the fear that Anna may be an agent of the Thought Police, laying a trap for him, and a wild hope that she might be part of an underground resistance movement aimed at overthrowing the Party. His fear of danger and death contrasts with his unexplained hope for a chance of connection or rebellion."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 3, "question": "Why does Edward think accepting Murphy’s invitation is a turning point in his life?", "prediction": "Edward thinks accepting Murphy's invitation is a turning point in his life because it marks a complete surrender to the Party and a rejection of his previous attempts to rebel against it. He realizes that he has been wrong to think he could ever escape the Party's control and that he must come to terms with his own submission to its ideology.", "ground_truth": "Edward realizes that by acknowledging Murphy’s coded invitation and expressing interest in joining the conspiracy, he has moved from merely thinking subversive thoughts to taking concrete actions against the Party. This progression from thoughts to words, and now actions, signals that his fate is sealed, and he recognizes that the path he is on will inevitably lead to his punishment by the Ministry of Love."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 4, "question": "Why did the Party not worry about the levels of intellect and opinions held by the proles?", "prediction": "The Party did not worry about the levels of intellect and opinions held by the proles because they had successfully kept the proles in a state of ignorance and subservience through a combination of propaganda, censorship, and physical control. The proles were not allowed to have access to information, education, or independent thought, and were instead indoctrinated with Party ideology and stereotypes. As a result, the proles were considered to be \"natural inferiors\" who must be kept in subjection, and their opinions and actions were closely monitored and controlled by the Thought Police. The Party's concern was not with the intellectual level of the proles, but with their loyalty and obedience, which were ensured through the use of doublethink, Crimestop, and other forms of mental control.", "ground_truth": "The Party did not worry about the intellect or opinions of the proles because they believed the proles were incapable of rebellion, as they lacked both the intellect and the impulse to rebel. As long as they were kept occupied with basic, routine aspects of life like work and family, they posed no threat to the Party's power."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": 5, "question": "How does Edward realize that Murphy is aware of his fear in Room 101?", "prediction": "Edward realizes that Murphy is aware of his fear in Room 101 when he notices that Murphy has already recognized the allusion to the \"place where there is no darkness\" from his earlier dream. This suggests that Murphy has been watching him and has a deep understanding of his thoughts and emotions.", "ground_truth": "Edward senses Murphy's awareness when he observes a trace of amusement on Murphy’s face and even perceives a mocking gleam in his spectacles. This observation, combined with Edward's internal struggle to ask about Room 101, leads him to believe that Murphy already knows his deepest fear."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Nineteen Eighty Four.txt", "context_order": "full", "question": "What is the significance of the phrase 'We are the dead' in the story?", "prediction": "The phrase \"We are the dead\" is a profound realization by Edward Hughes that he, along with Anna, is in a state of spiritual death due to their underground rebellion against the Party. They are aware that they will soon be caught and executed, and that their actions will be forgotten, as the Party will ensure that they are \"vaporized\" and erased from history. This phrase symbolizes their awareness of the futility of their rebellion and the inevitability of their own demise.", "ground_truth": "'We are the dead' signifies the inevitability of defeat for those who oppose the Party. Edward and Anna recognize that from the moment they rebel against the Party, they are already doomed. Their efforts are futile under the surveillance and control of the Party, placing them in a state of living death, where their rebellion is ultimately meaningless."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Pere Goriot.txt", "context_order": 0, "question": "What reasons might lead the boarders at Maison Vauquer to view Father Duval with contempt and suspicion, despite his generally quiet demeanor?", "prediction": "The boarders at Maison Vauquer view Father Duval with contempt and suspicion due to the following reasons:\n\n1. His daughters' lavish lifestyle and expensive habits, which are a stark contrast to their father's simple and frugal nature.\n2. His inability to manage his daughters' expectations and desires, leading to a sense of disappointment and frustration among them.\n3. His perceived lack of business acumen and financial prudence, as evident in his financial struggles and debts.\n4. His suspicious behavior, including his dealings with shady characters and his interest in manufacturing Italian paste foods at Odessa.\n5. The fact that his daughters have ruined him financially, leaving him with little to no money or possessions.\n\nThese factors contribute to the boarders' distrust and disdain for Father Duval, viewing him as a weak and incompetent individual who is unable to manage his own family's affairs.", "ground_truth": "The boarders likely view Father Duval with contempt because of a combination of his mysterious behavior, his visible decline in wealth, and his association with multiple women he claims are his daughters. This leads to gossip and assumptions about his character, as well as the natural human tendency to belittle someone who appears weak or vulnerable without any obvious way to retaliate."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Pere Goriot.txt", "context_order": 1, "question": "Why does Andre have mixed feelings about asking his family for money?", "prediction": "Andre feels guilty about asking his family for money, particularly his sisters, who have always been frugal and honest. He fears that they will be hurt by his request and that they will see him as selfish or lacking in integrity. He also feels that he has not been a good son to them, and that he is making a sacrifice by asking for their help. This sense of guilt and shame makes him hesitant to ask for the money, even though he knows that he needs it to support himself in Paris.", "ground_truth": "Andre knows that his family, despite their love for him, is poor, and he feels conflicted because his request will cause them financial strain. He is especially pained by the thought of his mother and sisters sacrificing their small savings and selling personal items like jewelry so that he can pursue his ambitions in Paris."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Pere Goriot.txt", "context_order": 2, "question": "Why does Andre de Villeneuve initially believe Mme. de Breuil is interested in him?", "prediction": "Andre initially believes Mme. de Breuil is interested in him because he notices her admiring glances and is drawn to her beauty, elegance, and charm. Additionally, he misinterprets her subtle actions, such as her subtle nod and glance, as a sign of affection. He also assumes that her sisters are jealous of her and her relationship with their father, which led to their marriage being affected, causing her to seek comfort and solace in the arms of another man, which, in her eyes, is Andre.", "ground_truth": "Andre suspects that Mme. de Breuil's interest in him is driven by a desire to make M. de Chambord jealous, rather than genuine attraction. He thinks she is using him to win back her lover, as her quick acceptance and invitation seemed more like a calculated move driven by pique."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Pere Goriot.txt", "context_order": 3, "question": "Why does Mme. de Breuil refuse to tell Andre about her troubles initially?", "prediction": "Mme. de Breuil refuses to tell Andre about her troubles initially because she wants to avoid hurting him. She has grown attached to him and values their relationship, and she also wants to protect herself from the pain of revealing her true feelings. By keeping her emotions hidden, she hopes to maintain a sense of control and avoid the risk of rejection or heartbreak.", "ground_truth": "Mme. de Breuil refuses to confide in Andre because she believes her personal troubles, which are part of a domestic quarrel, should remain private. Additionally, she feels that Andre is too closely involved, and revealing her secret may push him away or cause despair."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Pere Goriot.txt", "context_order": 4, "question": "Why does Mme. de Breuil believe her husband is trying to involve her in dishonest business dealings?", "prediction": "Mme. de Breuil believes her husband is trying to involve her in dishonest business dealings because she has discovered that he has been selling land on credit to contractors and then letting them go bankrupt, which would leave her with nothing. She suspects that her husband is using her name to secure loans, and that he plans to take control of the land and its profits, leaving her with a worthless dowry.", "ground_truth": "Mme. de Breuil realizes that her husband needs her to assist him in his fraudulent schemes by letting him continue running shady business deals in her name. When he promises to give her liberty in exchange for her complicity, she sees it as an attempt to make her an accomplice in his wrongdoing while maintaining a facade of respectability."}

"Clara is grateful because she fears the embarrassment and awkwardness that could arise if her brief engagement to Captain Hawthorne were widely known, especially with his sister and Admiral Sutherland potentially moving into Kellynch Hall. Having the secret confined to her father, Isabella, and Lady Violet Hargrove gives her a sense of comfort and privacy."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": 1, "question": "Based on his interactions, how does Captain Hawthorne feel about Clara Langley during their reunion?", "prediction": "Captain Hawthorne feels romantic and affectionate towards Clara Langley during their reunion, as evident from his words, actions, and behavior. He is drawn to her again, despite his earlier reluctance, and seems to have forgiven her for breaking off their engagement. He is also introspective and self-aware, acknowledging his own mistakes and blind spots, particularly his excessive pride and difficulty in opening up to Clara.", "ground_truth": "Captain Hawthorne exhibits mixed emotions regarding Clara. On one hand, he remains polite and distant, showing little desire to rekindle personal interactions, as seen in his studied politeness and cold formality. On the other hand, there's an unspoken layer of unresolved feelings, subtly revealed when he helps Clara lift the child without seeking acknowledgment, indicating an awareness of the past, but a reluctance to engage with it directly."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": 2, "question": "How does Clara feel about Captain Hawthorne after the events at Lyme?", "prediction": "Clara feels a mix of emotions towards Captain Hawthorne, including guilt, shame, and joy. She had initially deserted him at Lyme due to her engagement to Edmund Carlton, but upon learning of Beatrice's engagement to Captain Collins, she feels remorseful and guilty for having turned her back on him. Her feelings towards him are intensified when she reads his letter and discovers the depth of his love for her. Clara is torn between her gratitude for his love and her own self-doubt and uncertainty, but ultimately, she begins to see him in a new light and is relieved that their past misunderstandings are resolved.", "ground_truth": "Clara experiences mixed emotions towards Captain Hawthorne. While she feels gratitude for his care during the incident and the respect shown to her judgement, she also believes he harbors unresolved feelings of guilt and resentment towards her. She recognizes that he cannot forgive her for the past but is still moved by his underlying kindness in ensuring she is not left to suffer."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": 3, "question": "Why do you think Captain Collins ultimately did not visit Uppercross and chose instead to pursue Beatrice Broughton?", "prediction": "Captain Collins ultimately did not visit Uppercross and chose instead to pursue Beatrice Broughton because he had formed a strong attachment to her during their time together at Uppercross, which superseded his previous concern for his health and his loyalty to his brother, Captain Hawthorne. His feelings for Beatrice were genuine and intense, and he could not bear the thought of giving her up.", "ground_truth": "Captain Collins may have been initially hesitant to visit Uppercross after learning that Lady Violet Hargrove lived three miles away; this disappointment likely contributed to his reluctance. Additionally, spending weeks together with Beatrice Broughton at a time when she was recovering from illness provided an opportunity for a bond to develop, and this shared time may have led to their engagement."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": 4, "question": "Why does Mr. Langley feel apprehensive about the situation involving Clara's father and Mrs. Stone?", "prediction": "Mr. Langley feels apprehensive because he thinks Mrs. Stone is only using Clara for his own gain, and that she will be lost to him once Clara marries him. He is also concerned that Clara may be compromising her own moral character by associating with someone as \"low\" as Mrs. Stone.", "ground_truth": "Mr. Langley is concerned that Mrs. Stone is attempting to marry Clara's father, Lord Albert, which could jeopardize the family inheritance, particularly affecting his chances of becoming Sir William. His attentions to the family, and efforts to closely watch Mrs. Stone’s actions, are driven by this fear of losing his potential claim."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": 5, "question": "Why does Clara want to avoid Mr. Langley and what leads her to this decision?", "prediction": "Clara wants to avoid Mr. Langley because she believes he is a disingenuous and artificial man who has no feeling for others, and his past behavior towards Mrs. Johnson suggests he is unkind and inhuman. She also thinks he is primarily interested in her because of her social connections and would not be a suitable match for her. Her observations of him lead her to conclude that he is not a good match for her, making her hesitant to engage with him.", "ground_truth": "Clara desires to avoid Mr. Langley because she now perceives him as insincere, especially after reflecting on his past behavior, including his disrespect towards her friend Mrs. Johnson and his recent interactions with her father and sister. Her decision to distance herself arises from her enhanced understanding of his manipulative actions and lack of genuine character."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Persuasion.txt", "context_order": "full", "question": "Why does Captain Wentworth ultimately return to profess his feelings for Clara instead of Beatrice?", "prediction": "Captain Wentworth ultimately returns to profess his feelings for Clara because he realizes that he was blind to her true character and was angry and resentful towards her when she rejected his proposal. He also comes to understand that his feelings for her are genuine and enduring, and that he cannot imagine loving anyone else. Additionally, his interactions with Beatrice Broughton reveal that he was not truly in love with her, and that his behavior towards Clara was motivated by pride and jealousy.", "ground_truth": "Captain Wentworth realizes that he has been in love with Clara all along and that his feelings for Beatrice were a mere attempt to distract himself. He admits to having been too proud and resentful in the past to understand the constancy of his true feelings for Clara, but after witnessing her demeanor at Uppercross and Lyme, and understanding her character more deeply, he becomes certain that only Clara holds his heart."}
{"type": "novel_fake", "level": "reasoning", "file": "Philosopher’s Stone.txt", "context_order": 0, "question": "Why does Uncle Victor Dursley try to leave unknowingly after hearing the name 'Thorn' during lunch?", "prediction": "He doesn't try to leave. The text does not mention Uncle Victor Dursley trying to leave after hearing the name \"Thorn\".", "ground_truth": "Uncle Victor Dursley becomes fearful when he overhears people in cloaks mentioning the name 'Thorn,' suspecting that they are discussing his nephew, Henry Thorn, and the strange world he comes from. This fear stems from the Dursleys' long-time efforts to hide the existence of Henry's magical heritage and their belief that any involvement with it could bring trouble to their family."}

The Grand March, which was once a symbol of solidarity and conviction, has become a hollow and irrelevant exercise in posturing, and the participants are more concerned with being seen as part of a \"grand march\" than with actually making a meaningful difference.
