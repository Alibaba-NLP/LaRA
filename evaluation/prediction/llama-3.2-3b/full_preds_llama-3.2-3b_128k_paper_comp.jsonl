It uses LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to evaluate the model's own responses, generating and evaluating new instruction-following examples to add to its own training set. In contrast, paper 3 presents Orca-Math, which creates a synthetic dataset of 200k math problems paired with GPT-4 solutions, utilizing an agent-based setup to generate diverse and challenging problems. While Orca-Math relies on a significant dataset, SPIN only needs a smaller dataset and uses the model's own responses as a proxy for human feedback.", "ground_truth": "Paper 2 introduces a self-rewarding mechanism where the model evaluates and improves its own responses using AI feedback, while paper 3's Kahneman-Tversky Optimization uses a binary signal of desirability, making it less reliant on preference data."}
{"type": "paper", "level": "comp", "file": "128k_paper_0.md", "comp_parts": [2, 4], "question": "What iterative training approach is utilized in paper 2 for enhancing instruction following and reward modeling ability, and how does it compare to the approach used in paper 4 for improving mathematical reasoning in small language models?", "prediction": "Paper 2 uses an iterative learning technique that combines supervised fine-tuning and preference learning, where the model generates multiple solutions and receives feedback on its solutions and learns from preference pairs. This approach, called Orca-Math, achieves 86.81% accuracy on GSM8k without needing multiple model calls or external tools.\n\nIn contrast, paper 4 introduces KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization), a prospect-theoretic optimization approach that directly maximizes human utility instead of maximizing preference likelihood. KTO learns from binary \"yes\" or \"no\" feedback and can handle extreme data imbalances, matching DPO performance while using up to 90% fewer desirable examples.\n\nThe main difference between the two approaches is that Orca-Math uses a more traditional fine-tuning approach, while KTO uses a prospect-theoretic optimization approach that takes into account human biases and preferences.", "ground_truth": "In paper 2, an Iterative DPO framework is used for self-rewarding models that improve instruction following and reward modeling, whereas paper 4 uses iterative preference learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to enhance SLMs' performance on math problems."}

Orca-Math achieves higher model performance on the GSM8K benchmark, reaching 86.81% accuracy, compared to TinyGSM's 81.5% accuracy.", "ground_truth": "TinyGSM in paper 0 uses a larger synthetic dataset of 12.3M problems achieving 81.5% accuracy on GSM8K, whereas Orca-Math in paper 4 uses a smaller dataset of 200K problems but attains a higher accuracy of 86.81% on the same benchmark."}

While ReST^EM generates multiple solutions per problem, SAPO generates multiple solutions and filters them using binary feedback. SAPO uses a teacher-forcing segment-level supervision method, where the model generates tailored segments to improve performance. ReST^EM, on the other hand, fine-tunes the base model from the last iteration, whereas SAPO fine-tunes the base model in each iteration. SAPO's approach is more general and flexible, allowing it to be applied to various tasks and datasets.", "ground_truth": "SAPO in paper 2 employs off-policy RL with a replay buffer to dynamically update training data without pre-collected paired datasets, while ReST^EM in paper 4 uses EM to iteratively fine-tune on model-generated data with a binary feedback mechanism, both reducing reliance on human data but employing different sampling and optimization strategies."}

In contrast, Paper 3 introduces ReST ${ }^{E M}$, which fine-tunes language models on model-generated data combined with a reward function. The key differences are:\n\n* SAPO generates synthetic data through self-play, while ReST ${ }^{E M}$ fine-tunes on model-generated data.\n* SAPO uses self-play to generate data, while ReST ${ }^{E M}$ uses human-generated data and model-generated data.\n\nBoth methods aim to reduce dependence on human data, but SAPO takes a more automated approach, whereas ReST ${ }^{E M}$ relies on human-generated data.", "ground_truth": "Paper 2 proposes Self-Augmented Preference Optimization (SAPO) to dynamically update LLM training data for better alignment with human preferences, while paper 3 employs synthetic corruption informed pruning (SCIP) to identify and remove low-quality data in code datasets by exploiting embedding space characteristics."}

This differs from the Direct Preference Optimization methods used in paper 1, which rely on human-annotated data for preference learning. The paper 3 methods provide a novel approach to pruning code data, leveraging synthetic corruptions to improve data quality and model performance.", "ground_truth": "Paper 3 uses synthetic corruption to identify dataset weaknesses by moving embeddings to smaller clusters or further from centroids, facilitating efficient low-quality data pruning, while paper 1 employs Direct Preference Optimization to align image outputs with human preferences, focusing on semantic differences between winning and losing samples for improving image fidelity."}

Using a teacher-student collaborative framework, where a strong teacher model helps a smaller student model learn from its own outputs, reducing the need for extensive human annotation.\n2. Employing self-generated data, such as synthetic images or text, to augment the training dataset, which can be more efficient and cost-effective than collecting human-annotated data.\n3. Leveraging the knowledge distillation effect, where the teacher model shares its knowledge with the student model, improving the student's performance with minimal additional supervision.\n4. Using a verifier to select the best response from multiple candidate generations, reducing the need for extensive evaluation and feedback.\n\nThese approaches aim to make data annotation more efficient and scalable, enabling large language models to achieve high performance with reduced computational resources and costs.", "ground_truth": "Paper 2's TS-Align framework employs a teacher-student collaboration model to automate preference data extraction, while paper 3's TinyGSM approach uses synthetic data generated by GPT-3.5 to train small models, both aiming to reduce dependence on costly human annotations."}

Paper 3 proposes TinyGSM, a synthetic dataset of 12.3M grade school math problems paired with Python solutions, generated fully by GPT-3.5. Both papers achieve significant improvements in model performance using self-generated or synthetic data.\n\nThe outcomes of their methods are:\n\n* Paper 1: STIC improves the performance of large vision language models (LVLMs) by generating a preference dataset for image descriptions from unlabeled images. The final aligned policy model achieves an average accuracy gain of 4.0% across seven benchmarks.\n* Paper 3: TinyGSM significantly boosts the performance of small language models on grade school math problems.

Using high-quality datasets to augment training data, which improves model performance.\n2. Employing self-generated preference data to improve model performance.\n3. Using iterative fine-tuning to refine model performance over multiple iterations.\n4. Focusing on leveraging model capabilities to improve performance, rather than simply relying on manual supervision or labeled data.\n\nHowever, there are also some differences in their approaches, such as the specific task domains they focus on (math and vision-language, respectively) and the level of fine-tuning required to achieve significant improvements.", "ground_truth": "Both papers 3 and 4 emphasize the use of auxiliary verification or confidence mechanisms to enhance model performance, with paper 3 utilizing verifiers for small models in mathematical reasoning, while paper 4 implements auxiliary confidence losses to avoid imitating weak supervisor mistakes in NLP tasks."}
