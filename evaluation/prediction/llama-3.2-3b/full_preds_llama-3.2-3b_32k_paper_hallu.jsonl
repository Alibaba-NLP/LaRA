LLMs can leverage vast amounts of training data to generate high-quality query expansions, which can improve the retrieval performance in languages with limited training data.\n\nHowever, the limited availability of training data and the need for domain-specific knowledge may hinder the effectiveness of LLM-based query expansion for low-resource languages. Furthermore, the performance of LLM-based query expansion may depend on the size and quality of the training data, as well as the specific LLM model used.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers may need to explore alternative approaches, such as:\n\n1. Fine-tuning LLMs on low-resource languages to adapt them to specific domains and languages.\n2. Developing domain-specific LLMs that are trained on low-resource languages to improve the quality of query expansions.\n3. Utilizing transfer learning and multitask learning to leverage pre-trained LLMs for low-resource languages.\n4. Developing new query expansion methods that are specifically designed for low-resource languages.\n\nOverall, the use of LLMs for query expansion in cross-language information retrieval tasks has the potential to improve the performance of low-resource languages, but further research is needed to fully explore the implications and potential of this approach.", "ground_truth": "Paper 1 does not explore the implications of query expansion using LLMs on cross-language information retrieval tasks, nor does it focus on low-resource languages in this context."}
