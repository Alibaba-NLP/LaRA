CALDERA decomposes the weight matrix into three components: Q, L, and R, where Q is quantized aggressively, and L and R are low-rank factors that capture the effect of large singular components of the weight matrix. This decomposition allows for a more efficient compression strategy, enabling the use of a smaller quantization bit budget while maintaining or even improving model performance.

It then builds a fine-grained runtime estimator that accurately predicts kernel performance on input sizes that might not have been profiled, using a prediction strategy for unprofiled input sizes. This allows Vidur to provide high-fidelity predictions of iteration times despite the variability in LLM inference.", "ground_truth": "Vidur addresses the challenge of varying iteration times by classifying LLM operations into token-level, sequence-level, and communication operators, enabling tailored runtime prediction strategies. It separates profiling for prefill and decode phases, recognizing the compute differences, and applies strategies like modeling attention kernel time based on memory-bound operations, which allows estimation of runtime based on total KV-Cache reads rather than individual request history."}

This is achieved through a co-adaptive scheduler that predicts minimal computing resources based on historical input-output length distributions and request arriving rates.", "ground_truth": "Aladdin's design addresses this variability by dynamically adjusting the number of workers based on the real-time analysis of query arrival rates and features, ensuring that the minimum number of GPUs is utilized while still meeting all Service Level Objectives (SLOs). This co-adaptive approach to resource scaling and query placement allows Aladdin to optimize worker configuration to efficiently handle periods of high demand during the day and reduce resource allocation during lower demand at night."}

The prompts phase is impacted by power caps, but token generation has no performance impact with a 50% lower power cap per GPU. This design aims to balance cost, power, and throughput. Power capping the token machines reduces the overall power consumption of the cluster, but the token generation phases may still be impacted by the reduced power availability.", "ground_truth": "The decision to power cap token machines in Splitwise-HHcap clusters is supported by Insight VII, which indicates that token generation phases do not efficiently utilize the full power capacity due to their memory-bound nature. Power capping the token machines to 50% of their power does not impact performance, as the token generation phase incurs almost no latency with reduced power, aligning with the goal of ensuring efficiency without sacrificing throughput."}

This is especially true for workloads with heavy decodes, where TetriInfer improves TTFT and JCT by 97% and 47%, respectively, and uses 38% less resources.", "ground_truth": "TetriInfer is designed to disaggregate prefill and decode instances, reducing interference significantly during decode-heavy tasks like LPHD, leading to a substantial decrease in time-to-first-token and resource usage, which boosts performance per dollar by optimizing hardware efficiency. However, for HPHD workloads, the improvement potential is smaller, and the overhead of disaggregation cannot be fully offset, thus making the system less cost-effective for these tasks relative to LPHD workloads."}

This dual-stage tuning enables GraphGPT to better generalize across tasks, outperforming language models that rely only on text, which often miss nuanced structural contexts present in graph data.

When UniTSA, a conventional RL-based method, fails to receive accurate data from the north side due to a damaged sensor, LA-Light identifies the faulty sensor data and adjusts the signal to green phase P1, effectively reducing congestion at the intersection.", "ground_truth": "The LA-Light framework effectively handles Sensor Outage (SO) situations by utilizing large language models (LLMs) which can infer traffic conditions based on partial data and reasoning, whereas RL-based methods struggle without complete sensor information.

Resorting to External Knowledge\n2. Merging Knowledge into the Model\n3. Editing Intrinsic Knowledge\n\nThe authors' reasoning for this categorization is based on educational and cognitive research theories, such as the recognition, association, and mastery phases of human learning. They draw parallels between these human learning phases and the corresponding knowledge editing approaches. For example:\n\n* Resorting to External Knowledge resembles the recognition phase, where a model is exposed to new knowledge within a relevant context.\n* Merging Knowledge into the Model is similar to the association phase, where connections are formed between new knowledge and existing knowledge in the model.\n* Editing Intrinsic Knowledge is akin to the mastery phase, where the model fully integrates knowledge into its parameters.\n\nThis categorization provides a unified view of knowledge editing methods based on the educational and cognitive research theories.", "ground_truth": "The authors categorize knowledge editing methods into recognition, association, and mastery phases by drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes.

In such cases, LLMs may struggle to accurately generate responses or may even produce hallucinated answers.", "ground_truth": "In paper 1, when external knowledge is incomplete or irrelevant, it necessitates a nuanced integration of external and parametric knowledge for a cooperative response in scenarios S2 and S3. This complexity complicates the precise delineation of knowledge boundaries and access to parametric knowledge, challenging the LLM's capability to perform effective knowledge fusion, especially when model-specific parametric knowledge must supplement the external information."}

For example, using zsmalloc as the pool manager has a lower memory TCO than using zbud, because zsmalloc can pack compressed objects more tightly.", "ground_truth": "The choice of memory allocator impacts the trade-off as zsmalloc creates high memory TCO savings due to dense packing of compressed objects but incurs higher memory management overhead, thus increasing latency.
