He understands that time is not a separate entity, but rather a dimension that is intertwined with the three dimensions of space. He uses this understanding to build his time machine, which he claims can travel through time by moving along this fourth dimension.\n\nSpecifically, the Time Traveller's invention features a lever that, when pressed, sends the machine gliding into the future, and another lever that reverses the motion. He claims that the machine is designed to move through time at various velocities, but that it appears to travel at different speeds depending on the observer's frame of reference.\n\nThe Time Traveller's invention is based on his understanding that time is a dimension that can be moved through, just like the three dimensions of space, and that the machine can be used to travel through time in various ways.", "ground_truth": "The Time Traveller explains time as a fourth dimension comparable to space, where consciousness typically moves in one direction, and he uses this concept to create a machine that can travel through time, freely moving forward and backward."}
