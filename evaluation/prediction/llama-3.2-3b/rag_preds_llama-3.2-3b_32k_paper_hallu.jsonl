The paper discusses the implementation and performance of 4-clique network minor embedding on D-Wave quantum annealers for solving optimization problems, specifically spin glass problems. The results show that 4-clique minor embedding can provide more robust and stable solutions, especially at low chain strengths, compared to linear path minor embedding.
