{"type": "financial", "level": "hallu", "file": "MediaAlpha, Inc..txt", "context_order": 3, "question": "What is the company's current cash burn rate?", "prediction": "The current cash burn rate of MediaAlpha, Inc. is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text snippet, but we can calculate it from the available data. \n\nCash burn rate is typically the rate at which a company is using up its cash reserves, and can be expressed in various ways. One common way to express it is as a rate per month, or per quarter, based on the company's cash flow and cash balance.\n\n\nLet's use the total debt and operating expenses to make an estimate of the cash burn rate. Based on the information provided in the \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section, MediaAlpha had a net loss of $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The total operating expenses were $428 million for the same period. Assuming the net loss is a reasonable proxy for cash burn (without considering non-cash items and changes in working capital), we can estimate the cash burn rate for the year.\n\n\nGiven that the current cash and cash equivalents stood at $17.3 million as of December 31, 2023, and assuming no significant changes in working capital or other adjustments to this cash balance other than the cash burn itself that the company faces in the following periods, if we consider only the net loss as a simplified view of cash burn without adjusting for working capital changes and non-cash expenses, the annual burn rate is roughly $56.6 million. This annual burn gives an annual burn rate, but to find the monthly or quarterly cash burn rate, we can divide this number accordingly.\n\n\nThe cash burn rate per quarter would thus be approximately $14.15 million ($56.6 million / 4). To estimate the cash burn rate per month, we divide by 12 to get roughly $4.72 million per month ($56.6 million / 12). Given these calculations and rounding, we could say that the current cash burn rate for MediaAlpha, based on loss for the latest fiscal year, is approximately $4.7 million to $14 million per month to per quarter, respectively.\n\n\nHowever, this is an approximation and the real cash burn may vary significantly based on the specifics of the company's operations, changes in profitability, the impact of non-cash items on net loss, and other factors, and should be taken as a very rough estimate based on limited information. The company itself likely has more detailed and current cash flow projections and may provide guidance on cash burn in its financials or investor communications.", "ground_truth": "The financial statement does not specify the company's current cash burn rate."}
