The authors propose structuring the risk landscape to help guide mitigation work and advocate for fair benchmarking and framework tools. They discuss the importance of transparency and explainability methods and address limitations of the paper.\n\nPaper 1 proposes TierScape, a system with multiple software-defined compressed memory tiers, to tame server memory Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The authors argue that existing 2-Tier solutions are limited and propose an alternative approach, demonstrating its benefits through a waterfall model and an analytical model that provide fine control over page placement. While the authors do not explicitly discuss bias in Paper 1, they focus on memory TCO savings and performance penalties, implying that addressing bias may require additional consideration in TierScape.\n\nHowever, paper 0 explicitly discusses bias, presenting association tests, co-occurrence analyses, and sentiment analyses designed to assess bias along various dimensions, focusing on issues related to gender, ethnicity, and religion. The authors analyze the bias exhibited by the model and provide evidence of significant bias, highlighting the need for anti-bias countermeasures.The authors also qualitatively examine the language generation capabilities of MT-NLG on novel scenarios, showcasing its ability in solving riddles, answering Jeopardy questions, and generating code off-the-shelf.
