However, as he learns more about their society, he comes to see the Eloi as weak, complacent, and dependent on the Morlocks, who are revealed to be the true rulers of the underground world. The Time Traveller's perception of the Morlocks shifts from fear and revulsion to a recognition of their intelligence, industry, and dominance over the Eloi. Ultimately, he realizes that the Morlocks are the descendants of the working class, who have evolved to survive in the underground, while the Eloi are the remnants of the upper class, who have degenerated into a state of helpless beauty.", "ground_truth": "Initially, the Time Traveller sees the Eloi as a peaceful, if childlike, race and the Morlocks as a mysterious underground presence; however, he later discovers that the Eloi are essentially prey for the cannibalistic Morlocks, leading to a deeper fear and understanding of the relationship between the two species."}

He believes that time is not separate from space, but rather another direction that can be moved through, just like the other dimensions. Utilizing this understanding, he builds a time machine that allows him to travel through time by manipulating his position in the fourth dimension, effectively moving through the past or future.", "ground_truth": "The Time Traveller explains time as a fourth dimension comparable to space, where consciousness typically moves in one direction, and he uses this concept to create a machine that can travel through time, freely moving forward and backward."}
