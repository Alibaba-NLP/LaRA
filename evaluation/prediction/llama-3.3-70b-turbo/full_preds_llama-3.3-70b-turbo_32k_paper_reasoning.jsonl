This size allows the model to capture relevant context without being overwhelmed by too much distant information, leading to a significant improvement in MRR by around 5%, which suggests an optimal balance between relevance and contextual influence."}

Studies show that LLMs, when attempting self-critiquing, fail to improve their performance on tasks like graph coloring, as they often cannot recognize correct solutions and wrongly pass over them, ending up with incorrect ones."}
{"type": "paper", "level": "reasoning", "file": "32k_paper_5.md", "context_order": 1, "question": "In paper 1, what rationale do the authors provide for the decrease in reasoning performance of LLMs when self-correction is attempted intrinsically?", "prediction": "The authors provide an intuitive explanation that when the model is well-aligned and paired with a thoughtfully designed initial prompt, the initial response should already be optimal. Introducing feedback can be seen as adding an additional prompt, which may not offer any extra advantage and can even bias the model away from producing an optimal response.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that LLMs cannot effectively judge the correctness of their reasoning, leading to a higher likelihood of altering correct answers to incorrect ones rather than fixing mistakes. Additionally, if a model is initially well-aligned with a well-designed prompt, further feedback may skew responses away from optimal, thus lowering performance instead of improving it."}

This high rate of false positives compromises the system's reliability, particularly in scenarios where correct plan validation is crucial, casting doubt on the efficacy of such systems in ensuring accurate planning outputs."}

This is based on the reasoning that Pre-LN's loose reliance on residual branches limits the model potential, while Post-LN's strong dependency amplifies fluctuations and destabilizes training. Admin balances these issues, allowing for stable training and better performance.", "ground_truth": "The Admin method introduced in paper 1 controls residual dependencies during the initial training stages to ensure stability by aiming for an output change of $O(\\log N)$, which addresses the amplification effect causing instability in Post-LN training. This method is inspired by the understanding that Post-LN's strong layer dependency amplifies fluctuations more than Pre-LN, thus Admin balances these dependencies early on to stabilize the training while retaining full model potential in later stages."}

The method achieves this by manipulating position indices to resemble the original structure used during pre-training, thereby preserving the model's language modeling ability.", "ground_truth": "PoSE retains the pre-trained capabilities by ensuring the continuity of position indices within each chunk during fine-tuning, which closely resembles the structure of pre-training.

In contrast, 4-clique minor embeddings could provide lower chain break rates due to increased inter-chain integrity, making them more suitable for large problem sizes.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that 4-clique minor embeddings might be more beneficial on future large quantum annealers because current Pegasus devices, with their relatively limited size, do not leverage the full potential of 4-clique embeddings, which require longer chains and thus greater hardware usage compared to optimized linear path embeddings.
