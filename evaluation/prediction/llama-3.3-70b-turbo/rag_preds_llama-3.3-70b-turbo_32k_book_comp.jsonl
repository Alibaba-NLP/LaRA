He understands that humans move through time in a linear fashion, but believes it's possible to move through time in a non-linear way, just like moving through the other dimensions of space. Utilizing this understanding, he builds a time machine that can travel through time, allowing the user to move forward or backward in time by manipulating the machine's levers.", "ground_truth": "The Time Traveller explains time as a fourth dimension comparable to space, where consciousness typically moves in one direction, and he uses this concept to create a machine that can travel through time, freely moving forward and backward."}
