In fact, the opposite is stated: \"Madame and Miss Chastain were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially.\" This suggests that Verne believes the perpetrator was human.", "ground_truth": "Verne notes that the strength required to tear out tresses of hair and thrust a body up the chimney, along with the bizarre nature of the injuries and the unusual hand impressions on the victim's throat, indicate the actions of a non-human. Additionally, the voice heard by witnesses was not comprehensible, adding to the strangeness of the scene. These factors combined led him to reason that the culprit was not human but an animal, specifically an Ourang-Outang."}

He then examines the windows and finds that they were fastened from the inside, but concludes that the assassins could not have refastened them from the outside, so they must have been closed by a hidden mechanism, such as a spring, which he later discovers.", "ground_truth": "Verne concludes that since both doors were locked with the keys inside, and the chimneys were too narrow, the only possible mode of egress was through the window. By investigating further, he finds a hidden spring that could allow the window to appear locked from the inside after the escape, proving that the killers did indeed flee through the window."}

He believes that killing the fish is not a sin if done out of necessity and with respect.", "ground_truth": "Guillermo admires the fish for its strength and beauty, even calling it his 'brother.'

Although he needed to kill it for survival and to earn a living, he realizes that his actions were also driven by pride, which causes him to question whether it was a sin."}
