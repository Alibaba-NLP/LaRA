In contrast, paper 2 proposes a multiple-tier compressed memory system, TierScape, to reduce memory costs in data centers. While both papers aim to reduce costs, the strategies proposed in paper 0 focus on mitigating risks associated with language models, such as discrimination, exclusion, and misinformation, whereas TierScape focuses on optimizing memory usage and reducing costs in data centers. Despite these differences, both papers share a common goal of optimizing system performance and reducing costs, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary approaches to address complex challenges in AI and data center management.", "ground_truth": "Paper 0 emphasizes structuring risks with mitigation using participatory, social, and technical methods to improve inclusivity and fairness in language models while paper 2 introduces TierScape's multi-tiered memory management with software-defined tiers to reduce TCO by balancing performance and cost efficiency."}
