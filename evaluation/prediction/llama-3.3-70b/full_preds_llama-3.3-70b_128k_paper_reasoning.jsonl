Furthermore, they highlight the importance of traceability of changes connected to changes in the training corpus and the model itself to guide efforts to identify and mitigate exclusionary norms.", "ground_truth": "The authors suggest that exclusionary norms in language models, such as narrowly defining 'family,' can be mitigated by utilizing participatory projects to create inclusive training datasets and avoiding the deterministic argmax sampling by instead using probabilistic sampling methods. These measures can prevent the entrenchment of single, overly simplistic views which fail to represent diverse social realities."}

This approach allows for reduction in memory consumption by distributing the computational load and memory storage across multiple GPUs, while maintaining compute efficiency by organizing the parallel operations in a way that optimally utilizes the high computation and communication bandwidth between GPUs."}
{"type": "paper", "level": "reasoning", "file": "128k_paper_9.md", "context_order": 2, "question": "In paper 2, how does the choice of memory allocator impact the trade-off between memory TCO savings and performance when using compressed memory tiers?", "prediction": "The choice of memory allocator (e.g., zsmalloc, zbud, z3fold) affects the trade-off between memory TCO savings and performance. Zsmalloc is suitable for high memory TCO saving tiers but has high memory management overheads, whereas zbud is simpler and faster, making it suitable for low latency tiers but with lower memory TCO savings.", "ground_truth": "The choice of memory allocator impacts the trade-off as zsmalloc creates high memory TCO savings due to dense packing of compressed objects but incurs higher memory management overhead, thus increasing latency. In contrast, zbud offers faster access with lower management overhead but provides less TCO savings due to storing fewer compressed objects, thus shaping how aggressively data can be placed in compressed tiers without impacting performance significantly."}
