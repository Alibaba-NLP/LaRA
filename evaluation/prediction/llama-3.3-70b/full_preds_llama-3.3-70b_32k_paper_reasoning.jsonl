Choosing a smaller model as the amateur is beneficial because it emphasizes the failure modes of the expert model, such as repetition and incoherence, allowing contrastive decoding to downweight these undesired behaviors and produce higher-quality text.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models.

The reasoning structure composed from atomic modules, such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, contributes to these improvements, allowing the model to follow an explicit reasoning structure during decoding.", "ground_truth": "SELF-DISCOVER improves task performance efficiently by composing reasoning structures based on atomic reasoning modules, which leverage various cognitive strategies in a structured manner. This modular integration allows it to outperform more inference-heavy methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting with substantially fewer inference calls, as it requires only three initial meta-prompt steps and applies a universal reasoning structure consistently.

FaR is effective because it encourages LLMs to identify relevant inferences and connect them to actions, addressing the key challenge of implicit inference identification.

This limitation results in LLMs generating incorrect executable plans, with only about 12% of plans being error-free and reaching their goals.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

Studies show that LLMs, when attempting self-critiquing, fail to improve their performance on tasks like graph coloring, as they often cannot recognize correct solutions and wrongly pass over them, ending up with incorrect ones."}

Additionally, if a model is initially well-aligned with a well-designed prompt, further feedback may skew responses away from optimal, thus lowering performance instead of improving it."}

This high rate of false positives compromises the system's reliability, particularly in scenarios where correct plan validation is crucial, casting doubt on the efficacy of such systems in ensuring accurate planning outputs."}

ADMIN initializes the model parameters to balance the contribution of the residual branch and the subnetworks, which helps to mitigate the optimization challenges and vanishing gradient issues that arise in deep Transformers. This allows for the successful training of models with up to 60 encoder layers and 12 decoder layers, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.", "ground_truth": "The initialization technique, ADMIN, helps balance the contributions of different terms in the model, addressing unequal magnitudes that lead to instability. By determining a suitable scaling factor (𝜔𝑖) during the profiling phase, the technique stabilizes training, allowing for the successful use of deeper models with 60 encoder layers and 12 decoder layers without diverging, unlike with default initialization where models fail to converge."}

This improvement is based on the reasoning that Post-LN's strong dependency on residual branches amplifies fluctuations brought by parameter changes and destabilizes training, while Pre-LN's loose reliance limits the model's potential.", "ground_truth": "The Admin method introduced in paper 1 controls residual dependencies during the initial training stages to ensure stability by aiming for an output change of $O(\\log N)$, which addresses the amplification effect causing instability in Post-LN training. This method is inspired by the understanding that Post-LN's strong layer dependency amplifies fluctuations more than Pre-LN, thus Admin balances these dependencies early on to stabilize the training while retaining full model potential in later stages."}

This architectural choice reduces memory requirements and boosts throughput, offering competitive advantages on benchmarks where efficiency and handling longer contexts are critical. Consequently, even with fewer parameters, Mistral 7B manages to excel in reasoning and mathematics tasks by optimizing the trade-off between model size, performance, and computational efficiency."}
