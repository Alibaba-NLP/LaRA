For January 29, 2023: $22,101 million / 2,466 million = approximately $8.96 billion / 2.466 billion = $3,636 per share (but this is not directly useful). \n\nFor a more accurate estimate, we should look at the stock repurchases. In chunk 4, NVIDIA repurchased 21 million shares for $9.7 billion, which is an average price of $9.7 billion / 21 million = $462 per share.\n\nHowever, to estimate the effect of the 2 million share decrease on the $20,877 million equity change, let's assume an average price per share. Since we repurchased shares at an average price of $462 and the market price varied, using the repurchase price as a rough estimate for the average price change is reasonable.\n\nThe change due to the 2 million share decrease would be approximately 2 million shares * $462 per share = $924 million reduction in equity due to the decrease in shares outstanding.\n\nSo, the change in shares outstanding contributed a reduction of $924 million to the change in total shareholders' equity from January 29, 2023, to January 28, 2024.", "ground_truth": "The number of shares outstanding decreased from 2,466 million to 2,464 million, a reduction by 2 million shares, primarily due to repurchases.
