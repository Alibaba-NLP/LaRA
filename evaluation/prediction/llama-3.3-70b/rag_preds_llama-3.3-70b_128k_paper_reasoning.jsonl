This approach provides an advantage over other GANs by being more stable, avoiding mode-dropping and non-convergence, and using only one critic, making it a comparably more stable and effective method for fair data generation.", "ground_truth": "The TabFairGAN model employs a two-phase training process: the first phase focuses on generating accurate synthetic data that closely follows the original data distribution, while the second phase introduces a fairness constraint into the generator's loss function to produce data with less discrimination based on the protected attributes. This approach not only achieves high-quality data similar to real datasets, but it also effectively reduces discrimination.

This reveals that models achieving high accuracy on the NIAH test may still exhibit large performance drops as context length increases, indicating limitations in their long-context understanding capabilities.", "ground_truth": "The NIAH test focuses on simple retrieval, indicating superficial long-context understanding, whereas RULER introduces complexity with tasks like multi-hop tracing and aggregation.
