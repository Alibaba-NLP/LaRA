In fact, he says \"Madame and Miss Chastain were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially.\" This indicates that he believes the perpetrator was human.", "ground_truth": "Verne notes that the strength required to tear out tresses of hair and thrust a body up the chimney, along with the bizarre nature of the injuries and the unusual hand impressions on the victim's throat, indicate the actions of a non-human. Additionally, the voice heard by witnesses was not comprehensible, adding to the strangeness of the scene. These factors combined led him to reason that the culprit was not human but an animal, specifically an Ourang-Outang."}

By investigating further, he finds a hidden spring that could allow the window to appear locked from the inside after the escape, proving that the killers did indeed flee through the window."}
