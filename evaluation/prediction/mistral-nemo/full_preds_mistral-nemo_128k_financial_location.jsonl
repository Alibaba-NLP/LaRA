Unrecognized Tax Benefit Liabilities: These represent the amount of tax benefits that the Company has recognized as a deferred asset and expects to reverse in the future as a result of uncertainty about the validity of certain tax positions taken. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $31.7 million, which relates to various uncertainties associated with its global operations, including potential challenges from tax authorities related to the proper characterization of certain transactions, the application of certain tax incentives, and the Company's ability to maintain its tax efficient structure. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of any related examinations or potential adjustments that may impact these liabilities.\n\n2. Uncertain Tax Position Liabilities: These represent the Company's estimate of the potential additional tax liability that could arise from federal, state, and foreign tax examinations or uncertainties in the Company's tax accounting methods, including transfer pricing, research and development tax credits, and valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had uncertain tax position liabilities of $0.7 million, which is considered remote due to the lack of accumulated interest and penalties, and management believes there is no reasonable possibility that these amounts will be required to be settled in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Company continually assesses and updates its estimates for uncertain tax positions. The Company's ability to accurately estimate and provide for these liabilities is subject to various uncertainties, and actual future tax liabilities may vary materially from these estimates. The Company monitors its unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and uncertain tax position liabilities and records accrued interest and penalties based on the applicable rates and statutes of limitations, as appropriate. If applicable, the Company would make provisions for unsettled tax liabilities using the valuation allowance method, which estimates the appropriate amount of the income tax payable on the related deferred tax assets, net of related interest and penalties.", "ground_truth": "The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions."}
