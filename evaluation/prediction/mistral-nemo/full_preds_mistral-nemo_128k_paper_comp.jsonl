However, the techniques differ in their focus and methodology.", "ground_truth": "Both papers address the challenge of managing vast parameter spaces in LLMs; paper 0 focuses on efficient and effective post-hoc modifications to LLMs to maintain or enhance knowledge without retraining, while paper 2 develops non-vacuous generalization bounds to confirm LLMs' ability to generalize beyond training data."}

The LLM generates responses based on user prompts, while the External Knowledge Base supplies additional relevant information via an Information Generation Network (IGN), helping the LLM to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses. No explicit knowledge editing or fusion is mentioned in this paper.", "ground_truth": "Paper 1 emphasizes enhancing parametric knowledge through a systematic pipeline for data construction and infusion to improve LLMs' knowledge retention and integration capabilities, while paper 2 focuses on compressibility and generalization bounds, showing that larger LLMs can better compress and generalize beyond training data due to effectively capturing regularities."}
