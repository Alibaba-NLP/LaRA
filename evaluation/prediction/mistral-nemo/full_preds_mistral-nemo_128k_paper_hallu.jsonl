For instance, snow can lead to increased reflectance, causing models to provide misleading or insensitive responses. Rain can result in reduced visibility, leading to inaccurate or delayed reactions. Fog can hinder the efficacy of LLMs by adding noise to sensor inputs, making it more difficult for the models to understand the environment and make informed decisions.", "ground_truth": "Paper 3 does not discuss the specific effects of different weather conditions on the decision-making capabilities of LLM in traffic management."}

However, it can be inferred that the use of such models may have both positive and negative effects on operators. On one hand, the models' ability to provide clear explanations, suggestions, and even interactive control may enhance operators' understanding, decision-making confidence, and overall job satisfaction. On the other hand, relying too heavily on the models might lead to overtrust, reduced vigilance, and potential burnout due to constant interaction. Moreover, the models' occasional inaccuracies or lack of contextual understanding could cause frustration or loss of confidence in human operators.", "ground_truth": "Paper 4 does not address the psychological impacts on human operators when collaborating with large language models for accelerator tuning."}

This complexity is reduced to O(log(2/d)+log(4/d)) through subsampling methods, which makes the bound computation more practical.", "ground_truth": "Paper 1 does not discuss the computational cost associated with the four distinct scenarios of knowledge fusion on wireless network performance."}
