He utilizes this understanding to build his Time Machine, which allows him to travel through time by manipulating a lever that controls the machine's movement in the time dimension. The machine functions by disturbing the rhythm of the vibrations that make up the space-time continuum, allowing the Time Traveller to displace himself in time while remaining in the same location in space. The machine is powered by a power unit, which converts continuous motion into periodic effects, driving a complex system of levers and gears that propel it through time. The time machine also has a saddle, steering wheel, and foot pedals to control its direction and speed in the time dimension.", "ground_truth": "The Time Traveller explains time as a fourth dimension comparable to space, where consciousness typically moves in one direction, and he uses this concept to create a machine that can travel through time, freely moving forward and backward."}
