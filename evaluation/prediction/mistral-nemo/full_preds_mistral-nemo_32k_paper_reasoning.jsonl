The algorithm complexity of the predictor function in SVM is linear (O(1)), while that of Softmax is exponential (O(n)). As a result, SVM allows for faster computations, leading to improved efficiency in terms of both training and testing time, which was shown in the experiment results.", "ground_truth": "The use of SVM in the GRU-SVM model results in reduced prediction time because SVM's prediction complexity is O(1), allowing constant time predictions, whereas Softmax has a prediction complexity of O(n), which increases with the number of classes.

This is because smaller LMs tend to have stronger tendencies to produce undesirable patterns (e.g., repetition), and contrastive decoding aims to exploit these differences and filter out these undesired behaviors. Also, smaller LMs have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors, which highlights their counter-intuitive outputs and emphasizes the differences with larger LMs. Thus, it is beneficial to use a smaller LM as the amateur model in contrastive decoding.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models. This design allows larger scale contrasts between models, resulting in higher quality text generation."}

This makes the task of solving the challenge much easier for LLMs, leading to improved performance with fewer resources.\n2. **Narrowing Down Relevant Inferences**: By discovering a task-specific reasoning structure, SELF-DISCOVER helps the model focus on relevant inferences, pruning the search space for finding the correct answer. This is especially beneficial for tasks requiring complex reasoning steps, where an extensive search could be costly.\n3. **Sequential Decoding**: SELF-DISCOVER's final stage involves decoding the solution following the discovered structure, which allows for targeted information processing and more precise answers. This step-by-step decoding helps LLMs reason and generate better responses efficiently.\n\nThese unique advantages of SELF-DISCOVER lead to significant improvements in task performance, especially for complex problems, while being more computational efficient than methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting.", "ground_truth": "SELF-DISCOVER improves task performance efficiently by composing reasoning structures based on atomic reasoning modules, which leverage various cognitive strategies in a structured manner. This modular integration allows it to outperform more inference-heavy methods like CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting with substantially fewer inference calls, as it requires only three initial meta-prompt steps and applies a universal reasoning structure consistently. Thus, it achieves better results by optimizing the reasoning process at the task level, rather than through repetitive and computationally expensive inference sampling."}

This helps LLMs generate relevant inferences about potential challenges that characters might face, expanding the initial observations. For example, in a scenario where Sally leaves before Anne moves a marble, the model might generate 'Sally will look for the marble in the wrong place' as a potential future event.\n\n2. **Reflect on Actionable Steps**: After generating potential future events, FaR guides models to consider whether they can provide help immediately. This process prunes irrelevant inferences and focuses on actionable steps. For example, if Sally might not know how to play with the marble, the model might generate 'Can I help her with playing the marble' as a potential action.\n\nBy breaking down the reasoning process into these two structured steps, FaR helps LLMs connect relevant inferences about future events with the intended action choices, completing a reasoning chain that spans Observation-Inferences-Action. This structured approach is particularly effective because it leverages the strong generative capabilities of LLMs while guiding their reasoning process, preventing them from getting lost in the unconstrained latent inference space.\n\nCompared to other zero-shot prompting methods, FaR is more effective because:\n\n- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: CoT provides few hints on what tasks to perform, as it only asks models to generate reasoning steps. FaR, in contrast, guides models to anticipate potential future events and reflect on actionable steps, providing more explicit directions.\n\n- **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**: ToT prompts models to simulate a discussion among domain experts, with each expert providing a reasoning step. However, the task they face (coming up with an action choice) is quite different from a discussion on domain expertise. FaR, on the other hand, is specifically designed to elicit action-oriented reasoning steps.\n\n- **Self-Ask**: Self-Ask prompts models to generate and answer their follow-up questions, but it does not provide guidance on what types of questions to ask. FaR explicitly guides models to generate questions related to likely future events and potential challenges.\n\nIn summary, the structured approach and explicit guidance provided by FaR make it particularly effective in helping LLMs address the challenges of the T4D task compared to other zero-shot prompting methods.", "ground_truth": "The FaR framework helps LLMs tackle T4D's challenges by structuring reasoning through future event prediction (Foresee) and action-oriented reflection (Reflect), thus guiding the model to make appropriate inferences and actions. It is effective because it aligns deeply with human-like decision-making, enabling LLMs to connect observations to actions efficiently, improving their zero-shot performance more significantly than traditional methods like Chain-of-Thought or Self-Ask, which lack such a structured reasoning approach."}

This limitation in LLMs' abilities impacts their performance in autonomous driving by causing them to struggle with long-tail data, dynamic scenes, and complex traffic environment, leading to the need for human oversight to ensure safety and reliability.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms. This limitation indicates that LLMs are better at approximate retrieval of plans rather than actual planning, leading to unreliable and often incorrect plan generation when used autonomously."}

The acceleration recording shows that Co-driver has less fluctuation of acceleration, calculated by dividing the concatenation of the indices of relative minima and maxima by the total time, which leads to smoother driving. The method used for comparison is to calculate the frequency of fluctuations, represented by the ratio of the frequency of fluctuations to the running time.", "ground_truth": "The Co-driver system ensures smoother driving behaviors by dynamically adjusting to environmental inputs, such as weather and light conditions, which the default agent does not consider. This adaptiveness is quantified using the frequency of acceleration fluctuations, denoted as 𝔽T.

Additionally, the LLM+LLM system's marginal improvement over the generator-LLM-only method might be due to backprompting rather than the LLM verifier.", "ground_truth": "The LLM+LLM backprompting system underperforms because the verifier LLM produces a significant number of false positives, declaring incorrect plans as valid, which undermines the reliability of the system.

Additionally, the backpropagation algorithm for both models is the same, which further contributes to the GRU-SVM model's faster performance.}", "ground_truth": "The GRU-SVM model achieves faster prediction and testing times because the SVM decision function has a computational complexity of O(1), which means it requires a fixed number of operations regardless of input size.

These improvements might not have been implemented in the FFNN-ReLU model used in the paper, but they could still perform comparably to FFNN-Softmax due to other factors such as the specific architecture, hyperparameters, or data characteristics of the Fashion-MNIST dataset.", "ground_truth": "Despite the dying neurons problem often faced by ReLU, the FFNN-ReLU model still performs comparably with the FFNN-Softmax model for the Fashion-MNIST dataset because both models exhibit similar precision, recall, and F1-scores, suggesting that the dataset characteristics allow the ReLU model to maintain efficacy.

This is due to the fact that KTO is designed to learn from whether a given output is desirable or undesirable for a given input, regardless of external factors like trustworthiness or preferences of annotators.", "ground_truth": "The KTO approach leverages a binary signal to maximize utility directly, benefiting from a human-aware loss function that incorporates cognitive biases like loss aversion.

This allows for more efficient inference by limiting cache memory usage without impacting model quality.", "ground_truth": "The Rolling Buffer Cache reduces memory overhead by maintaining a fixed cache size of W and overwriting past values as the sequence progresses beyond W.

This variation could affect the overall performance of LLMs when evaluated across diverse subjects.\n\n4. **Are Subtle Cultural Context:** Some subjects, especially the humanities, may require an understanding of indirect context, cultural norms, or historical background that the LLMs might not grasp completely.\n\n5. **Human Evaluation Bias:** Since some subjects are targeted more in human evaluation (e.g., widespread use of multiple-choice questions in sciences), LLMs might focus more on these areas, showing better performance on them.", "ground_truth": "The subject bias observed in LLM performance on the GAOKAO benchmark, as noted in paper 2, can be attributed to the distinct competencies required for different subjects. For instance, language comprehension and summarization skills are necessary for Chinese and English, while mathematics and physics demand more significant logical reasoning and computational ability.

LLMs struggle with managing long-context information, especially when dealing with multiple constraints.\n3. **Lack of Awareness of Environment Updates**: In real-world scenarios, agents must adapt to changes in the environment, such as unavailable flights or attractions. LLMs currently lack a mechanism to track and adapt to such dynamic updates.\n4. **Limited Ability to Integrate Tool Use**: While some LLMs have shown progress in using tools (like Schick et al., 2023), they still struggle to effectively utilize various tools to gather necessary information and deliberate over the collected information to further the planning while being mindful of all the explicit and implicit constraints.\n5. **Inability to Make Diverse Decisions**: LLMs sometimes struggle to generate diverse outputs, crucial for tasks that require exploring multiple options, like choosing between different room types, cuisines, or activities.\n\nThese challenges, along with the current state of LLM development, lead the authors to conclude that more work is necessary to train agents capable of handling complex, multi-constraint tasks in real-world settings.", "ground_truth": "The authors of paper 0 suggest that language agents struggle with complex multi-constraint tasks in TravelPlanner because they often fail to appropriately manage multiple constraints due to their inability to handle prompted information comprehensively and holistically.

In traditional attention, cache size increases with sequence length, which requires more resources and slows down the model.

However, it offers better mean performance, is more robust, and does not require decisions on which languages to prioritize when budget is limited, making it a preferred method for resource allocation.", "ground_truth": "The cost of multilingual instruction tuning is the same as tuning individual models for each language, as both require \\(N \times C_{Alpaca}\\) to support \\(N\\) languages.

The verifier LLM yields a significant number of false positives, which can undermine the system's reliability, especially in domains where correctness is paramount. 2.

This approach is motivated by the observation that Post-LN suffered from unstable training, while Pre-LN converged successfully without requiring a warm-up start or a specific initialization strategy. By analyzing the architecture, Liu et al. demonstrate that Pre-LN limits the dependency on each layer's residual output, while Post-LN relaxes this restriction.
