As a result, Alex becomes more inclusive and caring towards his peers, feeling sympathy and inspiration for the first time.", "ground_truth": "The narrator experiences a sudden realization of being 'different' when a girl refuses to accept his visiting card, making him aware of the 'vast veil' separating him from the others.

They can be repeatedly deceived, losing their land and accumulated wealth. Even when they purchase farms with installments, they risk becoming landless.\n\n2. **Economic Exploitation**: White storekeepers exploit black farmers by buying their crops at low prices and selling them goods on credit at high prices. This leads to persistent debt.\n\n3. **Lack of Economic Freedom**: Many farmers are trapped in debt-bondage, forced to work on plantations without wages or with minimal pay. This system, similar to slavery, hinders their ascent to financial independence.", "ground_truth": "The black farmer, often under the crop-lien system, has to rent land and borrow heavily for supplies at inflated prices, leaving almost no room for profit.

This, coupled with their exclusion from higher education and the deliberate undermining of their civil rights, creates an environment where economic advancement is severely hindered.", "ground_truth": "The author argues that disfranchisement leaves Black citizens voiceless in shaping the laws and policies under which they live and work, leading to their exploitation. Without political power, they cannot influence taxation, law enforcement, or labor conditions, which undermines the long-term economic development of both Black laborers and the broader Southern economy that relies on their labor."}
