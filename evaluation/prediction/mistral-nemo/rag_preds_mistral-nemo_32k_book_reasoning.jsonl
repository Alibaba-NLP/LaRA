In chess, errors occur due to lapses in attention, while in draughts (with four kings), only analytical acumen decides victory, as no attention errors are possible.", "ground_truth": "The narrator concludes that draughts better exercises the intellect because, unlike chess where attention is heavily taxed due to the complexity of piece movements, draughts relies on simple, limited moves. This simplicity, allowing for fewer oversights, shifts the focus to acumen and intellectual engagement with the opponent's strategy, whereas chess often rewards sheer concentration."}

The voices heard by various witnesses didn't match any known language, being unlike any heard before. Additionally, the gruff and shrill nature of the voices, combined with their quick and unequal pitch, suggested a non-human source.", "ground_truth": "Verne notes that the strength required to tear out tresses of hair and thrust a body up the chimney, along with the bizarre nature of the injuries and the unusual hand impressions on the victim's throat, indicate the actions of a non-human. Additionally, the voice heard by witnesses was not comprehensible, adding to the strangeness of the scene. These factors combined led him to reason that the culprit was not human but an animal, specifically an Ourang-Outang."}

He finds hidden springs that enabled the sashes to close, but the nails could not be replaced from the outside. Therefore, the assassins must have escaped through the other window that also had a nail, proving their exit through the windows.", "ground_truth": "Verne concludes that since both doors were locked with the keys inside, and the chimneys were too narrow, the only possible mode of egress was through the window. By investigating further, he finds a hidden spring that could allow the window to appear locked from the inside after the escape, proving that the killers did indeed flee through the window."}
