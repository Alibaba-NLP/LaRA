This is due to:\n\n1. **Lower Modeling Capacity**: Smaller models are more prone to errors and have less modeling capacity, so they exhibit more undesirable behaviors like repetition, incoherence, or generating irrelevant text.\n2. **Magnifying Differences**: By taking the difference between expert and amateur log-probabilities, contrastive decoding amplifies the expert's good behaviors and diminishes the amateur's bad behaviors. This is effective because smaller models are more likely to produce unwanted outputs.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models.

These predictions act as heuristics, guiding the reasoning process towards relevant inferences.\n\n2. **Reflect**: In this stage, LLMs reason about which action choice best helps characters facing predicted challenges. This is similar to path pruning in A* search, narrowing down inferred events based on available actions.\n\nFaR is particularly effective compared to other zero-shot prompting methods because:\n\n- **Other methods** largely focus on step-by-step reasoning (CoT), expert discussions (ToT), or self-inquiry (Self-Ask).

This condition ensures that the active devices' local models are representative of the overall global model.\n\n2. **Bounded Gradient Norm and Smoothness**: The assumptions that the gradients are bounded and that the objective function is smooth are crucial for the convergence analysis. These conditions guarantee that the model updates are stable and do not diverge.\n\nTo ensure these assumptions hold:\n\n- **iid Data Distribution**: The data across all devices should be independently and identically distributed. This is a strong assumption and might not hold in practice, especially when data is non-IID.\n- **Bounded Gradients**: The gradients calculated on local data should be bounded. This is typically ensured by normalization techniques or careful problem formulation.\n- **Smooth Objective Function**: The objective function should be smooth, meaning that small changes in inputs result in small changes in outputs. This is usually guaranteed by the nature of the problem or the use of appropriate activation functions.\n\nThese assumptions allow for a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)$ for FedAvg with partial device participation.", "ground_truth": "Theorem 3 ensures convergence of FedAvg with partial device participation by employing Assumption 6, which requires a balanced data distribution where each device's data is representative of the overall dataset. For these assumptions to hold, the aggregation step uses uniform sampling without replacement and assumes equal weight distributions across devices. The scheme requires the data to be balanced (i.e., each device holds data with equal probability distribution), enabling the variance introduced by partial device participation to be controlled, thereby ensuring convergence at the given rate."}

Key advantage:\n\n- **LLM-generated pseudo-docs** often contain highly relevant, unambiguous information that can guide retrievers and improve disambiguation.\n- **No reliance on initial retriever's performance**. Unlike PRF, LLM-generated pseudo-docs don't depend on the quality of initial retrieve, making query2doc more robust.", "ground_truth": "The query2doc method differs from traditional pseudo-relevance feedback by generating pseudo-documents using LLMs instead of relying on feedback signals from the top-k documents obtained in initial retrieval steps. This approach does not depend on the quality of initial retrieval results, which are often noisy, and uses cutting-edge LLMs to produce documents likely containing relevant terms, improving the robustness of query expansion."}

This additional verbosity enhances the model's ability to generate diverse and relevant query terms, thereby improving both recall and top-heavy ranking metrics like MRR@10 and NDCG@10, as the model assembles potential keywords from its expansive reasoning process."}

This improves keyword discovery compared to simple thresholding, which only considers direct word similarities.", "ground_truth": "The graph-based manifold representation in LGDE captures the local nonlinear geometry of word embeddings, allowing it to account for chains of word associations as paths on the graph, which simple thresholding might miss.

A smaller size (e.g., 1) may not capture enough context, while a larger size (e.g., 5) might include too much noise. Thus, size 3 optimizes the trade-off between signal and noise, leading to the most significant MRR improvements.", "ground_truth": "The choice of a neighborhood size of 3 is particularly effective because it provides a balanced amount of comparative information by considering a manageable number of neighboring items both above and below the target item. This size allows the model to capture relevant context without being overwhelmed by too much distant information, leading to a significant improvement in MRR by around 5%, which suggests an optimal balance between relevance and contextual influence."}

Specifically, using positional encodings (PE) with the ordinal loss results in an NDCG@5 score of 52.67, which is higher than using self-attention without PE (52.20). This suggests that positional encodings help the model capture order information, beneficial for re-ranking settings.", "ground_truth": "The application of positional encodings in re-ranking settings allows the model to leverage positional information, resulting in improved performance over the plain ranking setting without positional encodings. This is evidenced by the higher NDCG@5 results achieved when positional encodings are used, as shown by the comparison of performance with and without positional encodings in Table 4."}

In terms of node-level parallelism, tests showed that Fujitsu A64FX provided the best performance among the CPUs, nearly matching NVIDIA's V100 GPU (see Figure 6).

This allows for a high degree of concurrency, as each PE can operate on its local slice of the grid simultaneously and independently.", "ground_truth": "The authors ensure full utilization of the WSE's processing capabilities by mapping the X and Y dimensions of the 3D grid onto the processor fabric and storing the Z dimension entirely within the local memory of each processing element.

One study found that LLMs can't recognize or improve upon fortuitously correct solutions, often leading to incorrect outcomes.", "ground_truth": "The authors criticize this belief because LLMs cannot effectively verify their own plans; without training on 'corrections data,' there's no guarantee their critiques will be relevant or correct.

Additionally, if a model is initially well-aligned with a well-designed prompt, further feedback may skew responses away from optimal, thus lowering performance instead of improving it."}

These bias terms and chunk lengths vary for each training example, exposing the model to diverse relative positions. Internally, continuous indices within each chunk resemble the pre-training structure, preserving the model's original abilities.", "ground_truth": "PoSE retains the pre-trained capabilities by ensuring the continuity of position indices within each chunk during fine-tuning, which closely resembles the structure of pre-training.
