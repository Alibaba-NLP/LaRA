Each category reflects a different stage of how the model interacts with and incorporates new knowledge.", "ground_truth": "The authors categorize knowledge editing methods into recognition, association, and mastery phases by drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes. This categorization mirrors the steps through which humans learn, starting from exposure to new knowledge, linking it to existing information, and finally integrating it fully into their cognitive structures, reflecting how LLMs might process and utilize knowledge similarly."}

This complexity complicates the precise delineation of knowledge boundaries and access to parametric knowledge, challenging the LLM's capability to perform effective knowledge fusion, especially when model-specific parametric knowledge must supplement the external information."}

Specifically:\n\n- **LoRA**: Provides a low-rank adaptation, reducing the number of trainable parameters.\n- **Subspace Training**: Projects parameters into a low-dimensional subspace, enhancing compressibility.\n\nBy integrating LoRA with subspace training, SubLoRA achieves both high expressivity and extreme compressibility, which is crucial for obtaining non-vacuous generalization bounds. This combination allows for a smooth trade-off between model complexity and empirical risk, often being the deciding factor in whether the bounds are vacuous or non-vacuous.", "ground_truth": "The combination of SubLoRA improves upon using LoRA and subspace training separately by exploiting different structures in the parameter space, offering a family of compressible yet expressive models. SubLoRA provides a smoother trade-off between model complexity and empirical risk, yielding the best bounds and achieving non-vacuous generalization bounds where LoRA alone results in vacuous bounds for Top-1 Error, confirming its enhanced capacity for compressing and generalizing large models."}

These measures can prevent the entrenchment of single, overly simplistic views which fail to represent diverse social realities."}

Specifically, it uses data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism to distribute the model across multiple GPUs, mixed precision to reduce memory consumption, and gradient accumulation to manage memory for activations. This allows the model to fit within the memory constraints of available GPUs and to train efficiently on large clusters.", "ground_truth": "Megatron-Turing NLG 530B utilizes a 3D parallelism strategy, which includes a combination of data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism techniques. This approach allows for reduction in memory consumption by distributing the computational load and memory storage across multiple GPUs, while maintaining compute efficiency by organizing the parallel operations in a way that optimally utilizes the high computation and communication bandwidth between GPUs."}

However, it has higher memory management overheads, leading to increased decompression latency and potential performance penalties.\n- **zbud**: Offers a simple and fast pool management technique, storing a maximum of two compressed objects in a 4 KB region. This results in lower space efficiency (maximum 50% compression) but lower memory management overheads, which is better for performance with minimal TCO savings.\n- **z3fold**: Similar to zbud but can store three compressed objects in a 4 KB region, providing a balance between space efficiency and performance. It offers better compression than zbud while maintaining relatively low memory management overheads.\n\nThus, zsmalloc is suitable for configurations aiming for higher TCO savings with acceptable performance, while zbud and z3fold are better for configurations prioritizing performance with moderate TCO savings.", "ground_truth": "The choice of memory allocator impacts the trade-off as zsmalloc creates high memory TCO savings due to dense packing of compressed objects but incurs higher memory management overhead, thus increasing latency. In contrast, zbud offers faster access with lower management overhead but provides less TCO savings due to storing fewer compressed objects, thus shaping how aggressively data can be placed in compressed tiers without impacting performance significantly."}
