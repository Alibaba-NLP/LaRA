Choosing a smaller model as the amateur LM is beneficial because:\n\n1. **Lower Capacity**: Smaller models have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors, making them suitable for identifying failure modes that the expert model should avoid.\n2. **Temperature Tuning**: Adjusting the temperature of the amateur LM can manipulate its behavior, allowing for more control over what aspects of the amateur's output are penalized.\n3. **Context Window**: Restricting the context window of the amateur LM further weakens its coherence, enhancing the contrast with the expert LM and improving the coherence of the generated text.\n\nBy leveraging these properties, contrastive decoding can produce higher-quality text that emphasizes the strengths of the expert LM while mitigating its weaknesses.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly.

Specifically:\n\n1. **Variance Control**: The term \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} p_{k}^2 \\sigma_{k}^2 \\) represents the weighted sum of the variances of the gradients on each device. This term must be finite and bounded to ensure that the noise in the gradients does not dominate the convergence.\n\n2. **Heterogeneity Control**: The term \\( \\Gamma \\) captures the heterogeneity of the data distribution across devices.

Setting \\( E \\) too large can lead to divergence due to increased drift between local models.\n\n4. **Sampling Scheme**: The devices are sampled according to a distribution \\( p_k \\) independently and with replacement.
