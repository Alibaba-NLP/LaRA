Shareholders' equity on Jan 29, 2023: $22,101 million\n2. Shareholders' equity on Jan 28, 2024: $42,978 million\n3. Change in shareholders' equity: $42,978M - $22,101M = $20,877M\n\n4. Change in shared outstanding:\n   - Shares outstanding on Jan 29, 2023: 2,466M\n   - Shares outstanding on Jan 28, 2024: 2,464M\n   - Change: 2,464M - 2,466M = -2M\n\n5. Impact on equity per share:\n   - Jan 29, 2023 EPS: $4,368M / 2,466M shares = $1.76\n   - Jan 28, 2024 EPS: $29,760M / 2,464M shares = $12.05\n   - Change in EPS: $12.05 - $1.76 = $10.29 per share\n\n6. Contribution of share change to equity:\n   - (-2M shares) * ($10.29/share) = -$20.58M\n\nSo, the change in shared outstanding contributed approximately -$20.58M to the increase in total shareholders' equity from $22,101M to $42,978M, or about -0.1% of the total change.", "ground_truth": "The number of shares outstanding decreased from 2,466 million to 2,464 million, a reduction by 2 million shares, primarily due to repurchases. This change, along with an increase in net income retained compared to dividends paid, contributed to a rise in total shareholders' equity from $22,101 million to $42,978 million, with the net income significantly boosting retained earnings."}
