His work had a direct impact, bringing \"one more star to life\" or \"one flower to bloom\" depending on the time of day.\n2. Unlike the others, the Lamplighter's work had some meaning, unlike the Monarch of Celestia, Egomaniac Emperor, Winebibber, and Businessman whose jobs seemed absurd or trivial.\n3. Stellar boy admired the Lamplighter's faithfulness to his routine, even though it caused him hardship.", "ground_truth": "Stellar boy thought the Lamplighter's job was more meaningful because by lighting the lamp, the Lamplighter brought one more star or flower to life, and by extinguishing it, he sent them to sleep. This work, in stellar boy's view, had genuine beauty and utility, unlike the self-absorbed or nonsensical tasks of the other grown-ups he had met."}

While she looks like the other roses, she is unique to him because of the time and care he invested in her.", "ground_truth": "Stellar boy understands that his rose is unique because it is the one he has cared for and formed a bond with—he has watered it, protected it, and listened to it. This connection, or 'taming' as explained by the Vulpes Wisewhisper, makes his rose special, even though it appears outwardly similar to the other roses in the garden."}

Each rejected drawing reveals more about the little prince's concerns and the complexity of his relationship with his flower.", "ground_truth": "The little prince rejects the first drawings because one sheep is too sickly, another is a ram, and the last one is too old. Ultimately, what he seeks isn't a perfect physical representation of a sheep but rather something imaginative and practical. Once the narrator draws a box, saying the sheep is inside, the little prince is satisfied because it allows him to project his own imagination onto the drawing, fitting his need for a small sheep for his planet."}

Chess has varied and complex moves, making it seem profound, but draughts, with its simpler moves, allows for more reliance on superior acumen rather than complex calculations. Draughts minimizes the chance of oversight due to its simpler rules, thus more effectively challenging and developing the intellect's ability to infer and deduce.", "ground_truth": "The narrator concludes that draughts better exercises the intellect because, unlike chess where attention is heavily taxed due to the complexity of piece movements, draughts relies on simple, limited moves. This simplicity, allowing for fewer oversights, shifts the focus to acumen and intellectual engagement with the opponent's strategy, whereas chess often rewards sheer concentration."}

He finds that the police had overlooked the possibility of the windows being used because they assumed the sashes were fastened from the inside. However, Verne discovers hidden springs in the windows that allow them to open. He then examines the nails in the sashes and finds that one nail is broken, suggesting it was used to fasten the window after opening. This leads him to conclude the murderer escaped through the window with the broken nail.", "ground_truth": "Verne reasons that since both windows were found fastened from the inside, the police wrongly concluded that no one could have exited through them. However, Verne discovers a cleverly concealed spring mechanism and a broken nail at one window, indicating that the window could close and appear undisturbed after someone exited, thus revealing it as the murderer's escape route."}

The strength required to thrust the bodies up the chimney.\n2. The ferocity and brutality of the crimes.\n3. The unusual agility implied by the Ourang-Outang's escape.\n4. The presence of non-human hair and the specific finger-like indentations on the victims' throats, which match descriptions of an Ourang-Outang's anatomy.", "ground_truth": "Verne notes that the strength required to tear out tresses of hair and thrust a body up the chimney, along with the bizarre nature of the injuries and the unusual hand impressions on the victim's throat, indicate the actions of a non-human. Additionally, the voice heard by witnesses was not comprehensible, adding to the strangeness of the scene. These factors combined led him to reason that the culprit was not human but an animal, specifically an Ourang-Outang."}

He examines the windows and finds that the police overlooked the fact that the shutters of the fourth-story windows were ferrades, which provided a handhold. He determines that the shutter by the bed could be swung fully back to reach the lightning rod, allowing the murderer to enter and exit the window. Verne concludes that the unusual agility required to do this supports his theory of the murderer's extraordinary abilities.", "ground_truth": "Verne concludes that since both doors were locked with the keys inside, and the chimneys were too narrow, the only possible mode of egress was through the window. By investigating further, he finds a hidden spring that could allow the window to appear locked from the inside after the escape, proving that the killers did indeed flee through the window."}

He senses the fish's nobility and strength, which he respects, but ultimately feels a duty to kill it to provide for others (\"I must kill him and keep strong to do it\"). This mix of affection and duty stems from his deep connection to the sea and its creatures, as well as his desire to feed and support those who depend on his catches.", "ground_truth": "Guillermo admires the fish for its strength and beauty, even calling it his 'brother.'

He believes it was too good to last and wonders if he should have let the fish live. He struggles with the morality of killing the fish, despite needing to survive and feed others.", "ground_truth": "Guillermo feels conflicted because he both loves and respects the fish for its beauty, strength, and nobility.
