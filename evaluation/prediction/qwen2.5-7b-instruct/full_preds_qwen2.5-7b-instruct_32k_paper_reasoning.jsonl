Smaller LMs have lower modeling capacity and are more prone to errors, which helps highlight the failures of the larger expert LM.\n\n2. It allows the method to exploit the differences between the expert and amateur LMs more effectively.\n\n3. The optimal design is to select the largest LM as the expert and the smallest one as the amateur, as seen in the experiments.\n\n4.

A smaller amateur LM emphasizes the failure modes of the expert LM, which are more common in smaller models.", "ground_truth": "The choice of an amateur language model influences the performance of contrastive decoding because smaller models tend to exhibit undesirable patterns like repetition and incoherence more strongly. By contrasting a larger expert model with a smaller amateur, contrastive decoding effectively emphasizes desirable language features by penalizing amateur-like errors, which are prevalent in smaller models.

This limitation impacts their performance as only about 12% of the plans generated by the best LLM (GPT-4) are executable and reach their goals.", "ground_truth": "The primary reason the authors believe LLMs are not suitable for planning in autonomous mode is their inability to generate executable plans accurately, with studies showing only about 12% success without errors, and their performance deteriorating further with obfuscated domain terms.

Instead of using top retrieved documents as pseudo-relevant feedback, query2doc uses LLMs to generate pseudo-documents conditioned on few-shot prompts.\n\n2. This allows query2doc to generate more relevant and varied information than just top retrieved documents.\n\n3. The LLM-generated pseudo-documents often contain highly relevant information that can aid in query disambiguation and guide retrievers.\n\n4.

The verifier LLM produces a significant number of false positives, compromising the system's reliability.\n2. Detailed feedback on invalid plans does not significantly enhance LLM performance.\n3.
