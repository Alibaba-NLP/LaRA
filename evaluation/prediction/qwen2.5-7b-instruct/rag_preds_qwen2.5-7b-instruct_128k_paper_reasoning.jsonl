It does this through two sub-models: a translation sub-model and a coreference resolution sub-model. The coreference resolution sub-model predicts coreference clusters by fusing representations from both the encoder and decoder to capture explicit relations between the two languages. This helps the model utilize correct context features, improving translation quality and reducing the explain-away effect.", "ground_truth": "The context-aware MT model enhances translation quality by incorporating coreference clusters into the translation process using additional contextual features from both source and target representations. By predicting coreference information, the model captures necessary relationships between mentions, which ensures coherence and accuracy in translation, particularly in cases involving longer contexts. This fusion of coreference-based context allows the model to select useful information more effectively than previous methods, resulting in superior BLEU scores and improved handling of discourse phenomena."}

This reduces the ring fragmentation probability by a factor of approximately 5.2 compared to bare pyrrole, where fragmentation typically occurs through the breaking of C-C or N-C covalent bonds.", "ground_truth": "The water molecule in pyrrole(H2O) acts as a radiation protection agent by providing alternative relaxation pathways such as the dissociative release of neutral water or the transfer of an electron or proton across the hydrogen bond.
